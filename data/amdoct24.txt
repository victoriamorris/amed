     AB: Abstract. Aims. To explore whether gait and/or balance 
     disturbances are associated with the onset of Alzheimer's dementia 
     (AD) among older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
     (MCI). Design. This study employed a longitudinal retrospective 
     cohort design. Methods. We obtained data from the National 
     Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set collected from 35 
     National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers 
     between September 2005 and December 2021. The mean age of 
     participants (n = 2692) was 74.5 years with women making up 47.2% of 
     the sample. Risk of incident AD according to baseline gait and/or 
     balance disturbances as measured using the Postural Instability and 
     Gait Disturbance Score, a subscale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease 
     Rating Scale Motor Score, was examined by the Cox proportional 
     hazards regression models adjusting for baseline demographics, 
     medical conditions and study sites. The mean follow-up duration was 
     4.0 years.Results. Among all the participants, the presence or the 
     severity of gait and/or balance disturbances was associated with an 
     increased risk of AD. The presence or the severity of gait and/or 
     balance disturbances was associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's 
     dementia among the subgroups of female and male participants. 
     Conclusion. Gait and/or balance disturbances may increase the risk of 
     developing AD, regardless of sex. Impact. Gait and/or balance 
     disturbances among community-dwelling older adults with amnestic MCI 
     may need to be frequently assessed by nurses to identify potential 
     risk factors for cognitive decline. No patient or public 
     contribution. Given the secondary analysis, patients, service users, 
     caregivers or members of the public were not directly involved in 
     this study.]

     AB: Abstract. Aims. To investigate the level of spiritual health in 
     older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from 
     the core dimensions and to explore its associated factors. Design. A 
     cross-sectional study. Methods. Participants were recruited from four 
     hospitals between September 2020 and June 2021, using a convenience 
     sampling. Older patients with COPD (n = 162) completed the 
     demographic and disease-related information questionnaires, Function 
     Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Scale, 10-item 
     Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, General Self-efficacy Scale, Social 
     Support Rating Scale, COPD Assessment Test, 15-item Geriatric 
     Depression Scale and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale. 
     Descriptive statistics, Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses, 
     t-tests, one-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression models were 
     used. Results. Older patients with COPD have a moderate level of 
     spiritual health. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that 
     psychological resilience, general self-efficacy, social support, 
     symptom burden and monthly income were associated with the core 
     dimensions of spiritual health. Conclusion. Chinese older patients 
     with COPD have a moderate level of spiritual health. Psychological 
     resilience, general self-efficacy, social support, monthly income and 
     symptom burden were associated with the core dimensions of spiritual 
     health. Impact. This study is the first to investigate the level of 
     spiritual health in older patients with COPD from the core dimensions 
     and to explore its associated factors, providing a basis for 
     developing spiritual intervention programs. Our findings can help us 
     realize that intervention strategies of psychological resilience, 
     general self-efficacy and social support can all be used to enhance 
     spiritual health. Nurses should focus on the spiritual health of 
     older COPD patients with high symptom burden and low monthly income. 
     Patient or Public Contribution. Although we did not directly involve 
     patients and the public because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results 
     of the study will be disseminated to patients and the public through 
     WeChat and seminars.]

     AB: Abstract. As the lower extremity is a linked-joint system, the 
     contribution of movements at the hip and ankle, in addition to the 
     knee, to gait patterns should be considered for persons with knee 
     osteoarthritis (OA). However, the relationships of joint coordination 
     variability to OA symptoms, particularly knee pain, and joint loading 
     is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the 
     relationship of joint coordination variability to knee pain severity 
     and joint loading in persons with knee OA. Thirty-four participants 
     with knee OA underwent gait analysis. Vector coding was used to 
     assess coordination variability during the early, mid, and late 
     stance phase. Hip-knee coupling angle variability (CAV) during 
     midstance was associated with Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
     Score (KOOS) pain (r = −0.50, p = 0.002) and Visual Analog Scale pain 
     (r = 0.36, p = 0.04). Knee-ankle CAV during midstance was associated 
     with KOOS pain (r = −0.34, p = 0.05). Hip-knee CAV during early and 
     midstance were associated with knee flexion moment (KFM) impulses (r 
     = −0.46, p = 0.01). Knee-ankle CAV during early and midstance were 
     associated with peak KFM (r = −0.51, p < 0.01; r = −0.70, p < 0.01). 
     Moreover, knee-ankle CAV during early, mid, and late stance phase 
     were associated with KFM impulses (r = −0.53, p < 0.01; r = −0.70, p 
     < 0.01; r = −0.54, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that joint 
     coordination variability may be a factor that influences pain and 
     knee joint loading in persons with knee OA. Statement of Clinical 
     Significance: Movement coordination of the hip, knee, and ankle 
     should be considered in the clinical management and future research 
     related to knee OA.]

     AB: Abstract. Identifying potential contributing factors for physical 
     inactivity in people with knee osteoarthritis is vital for designing 
     practical activity promoting interventions. Walking is a common 
     activity, but it is unknown how gait characteristics may influence 
     physical activity and if psychological factors, specifically fear of 
     movement (kinesiophobia), contribute to this relationship. The aim of 
     our study was to investigate the contributions of select gait 
     parameters and kinesiophobia to activity levels. Cross-sectional data 
     from 40 participants (F 24|M 16; age 57.6 ± 8.9 years; BMI 34.7 ± 7.0 
     kg/m2) with uni- or bilateral knee osteoarthritis were included. 
     Physical activity and kinesiophobia were assessed by self-report 
     using the University of California, Los Angeles activity rating 
     scale, and Tampa scale for kinesiophobia, respectively. Gait 
     parameters were collected with three-dimensional gait analysis while 
     participants walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill at a 
     self-selected speed. Higher peak sagittal plane joint moments at the 
     ankle (ρ = 0.418, p = 0.007), and hip (ρ = 0.348, p = 0.028), faster 
     self-selected gait speed (ρ = 0.553, p < 0.001), and less 
     kinesiophobia or fear of movement (ρ = −0.695, p < 0.001) were 
     independently related to higher physical activity level in adults 
     with knee osteoarthritis. In hierarchical regression models, after 
     accounting for covariates, only self-selected gait speed, and 
     kinesiophobia significantly contributed to explaining the variation 
     in physical activity level. Statement of clinical significance: 
     Interventions aimed at improving physical activity participation in 
     those with lower limb osteoarthritis should consider assessing the 
     contribution of pain-related fear of movement.]

     AB: Abstract. The study aimed to define the load on hands using 
     various commonly used types of crutches while walking with a full 
     load on both legs (FL), with 20 kg partial load (PL), or with the 
     left leg wholly unloaded (UL). Twenty-six healthy subjects used 
     crutches with ergonomic handles, with anatomic handles (wider and 
     softer bearing surface), and arthritis crutches (horizontal 
     supporting area for the forearm). Sensor mats between hand and 
     handles continuously measured the load transmitted, while sensor 
     soles in the shoes recorded the ground reaction forces 
     simultaneously. The load on the palm and separately the radial and 
     ulnar halves of the palm were analyzed. With arthritis crutches, 
     significantly lower load was transferred to the hands compared to 
     forearm crutches (FL 3% vs. 25% of body weight, PL 8% vs. 87%, UL 12% 
     vs. 103%). The load on hands increased significantly from FL to PL 
     and UL for both types of crutches. The ipsilateral left hand had to 
     bear significantly more load than the right hand. However, the feet's 
     time-ground reaction curves showed more irregularities, and PL on the 
     left leg was significantly higher with arthritis crutches. Anatomic 
     handles reduced the load on the ulnar half of the palm (FL 3% vs. 5%, 
     PL 13% vs. 18%, UL 17% vs. 23%); the radial half of the palm had a 
     similar load to bear with both types of handles (11/11%, 31/32%, 
     34/35%). Arthritis crutches allow unburdening hands at the expense of 
     gait stability. Anatomic handles reduce the load on the Guyon's 
     canal.]

     on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) 
     scores following vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in osteoporotic 
     fractures. A literature search of PubMed, EMBASE (Elsevier), CiNAHL, 
     Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of 
     Systematic Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted from 
     database inception to October 6, 2022. Eligible studies reported 
     osteoporosis patients over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of at 
     least one vertebral fracture via radiography or clinical assessment. 
     This review was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022340791). Ten 
     studies met the eligibility criteria (n = 889). VAS scores at 
     baseline were 7.75 (95% CI: 7.54, 7.97, I2 = 76.11%). Following 
     initiation of exercise, VAS scores at the endpoint of 12 months were 
     1.91 (95% CI: 1.53, 2.29, I2 = 92.69%). ODI scores at baseline were 
     68.66 (95% CI: 56.19, 81.13, I2 = 85%). Following initiation of 
     exercise, ODI scores at the endpoint of 12 months were 21.20 (95% CI: 
     14.52, 27.87, I2 = 99.30). A two-arm analysis demonstrated improved 
     VAS and ODI for the exercise group compared to non-exercise control 
     at 6 months (MD = −0.70, 95% CI: −1.08, −0.32, I2 = 87% and MD = 
     −6.48, 95% CI: −7.52, −5.44, I2 = 46%, respectively) and 12 months

     −13.24, −5.99, I2 = 93%). Refracture was the only adverse event 
     reported and occurred almost twice as frequently in the non-exercise 
     group than in the exercise group. Exercise rehabilitation post 
     vertebral augmentation is associated with improved pain and 
     functionality, particularly after 6 months of exposure, and may 
     reduce refracture rate.]

     AB: Abstract. In this cross-sectional study, we compared 
     patellofemoral geometry in individuals with a youth-sport-related 
     intra-articular knee injury to uninjured individuals, and the 
     association between patellofemoral geometry and magnetic resonance 
     imaging (MRI)-defined osteoarthritis (OA) features. In the Youth 
     Prevention of Early OA (PrE-OA) cohort, we assessed 10 patellofemoral 
     geometry measures in individuals 3-10 years following injury compared 
     with uninjured individuals of similar age, sex, and sport, using 
     mixed effects linear regression. We also dichotomized geometry to 
     identify extreme (>1.96 standard deviations) features and assessed 
     likelihood of having extreme values using Poisson regression. 
     Finally, we evaluated the associations between patellofemoral 
     geometry with MRI-defined OA features using restricted cubic spline 
     regression. Mean patellofemoral geometry did not differ substantially 
     between groups. However, compared with uninjured individuals, injured 
     individuals were more likely to have extremely large sulcus angle 
     (prevalence ratio [PR] 3.9 [95% confidence interval, CI: 2.3, 6.6]), 
     and shallow lateral trochlear inclination (PR 4.3 (1.1, 17.9)) and 
     trochlear depth (PR 5.3 (1.6, 17.4)). In both groups, high bisect 
     offset (PR 1.7 [1.3, 2.1]) and sulcus angle (PR 4.0 [2.3, 7.0]) were 
     associated with cartilage lesion, and most geometry measures were 
     associated with at least one structural feature, especially cartilage 
     lesions and osteophytes. We observed no interaction between geometry 
     and injury. Certain patellofemoral geometry features are correlated 
     with higher prevalence of structural lesions compared with injury 
     alone, 3-10 years following knee injury. Hypotheses generated in this 
     study, once further evaluated, could contribute to identifying 
     higher-risk individuals who may benefit from targeted treatment aimed 
     at preventing posttraumatic OA.]

     AB: Abstract. The foot is responsible for the bodyweight transfer to 
     the ground, while adapting to different terrains and activities. 
     Despite this fundamental role, the knowledge about the foot bone 
     intrinsic kinematics is still limited. The aim of the study is to 
     provide a quantitative and systematic description of the kinematics 
     of all bones in the foot, considering the full range of dorsi/plantar 
     flexion and pronation/supination of the foot, both in weightbearing 
     and nonweightbearing conditions. Bone kinematics was accurately 
     reconstructed for three specimens from a series of computed 
     tomography scans taken in weightbearing configuration. The ground 
     inclination was imposed through a set of wedges, varying the foot 
     orientation both in the sagittal and coronal planes; the donor 
     body-weight was applied or removed by a cable-rig. A total of 32 
     scans for each foot were acquired and segmented. Bone kinematics was 
     expressed in terms of anatomical reference systems optimized for the 
     foot kinematic description. Results agree with previous literature 
     where available. However, our analysis reveals that bones such as 
     calcaneus, navicular, intermediate cuneiform, fourth and fifth 
     metatarsal move more during foot pronation than flexion. 
     Weightbearing significantly increase the range of motion of almost 
     all the bone. Cuneiform and metatarsal move more due to weightbearing 
     than in response to ground inclination, showing their role in the 
     load-acceptance phase. The data here reported represent a step toward 
     a deeper understanding of the foot behavior, that may help in the 
     definition of better treatment and medical devices, as well as new 
     biomechanical model of the foot.]

     AB: Abstract. Squatting is a common daily activity and fundamental 
     exercise in resistance training and closed kinetic chain programs. 
     The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an 
     experimentally induced weakness of the gluteal muscles on joint 
     kinematics, reactions forces (JRFs), and dynamic balance performance 
     during deep bilateral squats in healthy young adults. Ten healthy 
     adults received sequential blocks of (1) branch of the superior 
     gluteal nerve to the tensor fasciae latae (SGNtfl) muscle, (2) 
     superior gluteal nerve (SGN), and (3) inferior gluteal nerve (IGN) on 
     the dominant right leg. At the control condition and following each 
     block, the participants were instructed to perform deep bilateral 
     squats standing on two force plates. Hip, knee, ankle, and pelvis 
     kinematics did not differ significantly following iatrogenic weakness 
     of gluteal muscles. The most important finding was the significant 
     differences in JRFs following SGN and IGN block, with the affected 
     hip, patellofemoral, and ankle joint demonstrating lower JRFs, 
     whereas the contralateral joints demonstrated significantly higher 
     JRFs, especially the patellofemoral joint which demonstrated an 
     average maximum difference of 1.43 x body weight compared with the 
     control condition. When performing a deep bilateral leg squat under 
     SGN and IGN block, the subjects demonstrated an increased center of 
     pressure (CoP) range and standard deviation (SD) in mediolateral 
     compared with the control condition. These results imply that squat 
     performance changes significantly following weakness of gluteal 
     muscles and should be considered when assessing and training athletes 
     or patients with these injuries.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Hamstring strain injury (HSI) remains a 
     performance, economic, and player availability burden in sport. 
     High-speed running (HSR) is cited as a common mechanism for HSI. 
     While evidence exists regarding the high physical demands on the 
     hamstring muscles in HSR, meta-analytical synthesis of related 
     activation and kinetic variables is lacking. Methods. A systematic 
     search of Medline, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, SportDiscus, and Cochrane 
     library databases was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 
     guidelines. Studies reporting hamstring activation (electromyographic 
     [EMG]) or hamstring muscle/related joint kinetics were included where 
     healthy adult participants ran at or beyond 60% of maximum speed 
     (activation studies) or 4 m per second (m/s) (kinetic studies). 
     Results. A total of 96 studies met the inclusion criteria. Run 
     intensities were categorized as "slow," "moderate," or "fast" in both 
     activation and kinetic based studies with appropriate relative, and 
     raw measures, respectively. Meta-analysis revealed pooled mean 
     lateral hamstring muscle activation levels of 108.1% (95% CI: 
     84.4%-131.7%) of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) 
     during "fast" running. Meta-analysis found swing phase peak knee 
     flexion internal moment and power at 2.2 Newton meters/kilogram 
     (Nm/kg) (95% CI: 1.9-2.5) and 40.3 Watts/kilogram (W/kg) (95% CI: 
     31.4-49.2), respectively. Hip extension peak moment and power was

     AB: Abstract. Studies examining the effect of protein (PRO) feeding 
     on post resistance exercise (RE) muscle protein synthesis (MPS) have 
     primarily been performed in men, and little evidence is available 
     regarding the quantity of PRO required to maximally stimulate MPS in 
     trained women following repeated bouts of RE. We therefore quantified 
     acute (4 h and 8 h) and extended (24 h) effects of two bouts of 
     resistance exercise, alongside protein-feeding, in women, and the PRO 
     requirement to maximize MPS. Twenty-four RE trained women (26.6 ± 0.7 
     years, mean ± SEM) performed two bouts of whole-body RE (3 × 8 
     repetitions/maneuver at 75% 1-repetition maximum) 4 h apart, with 
     post-exercise ingestion of 15 g, 30 g, or 60 g whey PRO (n = 
     8/group). Saliva, venous blood, and a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy 
     were taken at 0 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h post-exercise. Plasma leucine 
     and branched chain amino acids were quantified using gas 
     chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after ingestion of D2O. 
     Fifteen grams PRO did not alter plasma leucine concentration or 
     myofibrillar synthetic rate (MyoFSR). Thirty and sixty grams PRO 
     increased plasma leucine concentration above baseline (105.5 ± 5.3 
     μM; 120.2 ± 7.4 μM, respectively) at 4 h (151.5 ± 8.2 μM, p < 0.01; 
     224.8 ± 16.0 μM, p < 0.001, respectively) and 8 h (176.0 ± 7.3 μM, p 
     < 0.001; 281.7 ± 21.6 μM, p < 0.001, respectively). Ingestion of 30 g 
     PRO increased MyoFSR above baseline (0.068 ± 0.005%/h) from 0 to 4 h 
     (0.140 ± 0.021%/h, p < 0.05), 0 to 8 h (0.121 ± 0.012%/h, p < 0.001), 
     and 0 to 24 h (0.099 ± 0.011%/h, p < 0.01). Ingestion of 60 g PRO 
     increased MyoFSR above baseline (0.063 ± 0.003%/h) from 0 to 4 h 
     (0.109 ± 0.011%/h, p < 0.01), 0 to 8 h (0.093 ± 0.008%/h, p < 0.01), 
     and 0 to 24 h (0.086 ± 0.006%/h, p < 0.01). Post-exercise ingestion 
     of 30 g or 60 g PRO, but not 15 g, acutely increased MyoFSR following 
     two consecutive bouts of RE and extended the anabolic window over 24 
     h. There was no difference between the 30 g and 60 g responses.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. Exaggerated exercise blood pressure (BP) is 
     independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. 
     However, it is unknown how individual CVD risk factors may interact 
     with one another to influence exercise BP. The aim of this study was 
     to quantify direct and indirect associations between CVD risk factors 
     and exercise BP, to determine what CVD risk factor/s most-strongly 
     relate to exercise BP. Methods. In a cross-sectional design, 660 
     participants (44 ± 2.6 years, 54% male) from the population-based 
     Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study had BP measured during 
     low-intensity fixed-workload cycling. CVD risk factors were measured, 
     including body composition, clinic (rest) BP, blood biomarkers, and 
     cardiorespiratory fitness. Associations between CVD risk factors and 
     exercise BP were assessed using linear regression, with direct and 
     indirect pathways of association assessed via structural equation 
     model. Results. Sex, waist-to-hip ratio, fitness, and clinic BP were 
     independently associated with exercise systolic BP (SBP), and along 
     with age, had direct associations with exercise SBP (p < 0.05 all). 
     Most CVD risk factors were indirectly associated with exercise SBP 
     via a relation with clinic BP (p < 0.05 all). Clinic BP, waist-to-hip 
     ratio, and fitness were most-strongly associated (direct and indirect 
     association) with exercise SBP (β[95% CI]: 9.35 [8.04, 10.67], 4.91 
     [2.56, 7.26], and −2.88 [−4.25, −1.51] mm Hg/SD, respectively). 
     Conclusion. Many CVD risk factors are associated with exercise BP, 
     mostly with indirect effects via clinic BP. Clinic BP, body 
     composition, and fitness were most-strongly associated with exercise 
     BP. These results may elucidate how lifestyle modification could be a 
     primary strategy to decrease exaggerated exercise BP-related CVD 
     risk.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Tibial stress injuries are a burdensome 
     injury among military recruits. Military activities include running 
     and the carriage of additional weight, and this may be related to the 
     high risk of bone stress injuries. The aim of this study was to 
     quantify tibial loading when running at two different speeds, with 
     and without additional weight, and to quantify their combined 
     influence. Methods. Fourteen male distance runners who ran at least 
     40 km per week ran barefoot on a force-instrumented treadmill in four 
     conditions representing preferred running speed (mean (SD) 3.1 (0.3) 
     m/s) and 20% increased running speed (3.8 (0.4) m/s), with and 
     without 20% of body weight carried in a weight vest. Kinematics and 
     kinetics were synchronously collected. Bending moments were estimated 
     about the medial-lateral axis of the tibial centroid located 1/3rd of 
     the length from distal to proximal. Static equilibrium was ensured at 
     each 1% of stance. Peak bending moments were obtained in addition to 
     cumulative-weighted loading, where weighted loading accounted for the 
     relative importance of the magnitude of the bending moment and the 
     quantity of loading using a bone-dependent weighting factor. Results. 
     There were no interaction effects for running speed and weight 
     carriage on peak or cumulative tibial loading. Running at a 20% 
     faster speed increased peak and cumulative loading per kilometer by 
     8.0% (p < 0.001) and 4.8% (p < 0.001), respectively. Carriage of an 
     additional 20% of body weight increased peak and cumulative loading 
     per kilometer by 6.6% (p < 0.001) and 8.5% (p < 0.001), respectively. 
     Interpretation. Increasing the physical demand of running by 
     increasing speed or weight carriage increased peak tibial loading and 
     cumulative tibial loading per kilometer, and this may increase the 
     risk of tibial stress injury. Running speed and weight carriage 
     independently influenced tibial loading.]

     AB: Abstract. The present study compared the ipsilateral repeated 
     bout effect (IL-RBE) and contralateral repeated bout effect (CL-RBE) 
     of the elbow flexors (EF) and knee flexors (KF) for the same interval 
     between bouts to shed light on their mechanisms. Fifty-two healthy 
     sedentary young (20-28 years) men were randomly assigned to the 
     IL-EF, IL-KF, CL-EF, and CL-KF groups (n = 13/group). Thirty maximal 
     eccentric contractions of the EF were performed in IL-EF and CL-EF, 
     and 60 maximal eccentric contractions of the KF were performed in 
     IL-KF and CL-KF, with a 2-week interval between bouts. Changes in 
     muscle damage markers such as maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) 
     torque, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity, and 
     proprioception measures before to 5 days post-exercise were compared 
     between groups. Changes in all variables were greater (p < 0.05) 
     after the first than second bout for all groups, and the changes were 
     greater (p < 0.05) for the EF than KF. The changes in all variables 
     after the second bout were greater (p < 0.05) for the CL than IL 
     condition for both EF and KF. The magnitude of the average protective 
     effect was similar between CL-EF (33%) and CL-KF (32%), but slightly 
     greater (p < 0.05) for IL-EF (67%) than IL-KF (61%). These 
     demonstrate that the magnitude of CL-RBE relative to IL-RBE was 
     similar between the EF and KF (approximately 50%), regardless of the 
     greater muscle damage for the EF than KF. It appears that the CL-RBE 
     is more associated with neural adaptations at cerebrum, cerebellum, 
     interhemispheric inhibition, and coricospinal tract, but the IL-RBE 
     is induced by additional adaptations at muscles.]

     AB: Abstract. Rehabilitation clinicians strive to encourage 
     children's sustained effort within challenging practice conditions. 
     Effort influences intervention success, yet it is rarely defined or 
     measured. Effort can be conflated with individual factors, such as 
     motivation and engagement, that might influence it. Contextual 
     factors that likely impact children's effort, such as practice 
     conditions and therapeutic interactions, are generally 
     under-described. Defining, describing, and measuring effort and its 
     influencers is necessary to enhance understanding of differences in 
     rehabilitation intervention outcomes across individuals and contexts 
     and to support the development of personalized precision 
     rehabilitation approaches. This narrative review describes effort 
     conceptualization in rehabilitation, particularly in relation to 
     intensity, engagement, and participation nomenclature. The review 
     outlines individual and contextual factors that may influence 
     children's effort in rehabilitation and describes potential next 
     steps for effort description and measurement. Subsequent work should 
     aim to identify factors that can be targeted in clinical practice to 
     promote and sustain children's effort in the rehabilitation process, 
     thereby individualizing interventions and potentially improving their 
     effectiveness.]

     orthoses and footwear combinations with individualized alignment and 
     footwear designs (AFO-FC/IAFD) would be more effective than 
     designed-to-be-rigid AFO with non-individualized alignment and 
     footwear designs (AFO-FC/NAFD) in children with cerebral palsy (CP). 
     Method. Nineteen children with bilateral spastic CP were randomized 
     to AFO-FC/NAFD (n = 10) or AFO-FC/IAFD (n = 9) groups. Fifteen were 
     male, average age 6 years 11 months (range 4 years 2 months-9 years 
     11 months), classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System 
     levels II (n = 15) and III (n = 4). The Pediatric Balance Scale 
     (PBS), Gait Outcomes Assessment List (GOAL), Patient-Reported 
     Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), and Orthotic and 
     Prosthetic Users' Survey (OPUS) measures of satisfaction were 
     collected at baseline and after 3 months' wear. Results. Compared 
     with the AFO-FC/NAFD group, those with AFO-FC/IAFD demonstrated 
     greater change in PBS total scores (mean 12.8 [standard deviation 
     10.5] vs 3.5 [5.8]; p = 0.03) and GOAL total scores (3.5 [5.8] vs 
     −0.44 [5.5]; p = 0.03). There were no significant changes in OPUS or 
     PROMIS scores. Interpretation. After 3 months, individualized 
     orthosis alignment and footwear designs had a greater positive effect 
     on balance and parent-reported mobility than a non-individualized 
     approach. No effect was documented for the PROMIS and OPUS. Results

     questionnaire for item, domain, total score, and goal importance in 
     children with cerebral palsy (CP) functioning in Gross Motor Function 
     Classification System (GMFCS) levels I to III. Method. The GOAL 
     questionnaire was completed twice, 3 to 31 days apart, in a 
     prospective cohort study of 112 caregivers of children aged 4 to 17 
     years with CP (40% unilateral; GMFCS level I = 53; II = 35; III = 24; 
     76 males). All had an outpatient visit over a 1-year period. The 
     standard error of measurement (SEM), minimum detectable change, and 
     agreement were calculated for all responses, including goal 
     importance. Results. The SEM for the total score was 3.1 points for 
     the cohort (GMFCS level I = 2.3, GMFCS level II = 3.8, GMFCS level 
     III = 3.6). The standardized domain and item scores were less 
     reliable than the total score and varied according to GMFCS level. 
     The gait function and mobility domain exhibited the best reliability 
     for the cohort (SEM = 4.4), whereas the use of braces and mobility 
     aids domain exhibited the lowest (SEM = 11.9). Goal importance was 
     reliable (cohort average agreement 73%). Interpretation. The parent 
     version of GOAL has acceptable levels of test-retest reliability for 
     most domains and items. Caution is advised when interpreting the 
     least reliable scores. Essential information necessary for accurate 
     interpretation is provided.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. To evaluate the factor structure of the 49 goal 
     prioritization questions of the Gait Outcome Assessment List (GOAL). 
     Method. This was a retrospective review of 622 consecutive 
     individuals diagnosed with cerebral palsy (median = 11 years 2 
     months, SD = 6 years 0 months, 370 male), who underwent a routine 
     clinical gait analysis at a specialty center and completed the 
     validated GOAL. To assess dimensionality, we performed exploratory 
     and confirmatory factor analyses on the goal ratings of its 49 
     gait-related items. For internal consistency, we calculated 
     Cronbach's alpha. We created standardized goal scores for each factor 
     and determined floor and ceiling effects according to the Gross Motor 
     Function Classification System (GMFCS). Results. Factor analyses 
     suggested that the GOAL's 49 goal prioritization items represented 
     eight factors, one more than the original GOAL validation because 
     pain and fatigue were separated into distinct factors. Cronbach 
     alphas were acceptably high (≥0.80) across factors except for use of 
     braces and mobility aids (α = 0.68). Goal importance varied across 
     domains and GMFCS levels. Interpretation. The GOAL can be expanded as 
     a tool to better understand goal priorities in ambulatory individuals 
     with cerebral palsy. These scores can be used to guide clinical 
     conversations and provide more focus than previously available when 
     faced with 49 individual goals. Scores can also be aggregated across 
     relevant populations for larger-scale studies.]

     measuring grip strength and its association with anthropometrics and 
     diseases among adolescents and adults (≥16 years old) with cerebral 
     palsy (CP). Method. In this cross-sectional study, individuals with 
     CP, classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System 
     (GMFCS)/Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) levels I to V, 
     were recruited to measure grip strength, anthropometrics, and 
     self-reported current/history of disease during a routine clinical 
     visit. Feasibility was determined as the proportion 
     recruited/consented/completed testing. Test-retest reliability of 
     three maximal effort trials per side was assessed. Linear regression 
     determined associations of grip strength with anthropometrics after 
     adjusting for age, sex, and GMFCS. The predictive ability of GMFCS 
     alone, grip strength alone, GMFCS + grip strength, and GMFCS × grip 
     strength for diseases was compared. Results. Of 114 individuals 
     approached, 112 participated and 111 successfully completed all 
     tasks. There was good to excellent reliability of test-retest grip 
     strength between trials for dominant and non-dominant sides for the 
     entire cohort and when stratified by each GMFCS and MACS level 
     (intraclass correlation coefficient range 0.83-0.97). Sex, GMFCS, 
     MACS, body mass, and waist circumference were associated with grip 
     strength (p < 0.05), but not hip circumference, waist:hip ratio, or 
     triceps skinfold thickness. Modeling grip strength with GMFCS had a 
     higher predictive value for relevant diseases than GMFCS alone. 
     Interpretation. Grip strength is a feasible and reliable measurement 
     for CP, and is associated with some demographics and anthropometric 
     measures. Grip strength, in addition to the GMFCS, enhanced 
     prediction of disease outcomes.]

     a subscale of the Focus on the Outcomes of Communication Under Six-34 
     (FOCUS-34). Linear mixed models were used to determine developmental 
     trajectories, which were compared with norm and reference data. 
     Potential determinants, for example intellectual functions, speech 
     production, functional communication level (classified with the 
     Communication Function Classification System, CFCS), and functional 
     mobility, were added to assess their effects. Results. Children with 
     cerebral palsy (n = 188; mean age 59 months, range 17-110) were 
     monitored for 2 years 6 months. Developmental trajectories for SLC 
     (C-BiLLT) and SWC (PPVT-III-NL) were nonlinear; those for functional 
     communication (FOCUS-34) were linear. Compared with norm and 
     reference groups, significantly delayed SLC, SWC, and functional 
     communication development were found. Determinants for SLC and SWC 
     were intellectual functions and functional communication level 
     (CFCS); and for functional communication development (FOCUS-34), 
     speech production and arm-hand functioning. Interpretation. Children 
     with cerebral palsy showed delayed SLC, SWC, and functional 
     communication development compared with norm and reference groups. 
     Remarkably, functional mobility was not associated with the 
     development of SLC, SWC, or functional communication.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Ball possessions and game rhythm are 
     promising variables to better understand teams' collective behaviour 
     during a basketball game. However, the role of these variables is not 
     well documented in teams with intellectual impairments (II). This 
     study aimed to explore ball possession and game rhythm differences 
     between II and non-II basketball games. Methods. Data were obtained 
     through video observations (53 II games) and the International 
     Basketball Federation records (53 non-II games). Results. Independent 
     t-tests (P ≤ 0.05) revealed that the number of ball possessions was 
     higher and game rhythm was faster in II games. Two-way 
     repeated-measures analysis of variance (P ≤ 0.05) showed that ball 
     possessions and game rhythm developed differently throughout the II 
     games compared with the non-II games. Conclusions. The differences 
     may be due to the decision-making, tactical and self-regulatory 
     limitations of players with II. These limitations adequately explain 
     why players with II respond differently to the environmental cues and 
     monitor insufficiently their actions compared with players without 
     II. Additionally, the higher number of ball possessions and the 
     faster game rhythm in II games could be an indicator of more 
     intuitive, and thus faster, game-related decision-making. In 
     conclusion, the study provides further understanding of the role of 
     cognition in basketball and contributes to better explain the 
     differences between II and non-II games.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Skills such as planning and problem solving 
     that are required in self-determination can be cognitively demanding. 
     It has not yet been examined whether executive functions and 
     intelligence are associated with levels of self-determination in 
     individuals with intellectual disability (ID), and how that is 
     related to quality of life (QoL). This study examined the 
     associations among executive functions, intelligence, 
     self-determination, and QoL in adolescents with ID. Methods. 
     Seventy-nine adolescents aged between 17 and 20 years with mild ID 
     participated in the study. Executive functions were assessed by 
     experimental tasks. Non-verbal IQ and survey data regarding QoL and 
     self-determination capacity were collected from the participants. 
     Results. In a regression model with QoL as the dependent variable, 
     only executive planning and self-determination capacity (but not 
     working memory, inhibition and IQ) were significant predictors of 
     QoL. Two mediation models were tested based on the hypotheses, 
     literature and current findings. Model 1 revealed that executive 
     planning had a negative direct effect on QoL when the mediator, 
     self-determination capacity, was held constant. Model 2 indicated 
     that the significant association between self-determination and QoL 
     was not mediated by executive planning. Conclusions. The findings 
     highlighted the crucial significance of self-determination, in 
     comparison with executive functions and intelligence, for improving 
     the QoL in adolescents with ID. Importantly, higher executive 
     planning skill was even associated with lower QoL if 
     self-determination was not concurrently strengthened. These findings 
     carry implications for the design of education and intervention 
     programmes aimed at improving QoL of adolescents with ID.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. In adults with an intellectual disability, 
     health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is often measured by proxy 
     report. This cross-sectional study investigated whether the mental 
     health of proxy raters impacts the way they rate HRQoL. Methods. In 
     this study, 110 carers of adults with an intellectual disability 
     completed measures of psychological distress (Kessler-6) and HRQoL 
     (EQ-5D-3L) about their own HRQoL and that of the care recipient. 
     Differences between HRQoL scores as rated by the carer about 
     themselves and the care recipient were calculated (convergence 
     scores) and multiple regression models were fitted to estimate the 
     association between proxy psychological distress and convergence 
     scores for subjective/objective HRQoL controlling for support needs 
     of the care recipient, carer age and gender of care recipient. 
     Results. There was a significant association between psychological 
     distress and subjective HRQoL convergence scores (r = .92; P = 0.03; 
     95%; CI: −1.76 to −0.09). There was no association between 
     psychological distress and objective HRQoL convergence scores (r = 
     .01; CI −0.02 to 0.001; P = 0.08). The association between 
     psychological distress and HRQoL scores was no longer present when 
     models did not include convergence scores. Conclusions. Carers 
     experiencing more psychological distress tended to rate their own and 
     the care recipients' subjective HRQoL more similarly. Objective: 
     HRQoL measures did not show this convergence in scores with 
     increasing carer psychological distress. Findings differed when the 
     analysis approach was changed, suggesting the results above require 
     replication in future studies.]

     this study was to assess the psychometric characteristics of the 
     CPADULT. Method. Caregivers (n = 47; 77% female, 23% male) of 
     individuals with severe disabilities who are non-ambulatory completed 
     the questionnaire. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability and 
     construct validity were analysed. Results. Internal consistency was 
     adequate with Cronbach's alpha values from 0.75 to 0.95. Test-retest 
     reliability was good, as intraclass correlation coefficient of the 
     total score was 0.84 (domains: 0.61-0.89). Construct validity was 
     confirmed with significant differences between subgroups of motor or

     AB: Abstract. The aim of this article is to present explicit and 
     implicit attitudes of occupational therapy (OT) staff towards people 
     with intellectual disabilities. The study was conducted on a group of 
     77 OT employees. To explore the explicit attitude, the Conditional 
     Respect for Persons with Disabilities Questionnaire (Kurtek, Roczniki 
     Psychologiczne, 2018, 4, 327-344) was used, while to estimate the 
     implicit attitude, the Intellectual Disability Attitudes Implicit 
     Association Test was applied (Kurtek, Roczniki Psychologiczne, 2021, 
     1, 43-64). At the explicit level, OT staff tended to tolerate 
     negative and overrate positive behaviours of people with intellectual 
     disabilities, which indicates a tendency to favour the individuals. 
     However, the opposite devalorizing tendency was observed at the 
     implicit dimension, which indicates aversive ableism. Although the 
     study confirmed the independence of the two dimensions of the 
     personnel's attitude, relationships were observed between the 
     disclosure of negativity towards antagonistic behaviours of the 
     people with intellectual disabilities and a decrease in the level of 
     their implicit devaluation.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Narratives are enriched by taking the 
     perspective of the protagonists, which can be expressed using 
     reported speech. Nevertheless, the use of reported speech is 
     unaddressed internationally among individuals with Down syndrome. 
     Method. Narratives of 28 children and adolescents with Down syndrome 
     were collected using a non-verbal picture book. Occurrence and forms 
     of reported speech were analysed and compared to typically-developing 
     children (TD; n = 33). Results. Participants from both populations 
     use reported speech in their narratives with a comparable proportion. 
     Nevertheless, differences appear concerning forms of direct speech 
     with persons with Down syndrome using more free direct speech than 
     TD-children. Discussion. The results suggest that children and 
     adolescents are able to implement the use of reported speech 
     regardless of their syntactic impairments. Concerning the occurring 
     forms of direct speech, the results might point to cognitive 
     impairments that manifest in limited consideration of the 
     interlocutor's knowledge.]

     aimed to evaluate the factor structure of the English language 
     version of POS when used to measure the quality of life of adults 
     (18+) with intellectual disability in the UK. Materials and Methods. 
     Analysis was conducted on POS data from 310 adults with an 
     intellectual disability. First and second order factor models and 
     multi-level models were used to assess fit. Results. There was poor 
     fit to the data for all tested models. We estimated that 23% of 
     variance in POS scores was accounted for by interviewer cluster. 
     Discussion. This was the first UK-based evaluation of POS and our 
     data did not confirm the factor structure of the POS measure. The 
     identification of systematic variability within the dataset indicates 
     that inter-rater reliability is a potential limitation of the POS

     postoperative outcomes remains poorly characterized. We tested the 
     hypothesis that psychological resilience is associated with lower 
     odds of death or new inability to walk independently and other 
     outcomes at 60 days after hip fracture surgery. Methods. This was a 
     pre-planned secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial 
     comparing spinal versus general anesthesia for hip fracture surgery. 
     We analyzed data on 1360 adults aged 50 years or older who were 
     hospitalized for hip fracture surgery at one of 46 US or Canadian 
     hospitals and provided psychological resilience data preoperatively 
     as measured via the Brief Resilience Scale. Major exclusions were the 
     inability to walk without human assistance before fracture and 
     contraindications to spinal anesthesia. Death or new inability to 
     walk independently at 60 days after surgery was the primary outcome; 
     death or new nursing home residence at 60 days and 60-day mortality 
     were secondary outcomes. Results. Greater psychological resilience 
     was associated with lower odds of death or new inability to walk at

     experience complications after surgery (aOR 0.72; CI 0.55 to 0.94, p 
     = 0.02), but not those who had complications (aOR 1.00; CI 0.59 to 
     1.69, p = 0.99). Psychological resilience was associated with lower 
     odds of 60-day death or new nursing home residence (aOR 0.73; 95% CI 
     0.58 to 0.93; p < 0.001) but not with 60-day mortality (aOR 0.92; 95% 
     CI 0.56 to 1.49; p = 0.73). Conclusions. Psychological resilience is 
     associated with better outcomes for older adults after hip fracture 
     surgery, but largely among those who do not have postoperative 
     complications. Future interventions may focus on improving 
     psychological resilience preoperatively or providing support to 
     patients with lower psychological resilience.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of 
     telehealth, which posed unique challenges for the provision of care 
     to older adults who face numerous barriers to accessing and using 
     technology. To improve older adults' online health-related abilities, 
     the UCSF Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (UCSF-GWEP) 
     partnered with Little Brothers Friends of the Elderly-San Francisco 
     (LBFE-SF) to develop a model telehealth training intervention. 
     Methods. LBFE-SF recruited older adults from their members with wi-fi 
     and paired each one with a new device and volunteer trainer to cover 
     seven lessons and four key tasks (emailing providers, video visits, 
     accessing health information, and using patient portals). Older 
     adults completed surveys to self-assess their skill level after 
     training, and their confidence before, immediately after, and 3 
     months post training. A subset of trainees were also interviewed 
     about their program goals and experiences. UCSF-GWEP conducted 
     statistical analyses of survey data, and coded interview transcripts 
     to identify aspects of the model supportive to learning and success. 
     Results. Of 43 participants, 31 completed training. Their median age 
     was 75; 48% were non-white; 45% had no more than a high school 
     education; and 63% reported yearly income below U.S. $20,000. Three 
     months after completing the program, more than 50% of trainees 
     reported that they needed little or no help performing all four key 
     tasks, and confidence with video visits, online searches, and patient 
     portals showed significant improvement. Additionally, in interviews 
     participants reported improved health, social benefits, and explained 
     that learning was facilitated by self-pacing, repetition, and 
     longitudinal support from volunteer trainers. Conclusions. Older 
     adults with various barriers to learning technology showed online 
     independence and increased confidence with some telehealth tasks 
     after a novel training intervention. Key characteristics of the model 
     included a tablet device, one-on-one longitudinal support from 
     volunteers, comprehensive learning materials, and community-academic 
     partnership.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Kinetic asymmetries during sit-to-stand 
     have been consistently observed early after total knee arthroplasty; 
     however, the longer-term outcomes are less clear. The purpose of this 
     systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the results of 
     studies examining inter-limb kinetic symmetry during sit-to-stand 
     performance among individuals who were at least one-year post 
     unilateral total knee arthroplasty. Methods. PubMed, SPORTDiscus, 
     CINAHL, and Health Source databases were searched. Studies were 
     included if they were published in a peer-reviewed journal, included 
     subjects who had undergone unilateral total knee arthroplasty at 
     least one-year prior, and examined vertical ground reaction forces 
     and/or knee extension moments for the involved and uninvolved limbs 
     during sit-to-stand performance. Data were transformed into a limb 
     symmetry index, which expressed the ratio of the peak forces/moments 
     for the involved limb, relative to the uninvolved limb (1.0 reflects 
     perfect symmetry). These ratios were meta-analyzed using the ratio of 
     means method. Findings. Seven studies were deemed eligible for 
     inclusion. Ground reaction force data was pooled from seven studies 
     and knee extension moment data was pooled from two studies. For the 
     peak vertical ground reaction forces, the pooled limb symmetry index 
     was 0.96 (CI95% = [0.93, 0.99]). For the peak knee extension moments, 
     the pooled limb symmetry index was 0.91 (CI95% = [0.84, 0.98]). In 
     both cases this reflects greater limb/knee loading for the uninvolved 
     limb, relative to the involved limb. Interpretation. Asymmetries in 
     limb/knee loading persist beyond the one-year post-operative period 
     following total knee arthroplasty, potentially contributing to 
     degenerative changes for the uninvolved limb.]

     common complication after breast cancer treatment.This study examined 
     isokinetic proprioception, muscular strength, and endurance by 
     comparing extremity with lymphedema and the extremity without 
     lymphedema in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema. Methods. A 
     total of 15 individuals aged between 35 and 70 years participated in 
     this study. Cybex Humac NORM Isokinetic dynamometer (CSMi, Stoughton, 
     MA) were used to assess upper extremity passive proprioception, 
     active proprioception, kinesthesia, muscle strength, and muscle 
     endurance. The upper extremity lymphedema was measured with the water 
     displacement arm volumetry test using a volumeter. Findings. All 
     isokinetic measurements demonstrated a statistically significant 
     difference between the extremity with lymphedema and the extremity 
     without lymphedema, suggesting lower scores in the extremity with 
     lymphedema (p < .05). There was a positive correlation between 
     passive internal rotation in the extremity with lymphedema and the 
     time after mastectomy (r= 0.628, p = .012) and a moderate positive 
     relationship was found between the time after lymphedema and passive 
     internal rotation (r = 0.577; p = .024), and active external rotation 
     position sense (r = 0.540; p = .038) in the extremity with 
     lymphedema. Also, a unidirectional positive moderate (r = 0.594; p = 
     .020) relationship was found between the lymphedema stage and passive 
     external rotation in the extremity with lymphedema. Interpretation. 
     The difference in proprioception, muscle strength, and endurance 
     between the extremity with lymphedema and the extremity without 
     lymphedema in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema will 
     provide valuable information in terms of prioritizing these 
     parameters in treatment.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. People with knee osteoarthritis walk with 
     excessive muscle co-contraction that can accelerate disease 
     progression. Central pain sensitization is common in people with knee 
     osteoarthritis and may be related to walking patterns. The objective 
     of this study was to examine the relation of central pain 
     sensitization with muscle co-contraction during walking in people 
     with knee osteoarthritis. Methods. This study reports secondary 
     analysis from baseline data of two clinical trials (n = 90 
     participants with knee osteoarthritis). The presence of central pain 
     sensitization was measured by mechanical temporal summation at the 
     patella and the wrist. Quadriceps and hamstrings activation was 
     assessed using surface electromyography during walking at 
     self-selected and fast paces. Muscle co-contraction indices for 
     vastus medialis-medial hamstrings and vastus lateralis-lateral 
     hamstrings muscle pairs were calculated during stance phases. 
     Co-contraction outcomes were compared between people with and without 
     mechanical temporal summation at each site, adjusting for age, sex, 
     and body mass index. Findings. People with mechanical temporal 
     summation at the knee had greater vastus lateralis-lateral hamstrings 
     co-contraction while walking at a fast pace (P = 0.04). None of the 
     other differences was statistically significant, but the overall 
     trends and effect sizes indicated greater co-contraction in people 
     with temporal summation at the knee irrespective of gait phase, 
     walking speed, or muscle pairs. Interpretation. Central pain 
     sensitization, assessed as mechanical temporal summation at the knee, 
     is related to greater knee muscle co-contraction during fast walking 
     in people with knee osteoarthritis. Thus, mitigating central 
     sensitization may be an interventional target to reduce muscle 
     co-contraction for people with knee osteoarthritis.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Alterations in vibration perception among 
     children and adolescents with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease might 
     explain observed changes in foot posture. Therefore, this 
     cross-sectional study compared the vibration perception of the lower 
     limbs in youths with and without Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and 
     verified the cut-off value of the distal vibration perception for the 
     Charcot-Marie-Tooth group. In addition, associations between dynamic 
     plantar pressure, vibration perception and isometric muscle strength 
     were investigated. Methods. Participants aged 9-18 
     (Charcot-Marie-Tooth group n = 32; Typical group n = 32) had 
     vibration perception measured by a 128-Hz graduated tuning fork. The 
     static and dynamic foot posture were evaluated by the Foot Posture 
     Index and pressure distribution measuring system, respectively. For 
     the Charcot-Marie-Tooth group, a hand-held dynamometer evaluated the 
     isometric muscle strength of the lower limbs. Findings. Children with 
     Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease presented impaired vibration perception 
     at the distal phalanx of the hallux and head of the first metatarsal 
     compared to their typically developing peers, while adolescents with 
     Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease showed impairment in all the tested 
     regions compared to their typically developing peers. The cut-off 
     value for vibration perception for participants with 
     Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease was 5.7, considering the original grade 
     of the tuning-fork 128 Hz. Among the associations established for the 
     Charcot-Marie-Tooth group, a greater vibration perception at the 
     distal phalanx of the hallux was associated with a longer rearfoot 
     contact time (β = 31.02, p = 0.04). Interpretation. These new 
     findings may guide the clinical evaluation and rehabilitation 
     treatment for children and adolescents with Charcot-Marie-Tooth

     AB: Abstract. Background. Restoring the ability to walk with a 
     prosthesis is considered a fundamental rehabilitation goal after 
     transfemoral amputation. An essential prerequisite for achieving this 
     goal is adequate force transmission between the prosthesis and the 
     body. Does bone anchorage of an artificial limb permit a more normal 
     force transmission? Methods. Data of 15 healthy subjects, nine 
     amputees fitted with bone-anchored prostheses, nine amputees using 
     socket prostheses, and 18 patients with a total hip replacement were 
     included in this multicenter, observational study. Ground reaction 
     force was measured using Kistler force plates. Kinematics was 
     recorded with 12 Vicon Bonita cameras. Subjects were instructed to 
     walk at three different speeds: first at their self-selected, then at 
     slow, and finally at fast speed. Findings. Self-selected walking 
     speeds of subject groups were significantly different, 
     osseointegrated amputees walked the slowest. The lowest ground 
     reaction force was measured for osseointegrated amputees on the 
     prosthetic side, who also showed the highest force on their 
     contralateral side. Patients with hip replacements showed values 
     similar as healthy subjects. The vertical center of gravity movement 
     was specific for each subject group. Interpretation. The force 
     transmission capacity of the bone-anchored prosthetic leg is limited 
     during walking and is lower than both in socket prostheses users 
     without symptoms and patients with total hip replacement. Therefore, 
     active amputees well fitted with a socket prosthesis who consider a 
     transition to bone-anchorage should be advised that their walking 
     speed may decrease with high probability, and that their 
     self-selected walking speed may even be slower than 3 km/h.]

     and relationship with demographic and disease-related data. Methods. 
     21 Systemic Sclerosis and 19 healthy were included.Berg Balance Scale

     (static, dynamic balance:reaction time and travel time and 
     proprioception), Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire/Health 
     Assessment Questionnaire (health status), Medsger's Disease Severity 
     Scale, Modified Rodnan Skin Score were used in evaluation. Findings. 
     Comparing the groups, there was significant difference in Berg 
     Balance Scale (p:0.036); Health Assessment Questionnaire/Scleroderma 
     Health Assessment Questionnaire (p:0.001); Static balance-center

     (p:0.014) in favor of healthy group.In Systemic Sclerosis, disease 
     severity had moderate correlation with static balance-back 
     (r:-0.504,p:0.020).Skin thickness had low correlation with Reaction 
     Time-front (r:-0.449,p:0.041).Age had low correlation with Travel 
     time-front (r:0.458,p:0.037) and proprioception-left 
     (r:0.450,p:0.041); moderate with Travel time-back (r:0.515;p:0.017) 
     and proprioception-front (r:0.539,p:0.012). Interpretation. Compared 
     to healthy, Systemic Sclerosis had worse health status, functional 
     balance, static/dynamic balance and proprioception.This situation is 
     related to disease severity, skin thickness and age. Evaluations made 
     with objective methods may have the potential to determine the extent 
     of the problem.Clinicians can guide the treatment of patients with 
     SSc by evaluating their static/dynamic balance and 
     proprioception.With early treatment, additional problems that may 
     occur due to worsening of balance and proprioception can be 
     prevented.Proprioception and dynamic balance evaluation can be 
     performed for older patients, static balance when disease activity is 
     high, and dynamic balance when skin thickness score is high.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Spinal orthosis applications are preferred 
     for conservative treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and 
     holistic biomechanical approaches are recommended. Methods. This was 
     single-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled study. It included 
     42 patients (29 females/13 males) aged 10-18 years with adolescent 
     idiopathic scoliosis, Cobb angle of 20°-45°, who were deemed suitable 
     for spinal orthosis use. Patients were randomly divided into two 
     groups: control, spinal orthosis group (n = 21), and insoles and 
     spinal orthosis group (n = 21). All participants used spinal orthoses 
     for 3 months. This study evaluated the functional capacities, quality 
     of life, balance, and plantar pressures of the participants. The 
     evaluations were repeated after 1 week, and 3 months following spinal 
     orthosis application. Findings. Statistically significant difference 
     and positive effect were observed in Cobb angle (p = 0.008; p = 
     0.878, respectively), right total (p = 0.037; p = 0.193, 
     respectively), left total (p = 0.037; p = 0.193, respectively), left 
     rearfoot (p = 0.002; p = 0.708, respectively), and right forefoot 
     plantar pressure (p = 0.001; p = 0.739, respectively) in participants 
     in insoles and spinal orthosis group compared with those in the 
     control group. Statistically significant differences and positive 
     effects were observed in swing length (p = 0.001; p = 0.053, 
     respectively) and functional capacity (p = 0.005; p = 0.220, 
     respectively), which are parameters related to postural balance. No 
     change was found in quality of life of either group (p > 0.05). 
     Interpretation. Insoles may have positive impact on functional 
     capacity, balance, and plantar pressure during long-term follow-up in 
     individuals with scoliosis. Therefore, the evaluation of foot plantar 
     pressure in individuals with scoliosis is recommended, and 
     personalized insoles may be a beneficial option.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Patients suffering from a diabetic foot 
     ulcer often receive a non-weight bearing prescription of the affected 
     limb to promote healing. Total unilalteral offloading of the affected 
     foot necessitates walking aids that require loading at the hands 
     during ambulation. Excessive loading at the hands can increase of the 
     risk of crutch palsy. In addition, certain walking aids can also be 
     more strenuous and less comfortable to use than others, resulting in 
     lower prescription compliance. This study aimed to investigate hand 
     loading, rates of perceived exertion, and usability of typically 
     prescribed walking aids in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. Methods. 
     Twenty patients (12 F | 8 M, 61.0 ± 10.36 yrs. 90.54 ± 13.34 kg, 1.71 
     ± 0.08 m) walked as much as 200 m without assistance and with 
     crutches, walkers, and a wheeled knee walker instrumented with 
     flexible force-sensing pads on walking aid handles. Patients rated 
     exertion using a Modified Borg Scale and completed a System Usability 
     Scale questionnaire after each walking condition with or without 
     walking aids. Findings. Results show that using a wheeled knee walker 
     required 94% less hand loading than crutches and walkers. Patients 
     reported 45% lower exertion with the WKW compared to crutches and 
     walkers, and scored the usability of the wheeled knee walker 106% 
     higher than crutches and walkers. Interpretation. The wheeled knee 
     walker could be the preferred walking aid for total unilateral 
     offloading because of the reduced loading demand at the hands, lower 
     exertion during use, and greater usability compared to crutches and 
     walkers.]

     changes in people with diabetic neuropathy. Methods. Dual-energy CT 
     scans of people with diabetic neuropathy and non-diabetic controls 
     were retrospectively included. Average CT values (in Hounsfield 
     Units) and thickness (in centimeters) of the sub-calcaneal plantar 
     fat pad were measured in mono-energetic images at two energy levels 
     (40 keV and 70 keV). The CT values measured in patients with diabetic 
     neuropathy were correlated to barefoot plantar pressure measurements 
     performed during walking in a clinical setting. Findings. Forty-five 
     dual-energy CT scans of people with diabetic neuropathy and eleven 
     DECT scans of non-diabetic controls were included. Mean sub-calcaneal 
     plantar fat pad thickness did not significantly differ between groups 
     (diabetes group 1.20 ± 0.34 cm vs. control group 1.21 ± 0.28 cm, P = 
     0.585). CT values at both 40 keV (−34.7 ± 48.7 HU vs. −76.0 ± 42.8 
     HU, P = 0.013) and 70 keV (−11.2 ± 30.8 HU vs. -36.3 ± 27.2 HU, P = 
     0.017) were significantly higher in the diabetes group compared to 
     controls, thus contained less fatty tissue. This elevation was most 
     apparent in patients with Type 1 diabetes. CT values positively 
     correlated with the mean peak plantar pressure. Interpretation. 
     Dual-energy CT was able to detect changes in the plantar fat pad of 
     people with diabetic neuropathy.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Lateral intra-articular varus osteotomy is 
     an L-shaped osteotomy of the lateral tibial condyle to correct mild 
     knee valgus and lateral plateau malunion of the proximal tibia. In 
     order to minimize injury, it was modified to preserve the 
     posterolateral cortex and the upper tibiofibular joint. The aim of 
     this study was to evaluate the stability of modified lateral 
     intra-articular varus osteotomy by comparing the biomechanical 
     strength with lateral intra-articular varus osteotomy. Methods. 
     Twenty-four synthetic tibia models were divided into 2 groups based 
     on osteotomy type. Each model was then fixed with 2 commonly used 
     plate systems. Biomechanical tests were conducted to measure 
     parameters including construct stiffness, wedge displacement, and the 
     number of failed specimens, and the results were compared among 
     different groups. Findings. No significant difference was found in 
     construct stiffness among all groups (P > 0.05). There was also no 
     significant difference in wedge displacement among all groups (P > 
     0.05). When an axial load of 1500 N was applied, the number of failed 
     specimens showed no significant difference among all groups (P > 
     0.05). The main failure pattern was additional fracture lines on the 
     lateral tibial plateau. Interpretation. The findings indicate that 
     there was no significant difference in stability between the 2 groups 
     under the tested loading conditions. Furthermore, it appears that 
     preserving the posterolateral cortex may have no impact on 
     biomechanical stability.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. High tibial osteotomy surgery is a widely 
     successful joint-preserving procedure which alters the hip-knee-ankle 
     axis which can delay the progression of osteoarthritis; however, 
     conventional osteotomy surgical procedures do not adequately control 
     the posterior tibial slope. This study aimed to determine the key 
     variables influencing posterior tibial slope during high tibial 
     osteotomy and provide a simple means of implementing the findings 
     during pre-operative planning. Methods. A virtual cohort of 
     twenty-eight proximal tibia geometries of knee osteoarthritis 
     patients was used in the study. Firstly, absolute posterior tibial 
     slope values were contrasted using anatomical and posterior 
     mechanical axis measurement approaches. Secondly, the influence of 
     variables affecting posterior tibial slope change during osteotomy 
     surgery was investigated using 3D preoperative planning surgical 
     simulation and analytical modelling. Findings. There was a poor 
     correlation (R2 = 0.38) between the different clinical measurements 
     of posterior tibial slope; with an average of 7.0 ± 1.3° and 14.8 ± 
     2.2° respectively. An analytical solution for the change in posterior 
     tibial slope was derived based on the hinge axis angle and the 
     osteotomy opening angle. For three different opening angles (6°, 9° 
     and 12°) and seven different hinge axis orientations (−30° to +30°), 
     the results obtained were identical for the analytical model and the 
     3D preoperative planning. Interpretation. This study determined that 
     the key variables affecting posterior tibial slope during high tibial 
     osteotomy are the osteotomy opening angle and the hinge axis 
     orientation. The derived formula provides a simple means of 
     determining the change in posterior tibial slope resulting from a 
     particular surgical approach.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Proximal junctional kyphosis is a common 
     long-term complication in adult spinal deformity surgery that 
     involves long-segment posterior spinal fusion. However, the 
     underlying biomechanical mechanisms of the impact of osteoporosis on 
     proximal junctional kyphosis remain unclear. The present study was to 
     evaluate adjacent segment degeneration and spine mechanical 
     instability in osteoporotic patients who underwent long-segment 
     posterior thoracolumbar fusion. Methods. Finite element models of the 
     thoracolumbar spine T1-L5 with posterior long-segment T8-L5 fusion 
     under different degrees of osteoporosis were constructed to analyze 
     intervertebral disc stress characterization, vertebrae mechanical 
     transfer, and pedicle screw system loads during various motions. 
     Findings. Compared with normal bone mass, the maximum von Mises 
     stresses of T7 and T8 were increased by 20.32%, 22.38%, 44.69%, 4.49% 
     and 29.48%, 17.84%, 40.95%, 3.20% during flexion, extension, lateral 
     bending, and axial rotation in the mild osteoporosis model, and by 
     21.21%, 18.32%, 88.28%, 2.94% and 37.76%, 15.09%, 61.47%, −0.04% in 
     severe osteoporosis model. The peak stresses among T6/T7, T7/T8, and 
     T8/T9 discs were 14.77 MPa, 11.55 MPa, and 2.39 MPa under lateral 
     bending conditions for the severe osteoporosis model, respectively. 
     As the severity of osteoporosis increased, stress levels on SCR8 and 
     SCR9 intensified during various movements. Interpretation. 
     Osteoporosis had an adverse effect on proximal junctional kyphosis. 
     The stress levels in cortical bone, intervertebral discs and screws 
     were increased with bone mass loss, which can easily lead to 
     intervertebral disc degeneration, bone destruction as well as screw 
     pullout. These factors have significantly affected or accelerated the 
     occurrence of proximal junctional kyphosis.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Maintaining normal patellar alignment is 
     important for knee health. Altered activation of individual 
     quadriceps muscles have been found related to patellar alignment. 
     However, the relationships between strength and passive stiffness of 
     the quadriceps and patellar alignment remains unexplored. Methods. 
     Participants aged between 60 and 80 years with activity-induced knee 
     pain were recruited. Knee pain was quantified using an 11-point 
     numeric rating scale. Quadriceps strength was assessed using a Cybex 
     dynamometer and passive stiffness of rectus femoris, vastus 
     lateralis, and vastus medialis were measured by shear-wave ultrasound 
     elastography. Patellar alignments were assessed using MR imaging. 
     Linear regression was used to examine relationships between 
     quadriceps properties and patellar alignments with and without 
     controlling for potential covariates. Findings Ninety-two eligible 
     participants were assessed (71.7% females, age: 65.6 ± 3.8 years; 
     pain scale: 4.6 ± 2.0), most of whom had knee pain during stair 
     climbing (85.9%). We found that 17% of patellar lateral tilt angle 
     could be explained by lower quadriceps strength (adjusted R2 = 0.117; 
     P < 0.001), especially in females (R2 = 0.281; P < 0.001; adjusted R2 
     = 0.211; P < 0.001). In addition, a higher stiffness ratio of vastus 
     lateralis/medialis accounted for 12% of patellar lateral displacement 
     (adjusted R2 = 0.112; P = 0.008). Interpretation. Quadriceps strength 
     and relative stiffness of lateral to medial heads are associated with 
     patellar alignment in older adults with knee pain. It suggests that 
     quadriceps weakness and relatively stiffer lateral quadriceps may be 
     risk factors related to patellar malalignments in the elderly.]

     AB: Abstract. Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is thought 
     to be an influential etiology of myelopathy, as thickened ligamentum 
     flavum causes the stenosis of the vertebral canal, which could 
     subsequently compress the spinal cord. Unfortunately, there was 
     little information available on the effects of cervical OLF on spinal 
     cord compression, such as the relationship between the progression of 
     cervical OLF and nervous system symptoms during dynamic cervical 
     spine activities. In this research, a finite element model of C1-C7 
     including the spinal cord featured by dynamic fluid-structure 
     interaction was reconstructed and utilized to analyze how different 
     types of cervical OLF affect principal strain and stress distribution 
     in spinal cord during spinal activities towards six directions. For 
     patients with cervical OLF, cervical extension induces higher stress 
     within the spinal cord among all directions. From the perspective of 
     biomechanics, extension leads to stress concentration in the lateral 
     corticospinal tracts or the posterior of gray matter. Low energy 
     damage to the spinal cord would be caused by the high and fluctuating 
     stresses during cervical movements to the affected side for patients 
     with unilateral OLF at lower grades.]

     AB: Abstract. The goal of the current investigation is to determine 
     the breast tumor size-dependent MNP (Magnetic nano-particle) dose 
     (mg/cm3) that can induce the required therapeutic effects during 
     magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia (MNH). The investigation is done 
     through the MNH simulations on the tumor models generated from 
     DCE_MRI DICOM images of breast cancer from TCIA ('The Cancer Imaging 
     Archive'). Five tumor models are created from MRI data using 3D 
     slicer software having size range of 3 cm3 to 15 cm3. The FEM-based 
     solver (COMSOL multi-physics) is used to simulate bioheat transfer 
     physics in all five extracted models. Single and multi-point 
     injection strategies have been adopted to induce MNP in tumor 
     tissues. The required MNP dose that may induce necessary therapeutic 
     effects is evaluated by comparing the therapeutic effects produced by 
     constant dose (CD) (5 mg/cm3) and variable reduced dose (RD) (5.5-2.8 
     mg/cm3) methodologies. Results show that for the requisite 
     therapeutic effects, injected MNP doses (mg/cm3) should not remain 
     constant as the size of the tumor increases. In fact, MNP dose 
     (mg/cm3) should be reduced as the size of the tumor increases. 
     Results also show that RD works better with a multi-injection 
     strategy than a single injection of MNP. It has been found that the 
     effective MNP dose (mg/cm3) is reduced by 50 % for the biggest tumor 
     size (15 cm3) using multi-injection MNP delivery with respect to the 
     smallest tumor (3 cm3) selected in this study.]

     patients is a common condition. The main objective of the present 
     study was to investigate the effect of custom-molded insole on the 
     plantar pain of flatfoot Methods. 105 patients (representing 174 
     feet) participated in evaluating a custom-made orthotic insole from 
     June 2018 to March 2019. The height of the navicular tubercle (HNT) 
     and the deflection angle of calcaneus (DAC) in flatfoot patients 
     after using orthotic insoles for 6 months were recorded by X-ray 
     imaging and scanning measurements. Plantar pressure on metatarsals 
     1-5 was measured by using an RSscan system. Results. Without the use 
     of an orthotic insole, mean HNT was 0.99±0.34 cm and mean DAC was 
     20.0 ± 3.78 ° during the bearing weight. After using the insole, mean 
     HNT and DAC values reduced to 0.87±0.30 cm and 14.3 ± 3.45 °, 
     respectively (P < 0.05). Hindfoot plantar pressure did not change 
     significantly (P > 0.05). Furthermore, pressure at metatarsals 1-3 
     decreased by 48.5 %, 45.6 %, and 14.3 %, respectively; that at 
     metatarsals 4-5 increased by 33.3 % and 137.5 %, separately, when 
     using the custom-made insole. Conclusions. Visual analog scale score 
     for plantar pain was significantly reduced. These findings indicate 
     that metatarsal pain of flatfoot patients might be the cause of load 
     imbalance in plantar foot.]

     AB: Abstract. Computer-controlled treadmills are common in many gait 
     labs and offer great potential for conducting perturbation-based 
     postural studies. However, the time-course of these disturbances can 
     be too brief to be controlled manually through product software. Here 
     we present a system that combines a Bertec® split-belt treadmill with 
     custom hardware and software to deliver postural disturbances during 
     standing and record data from multiple sources simultaneously. We 
     used this system to administer to 15 healthy participants an 
     8-session perturbation-based training protocol in which they learned 
     to respond without stepping to progressively larger perturbations. 
     Kinematic, electromyographic, and force data were collected 
     throughout. Motion capture was used to characterize the accuracy and 
     repeatability of the treadmill-delivered perturbations with respect 
     to duration, displacement, and peak velocity. These (observed) data 
     were compared to that expected based on software commands and the 
     known constraints of the treadmill (i.e. 10 Hz operating speed). We 
     found perturbation durations to be as expected. Peak velocities and 
     displacements were slightly higher than expected (average increases 
     were 0.59 cm/s and 1.76 cm, respectively). Because this increase in 
     magnitude was consistent, it did not impede training or affect data 
     analysis. Treadmill behavior was repeatable across 95 % of trials.]

     AB: Abstract. The choice of musculoskeletal (MSK) model is crucial 
     for performing MSK estimations to evaluate muscle demands and joint 
     forces. This study compared two previously published generic MSK 
     models and a modified model to estimate tibiofemoral reaction forces 
     (TFRF) during gait, sit-to-stand, and stand-to-sit. The estimated 
     tibiofemoral reaction forces were compared with an in vivo dataset 
     from six patients using an instrumented knee prosthesis. A 
     correlation and root mean square error (RMSE) in the time-series 
     analysis and relative peak error (RPE) were evaluated. The results 
     showed that the three MSK models were similar in estimating the 
     vertical forces, with a large correlation, and RPE was found around 
     20 % during gait. The RMSE and the RPE indicated that the modified 
     model had lower total and lateral compartment forces errors for 
     sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit, showing the best performance. The 
     shear forces for all tasks and models showed significant errors. 
     Future MSK studies should consider these findings when researching 
     functional tasks. The modified model was found to be more effective 
     in estimating the vertical tibiofemoral joint reaction forces in 
     tasks that impose greater demands on muscle forces and require high 
     knee and hip flexion.]

     Fixed-effects modeling was used to compare changes between pre- and 
     post-interventions and control group. Comparisons between pre- and 
     post-interventions (n = 13 studies) reveals a significant decrease in 
     central PWV [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.263; confidence

     objective. Firstly, it aims at determining whether incorporating blow 
     darts as part of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for 
     people with spinal cord injuries (SCI) is feasible and safe. One 
     secondary objective is to provide information regarding its effects 
     on their respiratory function. Equipment and methods. Fifteen people 
     (ASIA Impairment Scale A-D) were assigned either to a blow darts 
     group (intervention group [IG], n = 8, 44.3 ± 8.0 years), or to a 
     non-blow darts group (control group [CG], n = 7, 48.4 ± 7.2 years). 
     The IG completed a blow darts program based on the performance of 3 
     to 4 one-hour weekly sessions for 17 weeks, as part of their 
     rehabilitation. The CG continued to receive the usual care. 
     Feasibility of the program was recorded. Participants also performed 
     spirometry to determine volumes and pulmonary flows and respiratory 
     muscle strength tests to assess their maximum static mouth pressures. 
     Results. Recruitment and completion rate for the IG were both 100%, 
     whereas adherence to the program stood at 62.5%. After completing the 
     program, neither group experienced significant changes in the 
     variables assessed. However, the IG showed evidence for a possibly 
     beneficial effect in peak expiratory flow (PEF) and maximal 
     inspiratory pressures (MIP), with a large effect size (ηp2 = 0.377 
     and 0.199, respectively). Conclusions. A 17-week blow darts program 
     was a feasible rehabilitation approach in a group of SCI individuals. 
     Further studies with greater statistical power are recommended to 
     determine its impact on respiratory parameters.]

     AB: Summary.Objectives. While resistance exercise increases plasma 
     free fatty acids and mobilizes kinases activity, the direct effect of 
     resistance exercise on skeletal muscle peroxisome 
     proliferator-activated receptors delta (PPARδ) remained unclear. The 
     present study investigated the acute and training effects of 
     resistance exercise on PPARδ protein content and its association with 
     serum lipid profile. Equipment and methods. Seventeen young males (n 
     = 8) and females (n = 9) performed a 10-week progressive resistance 
     exercise-training regimen. Body composition was measured before, at 
     the midpoint, and after the training. Vastus lateralis biopsies were 
     obtained 24 hours before and after the first exercise and 24 hours 
     after the last exercise to assess PPARδ content. Blood samples were 
     collected immediately before and after, and 24 hours after the first 
     and the last exercises. Results. PPARδ content acutely increased 49.1 
     ± 28.7% after exercise when adjusted for body fat percentage, and the 
     increase was inversely proportional to body fat percentage (R = 
     −0.877). The acute change in PPARδ was associated with the initial 
     lean mass (R = 0.789) before training. After training, PPARδ content 
     increased 114.7 ± 31.9% and was inversely associated with resting 
     serum total cholesterol (TC) (R = −0.731) and low-density lipoprotein 
     cholesterol (LDL) (R = −0.746). Ten-week Lean mass gain was 
     associated with greater changes in resting serum TC (R = 0.592), 
     high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (R = 0.616), and LDL (R = 
     0.587). Conclusion. The associations among altered serum lipid 
     profile, lean mass gain, and the increased PPARδ protein content 
     induced by resistance exercise suggest that resistance exercise may 
     alter lipid metabolism and play a role in lean mass gain through 
     PPARδ.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Body weight reduction is often used for 
     addressing lifestyle-related diseases, and for slimming down or 
     improving the competitiveness of athletes. It is known that 
     high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels can be increased 
     by habitual exercise, while low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol 
     (LDL-C) levels may not always be decreased by dietary restriction or 
     exercise. We hypothesized that the levels of not only HDL-C, but also 
     LDL-C improve more with body weight reduction by a combined 
     diet-and-exercise regimen than that by a diet-only regimen. Summary 
     of facts and results. Six healthy young adult male volunteers 
     participated in two 10-day crossover experiments (20 days total). The 
     first 5 days comprised an adjustment period (energy intake, 2521 ± 
     304 kcal/day (mean ± standard deviation)). During the second 5-day 
     period, participants either reduced their energy intake to 1261 ± 152 
     kcal/day, or reduced their energy intake to 1891 ± 228 kcal/day and 
     exercised on a bicycle ergometer to consume 630 ± 76 kcal/day. 
     Decreases in the serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and 
     apolipoprotein (apo) B levels were significantly larger, and 
     decreases in the HDL-C and apo A1 levels were significantly smaller 
     with the diet-and-exercise regimen than with the diet-only regimen. 
     Consequently, the atherosclerosis index (AI: (TC-HDL-C)/HDL-C ratio) 
     was significantly lower, and the degree of its reduction was 
     significantly larger, after the diet-and-exercise regimen than after 
     the diet-only regimen. Conclusion. These results suggest that 
     reducing the body weight by a combination of diet and exercise has 
     more beneficial effects on cholesterol metabolism, including changes 
     in apo levels, than diet alone in healthy young adults.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. This systematic review aimed to analyze the 
     effects of different exercise protocols on physical fitness 
     (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and body composition), 
     quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, and sleep quality in 
     patients with different types of cancer undergoing neoadjuvant 
     treatment. Design. Systematic review. Method. A comprehensive search 
     of existing literature was carried out using four electronic 
     databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library 
     (published until October 19, 2022). All databases were searched for 
     randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental investigations, and 
     pre-post investigations assessing the effects of exercise in cancer 
     patients during neoadjuvant treatment. Excluded articles included 
     multicomponent interventions, such as exercise plus diet or 
     behavioral therapy, and investigations performed during adjuvant 
     treatment or survivorship. The methodological quality of each study 
     was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. 
     Results. Twenty-seven trials involving 999 cancer patients were 
     included in this review. The interventions were conducted in cancer 
     patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment for rectal (n = 11), breast 
     (n = 5), pancreatic (n = 4), esophageal (n = 3), gastro-esophageal (n 
     = 2), and prostate (n = 1) cancers, and leukemia (n = 1). Among the 
     investigations included, 14 utilized combined exercise protocols, 11 
     utilized aerobic exercise, and two utilized both aerobic and 
     resistance training separately. Exercise interventions appeared to 
     improve cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, body composition, 
     and quality of life, although many investigations lacked a 
     between-group analysis. Conclusion. Despite limited evidence, 
     exercise interventions applied during neoadjuvant treatment 
     demonstrate promising potential in enhancing cardiorespiratory 
     fitness, muscle strength, body composition, and overall quality of 
     life. However, a scarcity of evidence remains on the effects of 
     exercise on cancer-related fatigue and sleep quality. Further 
     research with high-quality randomized controlled trials is 
     warranted.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Tendons play a crucial role allowing the 
     storage and release of mechanical energy during the running cycle. 
     Running kinematics, including duty factor, constitute a basic element 
     of the runner's biomechanics, and can determine their performance. 
     This study aimed to analyze the link between Achilles tendon and 
     plantar fascia morphology and running parameters, considering the 
     influence of wearing shoes versus running barefoot. Design. 
     Cross-sectional study. Methods. 44 participants (30 men and 14 women) 
     engaged in two running sessions, one with shoes and one without, both 
     lasting 3 min at a consistent speed of 12 km/h. We captured running 
     kinematic data using a photoelectric cell system throughout the 
     sessions. Before the trials, we measured the thickness and 
     cross-sectional area of both the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia 
     using ultrasound. Results. The Pearson test revealed a significant 
     correlation (p < 0,05) between Achilles tendon and plantar fascia 
     morphology and contact time (r > − 0.325), flight time (r > − 0.325) 
     and duty factor (ratio of ground contact to stride time) (r > − 
     0.328) during barefoot running. During the shod condition, no 
     significant correlation was found between connective tissue 
     morphology and kinematic variables. Conclusions. In barefoot running, 
     greater size of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia results in a 
     reduced duty factor, attributed to longer flight times and shorter 
     contact times.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. To determine the influence of severity and 
     direction (craniocaudal length vs cross-sectional area) of 
     intramuscular tendon tears in the lower limb on return-to-play times, 
     compared to muscle injuries without intramuscular tendon involvement. 
     Design. Systematic review with meta-analysis. Methods. AMED, CINAHL, 
     SPORTDiscus, ScienceDirect, PubMed (MEDLINE) and Web-of-Science were 
     searched from inception to 31st July 2023, retrieving 666 records, of 
     which nine were deemed eligible. A random-effects meta-analysis was 
     performed on time to return-to-play for British Athletics Muscle 
     Injury Classification 'b' vs 'c'. Results. On the Quality in 
     Prognosis Studies tool, one study had low risk of bias and eight had 
     high risk. Using a best-evidence synthesis, no strong evidence 
     emerged for a difference in time to return-to-play between injuries 
     with or without intramuscular tendon involvement. Moderate evidence 
     was found for an association between increased return-to-play time 
     and the presence of "waviness" on magnetic resonance imaging and loss 
     of tendon tension, but no association with longitudinal extent of 
     tendon involvement. Pooled analysis revealed a medium effect-size 
     difference between British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification 'b' 
     and 'c' injuries, favouring classification 'b' (Hedges g = 0.67; 95% 
     confidence interval 0.20 to 1.15; P = 0.002). Conclusions. It remains 
     difficult to provide an accurate prognosis for muscle injuries 
     involving the intramuscular tendon due to high risk of bias and 
     moderate heterogeneity across studies. Moderate evidence favoured the 
     prognosis for injuries at the musculotendinous junction (British 
     Athletics Muscle Injury Classification 'b') over intratendinous 
     injuries (British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification 'c').]

     factors experienced accredited exercise physiologists (AEPs) and 
     medical professionals consider when prescribing/recommending aerobic 
     exercise to patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. 
     Design. Modified Delphi Survey. Methods. A four-round, two-phase 
     survey was conducted. Following a Delphi approach, four 
     cancer-specific AEPs, four oncologists, and one breast cancer surgeon 
     (median 13-yr breast-cancer-specific experience) completed phase one. 
     Eighty-four AEPs (median 5-yr experience) completed phase two. Phase 
     one participants answered open- and close-ended questions regarding 
     key considerations for aerobic exercise in patients with breast 
     cancer undergoing chemotherapy, and what information should be 
     collected to guide exercise prescription. All questions and 
     considerations agreed upon in phase one (> 70 % rating 7-9 on a 0-9 
     Likert Scale) were rated by AEPs in phase two. Results. Key 
     considerations for exercise assessment and prescription aligned 
     closely with exercise guidelines for cancer survivors. Common 
     strategies for exercise individualisation were identified by AEPs, 
     including separating aerobic exercise into 5-to--9-minute bouts when 
     required and avoiding exercising to complete exhaustion. Exercise 
     intensity and duration should be adjusted throughout chemotherapy to 
     improve tolerance and adherence. Novel considerations for subjective 
     questioning and objective assessments to tailor exercise prescription 
     were outlined. Conclusions. This study identifies how professionals 
     approach exercise assessment and prescription in patients with breast 
     cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Findings can guide AEPs in practice 
     when prescribing tailored exercise to breast cancer patients 
     undergoing chemotherapy and inform future guidelines.]

     on the effectiveness of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on 
     health outcomes amongst cancer survivors. Design. Systematic review 
     and meta-analysis. Methods. A systematic search was conducted using 
     databases CINAHL and Medline (via EBSCOhost platform), Scopus, Web of 
     Science Core Collection, and the Cochrane Central Register of 
     Controlled Trials. Randomised, controlled, exercise trials involving 
     cancer survivors were eligible. Data on the effects of HIIT amongst 
     individuals diagnosed with cancer at any stage were included. Risk of 
     bias was assessed with the Mixed. Methods: Appraisal Tool (MMAT). 
     Standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated to compare 
     differences between exercise and usual care. Meta-analyses (including 
     subgroup analyses) were undertaken on the primary outcome of 
     interest, which was aerobic fitness. Secondary outcomes were fatigue, 
     quality of life, physical function, muscle strength, pain, anxiety, 
     depression, upper-body strength, lower-body strength, systolic and 
     diastolic blood pressure. Results. Thirty-five trials from 
     forty-seven publications were included, with intervention durations 
     ranging between 4 and 18 weeks. Breast cancer participants were 
     represented in the highest number of trials (n = 13, 37 %). 
     Significant effects in favour of HIIT exercise for improving aerobic 
     fitness, quality of life, pain and diastolic blood pressure were 
     observed (SMD range: 0.25-0.58, all p < 0.01). Conclusions. 
     Participation in HIIT exercise was associated with higher retention 
     and improvements in aerobic fitness, quality of life, pain and 
     diastolic blood pressure. The present results provide updated 
     contemporary evidence for clinicians (e.g. exercise physiologists and 
     physiotherapists) to prescribe HIIT exercise for cancer survivors to 
     improve health before, during and following treatment.]

     23 (Female = 10; 43.5 %) athletes at medical clearance to 
     play/activity from concussion (CONCUSS) and 23 sex-, age-, and 
     sport-matched healthy athletes (CONTROLS) completed a 5-min seated 
     rest before and after the dynamic exertion test. Independent sample 
     t-tests were used to compare CONCUSS and CONTROLS for completion 
     time, heart rate, and blood pressure; and Mann-Whitney U tests for 
     symptoms, perceived exertion, and errors. A series of ANOVAs were 
     conducted to compare heart rate variability between groups across 
     pre- and post-exercise rest periods. Results. There were no 
     differences in heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, perceived 
     exertion, and errors. CONCUSS were faster on Zig Zag (p = .048) and 
     Pro Agility (p = .018) tasks, reported lower symptom severity (p = 
     .019), and had lower post-EXiT HRV (p < .049) than CONTROLS. 
     Conclusions. Performance, symptoms, perceived exertion, and blood 
     pressure outcomes from dynamic exertion were equivocal between 
     athletes at medical clearance from concussion and healthy controls, 
     which provide empirical support for dynamic exercise to inform 
     medical clearance clinical decision making for sport-related 
     concussion. However, differences in autonomic nervous system 
     functioning indicate that additional research is needed to examine 
     temporal changes in heart rate variability and other physiological 
     outcomes following dynamic exertion.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Previous work shows that linguistic features 
     (e.g. word length, word frequency) impact the predictability of 
     stuttering events. Most of this work has been conducted using reading 
     tasks. Our study examined how linguistic features impact the 
     predictability of stuttering events during spontaneous speech. 
     Methods. The data were sourced from the FluencyBank database and 
     consisted of interviews with 35 adult stutterers (27,009 words). 
     Three logistic regression mixed models were fit as the primary 
     analyses: one model with four features (i.e. initial phoneme, 
     grammatical function, word length, and word position within a 
     sentence), a second model with six features (i.e. the features from 
     the previous model plus word frequency and neighborhood density), and 
     a third model with nine features (i.e. the features from the previous 
     model plus bigram frequency, word concreteness, and typical age of 
     word acquisition). We compared our models using the Area Under the 
     Curve statistic. Results. The four-feature model revealed that 
     initial phoneme, grammatical function, and word length were 
     predictive of stuttering events. The six-feature model revealed that 
     initial phoneme, word length, word frequency, and neighborhood 
     density were predictive of stuttering events. The nine-feature model 
     was not more predictive than the six-feature model. Conclusion. 
     Linguistic features that were previously found to be predictive of 
     stuttering during reading were predictive of stuttering during 
     spontaneous speech. The results indicate the influence of linguistic 
     processes on the predictability of stuttering events such that words 
     associated with increased planning demands (e.g. longer words, low 
     frequency words) were more likely to be stuttered.]

     reliability, and validity in Turkish culture. Methods. The original 
     4S scale was translated into Turkish (4S-TR) using a forward-backward 
     translation technique and was administered to 350 adults who stutter 
     (AWS). To discover latent variables evaluated on the scale, 
     two-factor analyses were performed. Internal consistency and temporal 
     stability were calculated to ensure reliability. Test-retest 
     reliability correlation scores were calculated with multiple 
     applications of the scale within about two weeks. To verify construct 
     validity, participants also completed the Turkish versions of the

     that self-stigma has a significant negative correlation with 
     self-esteem (r = −.41) and life satisfaction (r = −.38) as was 
     predicted. Conclusions. The findings demonstrate preliminary evidence 
     that the 4S-TR is a viable and valid instrument for self-stigma 
     evaluation in three domains (stigma awareness, stereotype agreement, 
     and self-concurrence). The 4S-TR can be applied for research and 
     clinical purposes in Turkish.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Instagram has become a popular platform for 
     sharing and seeking health-related information, including stuttering. 
     However, concerns have been raised about the accuracy, 
     confidentiality, and potential negative impact of such information. 
     This study aims to examine how stuttering is defined and understood 
     on Instagram, and how users engage with related content. Methods. We 
     analyzed highly engaged Instagram posts with the hashtag 
     "#Stuttering" published within a year and their corresponding 
     comments using thematic analysis. Results. The results revealed four 
     main themes and nine sub-themes that highlighted different 
     understandings of stuttering on Instagram, including the need for 
     intervention, emotional impact on people who stutter, positive 
     meanings, and mental health implications. User engagement varied 
     based on the nature of the post, with users showing appreciation, 
     objections, seeking advice, celebrating success stories, mocking, or 
     advocating for people who stutter. Conclusion. Although Instagram can 
     serve as a means of normalizing stuttering and highlighting success 
     stories, it raises concerns about the promotion of non-evidence-based 
     treatments and the use of stuttering for political or entertainment 
     purposes. This study emphasizes the need to critically evaluate 
     health-related information presented on social media platforms. To 
     provide reliable information to PWS and their families who seek 
     information on social media, it is recommended to promote 
     evidence-based information on stuttering through trustworthy 
     organizations such as the National Stuttering Association or the 
     Stuttering Foundation, particularly on special occasions like 
     International Stuttering Awareness Day.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Treatment of school-age children (6-12 
     years of age) who stutter is a public health priority. Their clinical 
     needs include a psychosocial focus and stuttering reduction. For the 
     latter clinical need, there is a critical window of opportunity for 
     these children warranting research attention. Purpose. The purpose of 
     the review is to guide future clinical research by establishing (a) 
     what interventions are associated with stuttering reduction for 
     school-age children (b) the reported immediate and longer-term 
     effects of those interventions, and (c) the level of evidence for 
     these interventions in terms of study design. Methods. Fourteen 
     databases and three conference proceedings were searched for 
     interventions used to reduce stuttering in school-age children. 
     Primary outcomes were mean stuttering reductions pre-treatment, 
     immediately post-treatment, and any follow-up assessments. Results. 
     Of the 4305 studies identified from the databases, 67 studies met 
     inclusion criteria. Five different treatment approaches were reported 
     in the literature that might reduce stuttering for a school-age 
     child, but with varying effect sizes. These include (a) operant 
     methods, (b) speech restructuring, (c) combined operant methods and 
     speech restructuring, (d) machine-driven treatments, and (e) 
     treatments with a cognitive behaviour therapy component. Conclusions. 
     Operant methods warrant investigation in future clinical trial 
     research, as do variants of speech restructuring. Hybrid approaches 
     showed encouraging results, including speech restructuring variants 
     combined with operant methods or with cognitive behaviour therapy. 
     However, evidence is preliminary only at Phase I and II trials. 
     Several treatments with reported clinical promise have been 
     overlooked for decades and require further investigation.]

     considered where a parent of a 3-year-old child asked if a clinician 
     can predict whether their child will recover from stuttering without 
     treatment. Results. A distinguished scholar presented a 5-minute 
     video interpretation of research about this topic. Three master 
     clinicians then each presented a 2-minute video demonstration of how 
     that research might be applied in a clinical situation. Following 
     that, the convenors moderated a discussion between the distinguished 
     scholar, master clinicians, and delegates regarding the research and 
     how it applies to clinical practice.]

     continued the conversation by written dialogue for the purpose of 
     placing it on record. Results. The discussants reached agreement on 
     many points, but there was some diversity of viewpoint about how 
     neurodiversity and ableism should apply to clinical practice with

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. The purpose of the study was to compare 
     school-age children who stutter (CWS) and age-matched children who do 
     not stutter (CWNS) in syntactic abilities and syntactic performance. 
     Methods. Computerized Language Sample Analysis (LSA) was conducted on 
     the conversation samples obtained from 46 school-age CWS and CWNS 
     between 7 and 16 years (CWS, n = 23). Syntactic abilities were 
     assessed using the Index of Productive Syntax (the IPsyn) and 
     Developmental Sentence Scores (DSS) and mixed effects logistic 
     regression analyses with participants as random effects were 
     conducted to determine if the scores were predictive of group 
     membership. Additionally, the groups were compared in the IPsyn 
     subcategories to assess the use of syntactic structures. Syntactic 
     performance was assessed by: (a) Categorizing the sentences from each 
     conversation sample into high vs. low syntactic complexity categories 
     based on DSS scores and comparing the sentence categories in % 
     stuttered sentences (% SS); and (b) Comparing the groups in the 
     proportion of phrase-level disfluencies (phrase repetitions vs. 
     revisions) that are associated with syntactic planning. Results. In 
     terms of syntactic abilities, the IPsyn scores interacted with the 
     number of utterances (sample size) used to compute the scores in 
     predicting group membership. In comparison to the CWNS, the CWS 
     obtained higher scores in the IPsyn and the sentence structure 
     subcategory of the IPsyn that were independent of sample size. In 
     terms of syntactic performance: (a) Significantly more sentences were 
     stuttered in the high compared to the low syntactic sentence 
     category; (b) Compared to the CWNS who demonstrated significantly 
     more phrase revisions, the CWS showed comparable and fewer phrase 
     revisions and repetitions. Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed 
     that the CWS used significantly elaborated noun phrases and a similar 
     trend was evident for verb phrase elaborations. A significant 
     association between verb phrase elaborations and%SS was also 
     obtained. Conclusions. Findings from the IPsyn and the use of 
     elaborate noun phrases, and to some extent verb phrases, suggested 
     that the CWS used more complex syntax even in shorter conversational 
     samples. More stuttered sentences in the high DSS sentence category, 
     the use of fewer phrase revisions, and the association between 
     stuttering and elaborated verb phrases in the CWS are interpreted to 
     suggest the effects of syntactic planning and reformulation demands 
     on fluency during ongoing articulation.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. There is an emerging view that 
     attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is marked by problems 
     with language difficulties, an idea reinforced by the fact that ADHD 
     is highly comorbid with developmental language disorder (DLD). This 
     scoping review provides an overview of literature on language 
     abilities in children with DLD and ADHD while highlighting 
     similarities and differences. Method. A comprehensive search was 
     performed to examine the literature on language abilities in the two 
     disorders, yielding a total of 18 articles that met the inclusion 
     criteria for the present review. Qualitative summaries are provided 
     based on the language domain assessed. Results. The current 
     literature suggests children and adolescents with ADHD have better 
     morphosyntax/grammar, general/core language abilities, receptive, and 
     expressive abilities than those with DLD. Further, that performance 
     is comparable on assessments of semantic and figurative language but 
     varies by sample on assessments of phonological processing, syntax, 
     narrative language, and vocabulary. Conclusion. Evidence presented 
     points to children and adolescents with DLD as having greater 
     language difficulties compared to those with ADHD, but with some 
     important caveats. Despite limitations related to the paucity of 
     studies and inconsistencies in how the two types of disorders are 
     identified, our review provides a necessary and vital step in better 
     understanding the language profiles of these two highly prevalent 
     childhood disorders. These findings are useful in optimizing language 
     outcomes and treatment efficacy for children and adolescents with 
     ADHD and DLD.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. The purpose of the study was to pilot a 
     working memory (WM) - and modified Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) 
     approach to treat word finding deficits in a group of people with 
     aphasia (PwA). Two research questions were posed: 1. Will the group 
     of PwA be able to complete the WM tasks used in the approach? 2. Will 
     the approach improve naming performance in PwA? Method. Three 
     individuals with mild - moderate aphasia participated in this 
     singlesubject multiple baseline treatment design. Pre-treatment 
     assessments of language, and pre- to post-treatment assessments of WM 
     abilities were carried out. The treatment protocol incorporated WM 
     and linguistic tasks in order to improve naming accuracy across two 
     treatment lists. Probes were carried out prior to treatment on each 
     list, and at one-month following completion of treatment. Two outcome 
     measures were obtained: Percent accuracy in completing the WM steps, 
     and treatment effect sizes (Beeson & Robey, 2006). Additionally, 
     modified t-tests (Crawford & Garthwaite, 2012; Crawford & Howell, 
     1998), were calculated in which post-treatment WM measures were 
     compared against neurotypical control groups to detect any 
     improvements in WM functions. Results. All three participants 
     completed the WM steps with a high degree of accuracy. A range of 
     small to large ESs were obtained for all three participants across 
     the two treated lists, while no meaningful ESs were obtained for the 
     control (untreated) list. All three participants demonstrated 
     improved scores across most of the WM measures with significant 
     improvements noted on certain WM assessments. Conclusions. The 
     findings revealed that the WM - SFA approach can be used successfully 
     in individuals with mild - moderate aphasia. The proposed approach 
     holds promise as feasible intervention designed to remediate anomia 
     in PwA.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Autoimmune neurological diseases (ANDs) 
     are a specific type of autoimmune disease that affect cells within 
     the central and peripheral nervous system. ANDs trigger various 
     physical/neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, language impairments in 
     people with ANDs are not well characterized. Here we aimed to 
     determine the kinds of language impairment that most commonly emerge 
     in 10 ANDs, the characteristics of the patients (demographic, 
     neurological damage), and the assessment methods used. Methods. We 
     followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). 
     PubMed and Google Scholar were searched. We used a list of search 
     terms containing 10 types of ANDs (e.g. multiple sclerosis, acute 
     disseminated encephalomyelitis) in combination with the terms 
     aphasia, dysphasia, fluency, language, listening, morphology, 
     phonology, pragmatics, reading, semantics, speaking, syntax, writing. 
     The reference lists and citations of the relevant papers were also 
     investigated. The type of AND, patient characteristics, neurological 
     damage and examination technique, language tests administered, and 
     main findings were noted for each study meeting the inclusion 
     criteria. Results. We found 171 studies meeting our inclusion 
     criteria. These comprised group studies and case studies. Language 
     impairments differed largely among types of ANDs. Neurological 
     findings were mentioned in most of the papers, but specific language 
     tests were rarely used. Conclusions. Language symptoms in people with 
     ANDs are commonly reported. These are often not full descriptions or 
     only focus on specific time points in the course of the disease. 
     Future research needs to assess specific language functions in people 
     with ANDs and relate their language impairments to brain damage at 
     different stages of disease evolution.]

     AB: Abstract. Clinical trials provide Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
     (DMD) patients access to medication. Nevertheless, such involvement 
     can impose certain burdens, as the protocol may entail strict 
     adherence and additional demands. This study assessed the 
     psychosocial functioning and quality of life in boys with DMD and 
     their parents who participate in clinical trials. DMD families 
     participating in clinical trials (n = 25) and families with DMD 
     patients not involved in clinical trials (N = 18) were included. 
     Questionnaires assessing psychosocial well-being and quality of life 
     were completed by the participants and their parents. MANOVAs were 
     employed to compare outcomes between groups. The results showed that 
     mothers in the clinical trial group experienced significantly higher 
     scores of somatic complaints. Fathers in the clinical trial group 
     reported significantly fewer psychological issues compared to fathers 
     from the other group. DMD patients participating in clinical trials 
     reported a better overall and emotional quality of life compared to 
     them not involved in clinical trials. This study suggests that 
     clinical trial participation may have positive effects on quality of 
     life and psychosocial outcomes. It highlights the importance of 
     providing support and counseling throughout the clinical trial 
     decision making process to minimize potential burden for both

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Psychological interventions for advanced 
     cancer patients are effective in decreasing distress but are not well 
     integrated into cancer care. Oncology nurses are well positioned to 
     deliver such interventions, and their participation may enhance 
     professional satisfaction and wellbeing. Managing Cancer and Living 
     Meaningfully (CALM) is an evidence-based psychotherapy supporting 
     advanced cancer patients. A CALM-Nurses (CALM-N) training program was 
     developed to teach oncology nurses the basics of CALM for use in 
     daily practice. Feasibility and acceptability of CALM-N and its 
     impact on professional wellbeing were assessed in this pilot study. 
     Data Sources. Fifty-five nurses attended CALM-N in three groups. 
     Thirty-five nurses completed the first e-learning, 29 nurses (83%) 
     attended the first group session, and 22 (63%) attended all sessions. 
     At baseline, 35 questionnaires were collected. Response rate at 
     follow-up was 63% for Jefferson Scale of Empathy (n=22), 66% for 
     self-efficacy scale (n=23), and for subscales of Professional Quality 
     of Life Scale burnout; 51% (n=18), secondary traumatic stress; 49% 
     (n=17), compassion satisfaction; 57% (n=20). A statistically 
     significant increase in self-efficacy was found, but there were no 
     significant changes in PROQOL and empathy. Focus groups suggested 
     CALM-N helped nurses' understanding of patients and nurse-patient 
     communication and increased reflection and perspective taking. 
     Conclusion. CALM-N is a feasible and acceptable intervention for 
     oncology nurses, with the potential to improve nurse-patient 
     communication and the nurses' reflective capacities. Implications for 
     Nursing Practice. CALM-N has the potential to improve the capacity of 
     oncology nurses to provide psychosocial care for advanced cancer 
     patients and its application to nursing practice merits further 
     investigation.]

     negatively impact their quality of life (QoL) and spiritual 
     well-being. Music therapy can be used for symptom management in these 
     patients. However, the effectiveness is uncertain. To determine the 
     effectiveness of music therapy on spiritual well-being, QoL, pain, 
     and psychological distress using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 
     Data Source. A systematic search was conducted in EMBASE, PubMed, 
     Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrial.gov 
     registry up to September 2022.Conclusion. The meta-analysis included 
     seven RCTs with a total of 747 advanced cancer patients. Music 
     therapy was found to significantly improve spiritual well-being with 
     a mean difference of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.25 to 0.61, P < .001) in the 
     intervention group compared to the control group. However, no 
     significant group differences were found between the intervention and 
     control groups for QoL (SMD: 0.53, 95% CI: -0.12 to 1.13, P = .11), 
     pain (MD: -0.81, 95% CI: -2.06 to 0.44, P = .20), and psychological 
     distress (SMD: -0.05, 95% CI: -0.41 to 0.32, P = .81). Music therapy 
     can effectively improve the spiritual well-being of palliative care 
     patients. However, its beneficial effects on QoL, pain, and 
     psychological distress were minimal. Implications for Nursing 
     Practice. Music therapy interventions can be introduced to help 
     patients deal with spiritual/existential needs. Future studies should 
     identify optimal characteristics of music therapy interventions to 
     aid in enhancing the quality of palliative care for patients with 
     advanced cancer.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives.There is a need for better information 
     exchange between primary and secondary care healthcare professionals 
     in cancer patients with limited life expectancy, most of whom prefer 
     to be at home but are admitted frequently at the end of life (EoL). 
     We conducted a file search to assess this among our patients and 
     developed a discharge pathway to decrease readmission rate and dying 
     in hospital. Data Sources. We performed an in-depth file search among 
     150 patients who died within 1 month after hospital admission (July 
     2013 to January 2014); 60 were admitted once, and 90 were admitted 
     twice or more. Mean time spent in hospital at EoL was 12 days; 37% 
     died in hospital, and 49% died at home. We included 31 admitted 
     cancer patients at the EoL in whom home-discharge was planned for the 
     intervention (February 2017 to December 2018). Median survival was 24 
     days, time spent in hospital decreased from 15.5 to 2.5 days, and 
     number of readmissions fell from 2.8 to 0.57. One patient (3.1%) died 
     in hospital, and 77% died at home. And 78% of general practitioners 
     found the provided information useful. Conclusion. A proactive 
     discharge pathway may reduce hospital readmission rates, time spent 
     in hospital, and in-hospital death. Implications for Nursing 
     Practice. Ever more patients with complex care needs at the EoL are 
     being discharged early. Being informed about patients' wishes, 
     preferences, and treatment options for symptom management at home is 
     essential for doctors and nurses in primary care. A systematic 
     discharge pathway can be useful for information transfer when 
     admitted patients are discharged home.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. People who identify as lesbian, gay, 
     bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) face inequalities in healthcare and 
     are receiving less palliative and end-of-life care than others with a 
     comparable need. Since the global resolution to improve palliative 
     care made by the World Health Assembly, the World Health 
     Organization, and member states, some progress has been made. 
     However, LGBT+ people are discriminated and marginalized, which leads 
     to suboptimal palliative care. Research on the needs of LGBT+ people 
     and their access to palliative care is limited. Therefore, the aim of 
     this discussion article is to scope unique problems around palliative 
     and end-of-life care for LGBT+ people and identify possible solutions 
     to address these problems with direct links to nursing practice. Data 
     sources. Journal articles and author experience were used for this 
     discussion article. Conclusion. Oncology nurses need to be educated 
     in communication skills, specific assessment tools, and awareness of 
     the history of LGBT+ people. Increasing knowledge for cancer nurses 
     is pivotal because this affects their views, needs, and perceptions 
     in providing palliative and end-of-life care. Implications for 
     Nursing Practice. Oncology nurses have a pivotal role in caring for 
     all cancer patients at the end of their life. LGBT+ patients and 
     their caregivers need competent nurses to support them, especially 
     during transitions. Implementing LGBT+-inclusive education, training, 
     and practice will improve outcomes for LGBT cancer patients and their 
     caregivers, and potentially all patients. More research is needed to 
     implement such training in nursing education. ("LGBT+" has been used 
     throughout the article. There are many arguments in favor of using 
     different variations of the acronym, but for purposes of 
     understanding and ease, LGBT+ is the acronym of choice here.)]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Albeit treatable, metastatic breast cancer 
     (MBC) remains incurable. To achieve remaining life years lived well, 
     extended survival should be balanced with optimal health-related 
     quality of life (HRQoL) and timely initiated supportive, palliative, 
     and end-of-life care. The Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC) Global 
     Alliance identified 10 urgent and actionable goals for the decade 
     between 2015 and 2025 to achieve substantial improvement in the lives 
     of patients living with ABC, including MBC. Enhancements are needed 
     for HRQoL, research, quality of care, and survival. We explore the 
     potential of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in addressing 
     these gaps and aim to describe opportunities and current initiatives 
     for improving the MBC care continuum through PROMs. Data sources. 
     Narrative description of recent literature on MBC and PROMs. 
     Conclusion. We believe PROMs can make valuable contributions to seven 
     of the 10 goals described: 1) enhancing the understanding of MBC 
     through high-quality data collection, 2) improving HRQoL and raising 
     consideration of survival versus HRQoL, 2) prolonging survival, 4) 
     increasing referral to nonclinical support services, 5) supporting 
     patient-healthcare provider communication, 6) encouraging 
     improvements in healthcare access, and 7) supporting meeting 
     patients' informational needs. Implications for Nursing Practice. 
     Maximizing the benefits of PROMs requires effective implementation. 
     Because nurses and nurse practitioners are at the forefront of care, 
     they can offer a comprehensive understanding of patients' needs and 
     play a crucial role in facilitating the integration of PROMs into 
     routine care for MBC patients and ultimately optimizing patients' 
     outcomes and life years and months left.]

     AB: ABSTRACT. Objectives. End-of-life care for cancer patients is one 
     of the most challenging experiences encountered by nurses. Cancer 
     nurses providing end-of-life care may experience compassion fatigue 
     due to prolonged exposure to the suffering and intense emotional 
     reactions of patients, death and the dying, and grieving families. 
     However, the development of resilience and effective coping skills 
     can decrease nurse turnover rates and increase the quality of 
     palliative cancer care. This article discusses the concept of 
     compassion fatigue, how it develops, compassion fatigue experienced 
     by nurses providing palliative cancer care, and the Compassion 
     Fatigue Resiliency Program (CFRP) coping method. Data Sources. Author 
     experience and journal articles were used. . Conclusion: Compassion 
     fatigue can occur from secondary traumatic stress and burnout after 
     nurses' prolonged and intense exposure to helping suffering patients, 
     resulting in decreased ability to care, expend energy, or exhibit 
     empathy and compassion. The CFRP is a structured, comprehensive 
     training program designed to educate nurses about compassion fatigue 
     and enable them to develop a support network, strengthen their coping 
     skills, and improve resilience. Implications for Nursing Practice. It 
     is recommended that the CFRP be included in in-service training in 
     institutions and be applied to oncology nurses at regular intervals 
     in a block program format (1-2 days). Newly recruited oncology nurses 
     in particular should be supported with such training in orientation 
     programs. Institutional managers play an important role in organizing 
     such programs and screening for the risk of compassion fatigue in 
     nurses who provide end-of-life care.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. Evaluate the efficacy of exercise 
     rehabilitation at improving physical function during active treatment 
     for adults diagnosed with a hematological malignancy. Data Source. 
     Systematic review with a multilevel meta-analysis of randomized 
     trails was conducted. Four electronic databases, MEDLINE (EBSCOhost), 
     CINAHL, Scopus, and CENTRAL, were searched using key words and 
     medical subject headings. Articles were screened and assessed against 
     the predetermined eligibility criteria. Data extracted were appraised 
     using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials and the 
     GRADE guidelines. A meta-analysis examined four key clinical 
     objectives. Conclusion. Twelve studies representing a total of 812 
     participants were included. Analysis of 36 dependent effect sizes 
     from nine studies revealed structured and prescribed exercise 
     interventions improved physical function (SMD = 0.39; 95% CI 
     0.21-0.57) compared to usual care or an active control. Exercise 
     interventions with a multimodal design consisting of both aerobic and 
     resistance exercise had a statistically significant effect on 
     physical function (P < .001). Exercise intensity also had a 
     statistically significant effect on physical function when prescribed 
     at a moderate (P = .003) and vigorous (P < .001) intensity during 
     active treatment in patients with leukemia or lymphoma. Implications 
     for Nursing Practice. This review suggests individuals diagnosed with 
     leukemia or lymphoma can optimize physical function during and 
     immediately post-treatment by attending exercise rehabilitation 3-5 
     times per weeks performing moderate-vigorous aerobic and resistance 
     exercise. While further research is needed to identify optimal 
     prescription guidelines throughout the treatment continuum, this 
     review underscores the importance for hematology nurses to support 
     patient referrals to exercise oncology professionals to gain positive 
     improvements in physical function.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Approvals of chimeric antigen receptor 
     T-cell (CAR-T) therapies for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma 
     (RRMM) represent advancements in treatment options for a 
     hard-to-treat population. Nursing care during CAR-T therapy is 
     crucial for patients, their caregivers, and the broader CAR-T therapy 
     care team. This manuscript provides an overview of the CAR-T therapy 
     administration process and describes practical considerations for 
     nursing professionals working with patients who receive CAR-T 
     therapy. Data Sources. Current literature describing CAR-T therapies 
     for RRMM and published guidelines on nursing care during CAR-T 
     therapy administration were identified from a PubMed database search. 
     Literature was synthesized with practical considerations from nurses 
     and nurse practitioners with expertise in the administration of CAR-T 
     therapy for MM. A practical overview of the role of nursing 
     professionals throughout all stages of CAR-T therapy administration 
     for RRMM is provided. Conclusion. Planning, administration, and 
     posttreatment monitoring for CAR-T therapy requires collaboration 
     between nursing professionals and other healthcare providers as 
     patients migrate between community oncology providers and specialized 
     treatment centers. Nurses help with assessment of patient eligibility 
     and patient and caregiver education before CAR-T therapy. They act in 
     diverse roles across various settings involved in CAR-T therapy 
     administration. Finally, nurses contribute to long-term 
     identification and management of CAR-T-associated toxicities. 
     Implications for Nursing Practice. Nurses are crucial to the CAR-T 
     therapy process and make significant contributions to optimizing 
     patient care and subsequent outcomes.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. To describe the experiences of people 
     diagnosed with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data Sources. 
     Qualitative data were collected through semistructured interviews 
     conducted with people affected by cancer in the Australian context. 
     Following institutional ethical approval, interviews were conducted 
     over Microsoft Teams and Zoom platforms and complied with 
     confidentiality requirements. Data were transcribed verbatim and 
     analyzed, and emergent themes were developed using thematic analysis 
     to understand patient experiences of cancer care during the COVID-19 
     pandemic. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic was disruptive to the 
     daily experiences of supportive care. Four overarching themes were 
     identified related to: 1) the impact on accessing healthcare 
     services, 2) encounters with healthcare professionals, 3) the impact 
     on daily living, and 4) the impact of COVID on psychological 
     well-being. Implications for Nursing Practice. As the COVID-19 
     pandemic held global consequences on cancer practices, it is 
     recommended that nursing and other multidisciplinary healthcare 
     professionals reflect upon these findings, in the context of planning 
     for future pandemics. We encourage further exploration into the

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Mobile devices facilitate the healthcare 
     management of breast cancer. Meanwhile, specialist nurses play an 
     important role in disease management. We established a 
     smartphone-based app that enables patients to raise questions to 
     specialist nurses. We aimed to evaluate whether the information 
     support provided by specialist nurses via smartphone app could 
     improve the treatment adherence of breast cancer patients. Data 
     Source. Breast cancer patients who received surgery and registered 
     for the app between March 2013 and April 2020 were included. Data 
     related to the use of the app, the number of raised questions, and 
     the specific content of each question were retrieved. Overall, 2675 
     patients were included, with 560 patients raising questions to 
     specialist nurses via the app. Patients with higher educational 
     levels, postmenopause status, and more advanced diseases were more 
     likely to seek informational support via a smartphone app. The 
     treatment adherence was 86.4%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated 
     that raising questions was associated with better compliance. 
     Regarding the distribution of questions, 78.8% of patients had 
     questions about the treatment schedule and procedure, 65.9% of 
     patients had questions during the adjuvant treatment, and only 19.6% 
     of patients raised questions about follow-up and rehabilitation. 
     After a median follow-up of 44 months, there was no survival 
     difference between patients who raised questions and those who did 
     not. Conclusion. Seeking information support from specialist nurses 
     was associated with better treatment adherence. The smartphone-based 
     healthcare app enables specialist nurses to provide more conducive 
     service for patients, and validation of this finding in further 
     studies is warranted. Implications for Nursing Practice. Breast 
     cancer patients were more interested in problems with treatment 
     procedures and schedules. Those who asked questions had better 
     treatment adherence. The smartphone-based app could not only provide 
     patients with a platform to seek information support but also help 
     specialist nurses understand the needs of patients.]

     subsequently underwent mastectomy. Data Sources. This randomized 
     controlled trial enrolled 48 breast cancer patients who underwent 
     mastectomy at a medical center in Taiwan. The patients were randomly 
     assigned to either the intervention group (n = 24) or control group 
     (n = 24). The patients in the intervention group participated in a 
     12-week upper limb rehabilitation program involving face-to-face 
     upper limb rehabilitation education and once-a month monitoring of 
     their upper extremity activity. The control group received standard 
     nursing care. Quality of life was assessed through EORTC QLQ-C30 and 
     QLQ-BR 23 questionnaires at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 after 
     enrollment. Results. Both the intervention and control groups had 
     significantly improved their levels of functioning, symptoms, and 
     quality of life from baseline to week 12 after enrollment. The 
     intervention group showed greater improvements in functioning and 
     symptom levels after the intervention compared to the control group; 
     however, no statistically significant differences were found. 
     Additionally, the levels of global health status/quality of life in 
     both groups gradually increased from baseline to week 12 Conclusion. 
     An upper limb rehabilitation program is effective in improving the 
     functioning and symptoms of breast cancer patients who have undergone 
     mastectomy. Implications for Nursing Practice. Patients are 
     encouraged to undergo upper limb rehabilitation in order to improve 
     their functioning, symptoms and quality of life.]

     with distinct joint cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) AND 
     anxiety profiles and evaluate for differences in demographic and 
     clinical characteristics, as well as levels of global stress, 
     cancer-specific stress, cumulative life stress, and resilience. Data 
     Sources. Patients (n = 1332) completed the Attentional Function Index 
     and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory six times over two cycles 
     of chemotherapy. Global, cancer-specific, and cumulative life stress 
     and resilience were evaluated using Perceived Stress Scale, Impact of 
     Event Scale-Revised, Life Stressor Checklist-Revised, and 
     Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, respectively. Latent profile 
     analysis was used to identify subgroups of patients with distinct 
     joint CRCI AND anxiety profiles. Differences were evaluated using 
     parametric and nonparametric tests. Results. Three classes were 
     identified (ie, No CRCI and Low Anxiety [57.3%], Moderate CRCI and 
     Moderate Anxiety [34.5%], and High CRCI and High Anxiety [8.2%]). All 
     of the stress measures showed a dose-response effect (ie, as the CRCI 
     AND anxiety profile worsened, scores for all three types of stress 
     increased). The two highest symptom classes reported higher 
     occurrence rates for six specific stressors (eg, emotional abuse, 
     physical abuse, sexual harassment). Conclusions. Findings suggest 
     that higher levels of co-occurring CRCI AND anxiety are associated 
     with some common risk factors, as well as higher levels of stress and 
     lower levels of resilience. Increased knowledge of modifiable risk 
     factors and sources of stress associated with the co-occurrence of 
     these two symptoms will assist clinicians to identify high-risk 
     patients and implement individualized interventions.]

     study samples, the EMA sampling procedures, EMA completion rates, 
     outcome measures, and any implications of findings for survivorship 
     care. Conclusion. A total of 42 EMA studies in cancer were included. 
     Most studies used an electronic mobile device to capture EMA data 
     apart from several that used paper diaries. Existing studies were 
     found to have significant heterogeneity in methods and widely varying 
     approaches to design and self-report measurements. While EMA in 
     cancer research holds significant promise to advance cancer care 
     research into the future by increasing ecological validity and 
     reducing retrospective bias and can capture the unique idiographic 
     within-person change over time, in real-time, further research is 
     needed to develop standardized EMA self-report questionnaires. 
     Implications for Nursing Practice. This is the first comprehensive 
     systematic review to describe the use and methods of EMA in cancer 
     research. There is significant heterogeneity in methods and widely 
     varying approaches to design and self-report measurements in EMA 
     cancer research. People affected by cancer found taking part in EMA 
     studies reported benefit from the experience. However, researchers 
     must engage with cancer survivors in the development and co-design of 
     future EMA questionnaires to ensure relevant and acceptability of EMA 
     data collection protocols.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Adherence by oncology nurses to 
     chemotherapy safe handling guidelines is essential to prevent hazards 
     of chemotherapy exposure. A review of the literature revealed the 
     need for an instrument with evidence of reliability and validity to 
     measure factors influencing adherence to safe chemotherapy-handling 
     guidelines among oncology nurses. The purpose of this study was to 
     psychometrically test the Oncology Nurses' Health Behaviors 
     Determinants Scale (HBDS-ON) that measures the mentioned factors. 
     Data Sources. Methodological research of a quantitative 
     cross-sectional survey design was used. The study surveys were 
     administered by email to a sample of 108 oncology nurses. Cronbach 
     alpha, item analysis, exploratory factor analysis using principal 
     axis factoring, and convergence validity testing were used to test 
     reliability and validity. Conclusion. Factor analysis yielded six 
     subscales, each having acceptable internal consistency reliability 
     (Cronbach alpha between 0.70 and 0.88). The subscales included four 
     oncology nurse health beliefs (perceived threat, benefits, barriers, 
     and self-efficacy), cues to action, and personal protective equipment 
     availability and accessibility. Convergence validity testing results 
     support the Oncology Nurses Health Behaviors Determinant Scale 
     (HBDS-ON) construct validity. Oncology nurses' self-efficacy to 
     adherence to chemotherapy-handling guidelines, the perceived barriers 
     to adhere to chemotherapy-handling guidelines, and cues to action are 
     associated with adherence to chemotherapy-handling guidelines. 
     Implications for Nursing Practice. Oncology nurses' health beliefs, 
     the cues to action, and personal protection equipment availability 
     and accessibility are important determinants of nurses' adherence to 
     chemotherapy-handling guidelines. The HBDS-ON is an instrument that 
     has evidence of reliability and validity and could be used in 
     practice to measure these determinants.]

     AB: ABSTRACT. Objectives. Physical and cognitive function are two of 
     the most important patient-reported outcomes. In oncology patients 
     receiving chemotherapy (N = 1331), purposes were to identify 
     subgroups of patients with distinct joint physical and cognitive 
     function profiles and evaluate for differences in demographic and 
     clinical characteristics, severity of common symptoms, and quality of 
     life outcomes. Data Sources. Measures of physical and cognitive 
     functions were obtained six times over two cycles of chemotherapy. 
     All of the other measures were done prior to the second or third 
     cycle of chemotherapy. Latent profile analysis was done to identify 
     the distinct joint physical and cognitive function profiles. 
     Differences among the profiles were evaluated using parametric and 
     nonparametric tests. Conclusion. Five distinct profiles were 
     identified (ie, Very Low Physical and Low Cognitive Function [18.4%; 
     Both Low], Low Physical and High Cognitive Function [19.8%], Moderate 
     Physical and Low Cognitive Function [26.7%], Changing Physical and 
     Cognitive Function [5.4%], and Normal Physical and Cognitive Function 
     [29.7%]). Patients in the Both Low class had the highest symptom 
     burden and the poorest quality of life. Over 70% of the sample had 
     moderate to severe decrements in one or both of these extremely 
     important patient outcomes. Implications for Nursing Practice. 
     Clinicians need to assess for both physical and cognitive function 
     using simple subjective and objective measures.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are 
     commonly used in clinical practice, and an important aspect is how 
     healthcare professionals use these measures to make clinical 
     decisions. This study aimed 1) to understand how remote electronic 
     symptom monitoring using PRO measures can support oncology nurses' 
     clinical decision-making in patients with metastatic lung cancer and 
     2) to explore factors that potentially can influence how remote 
     symptom monitoring supports clinical decision-making. Data Sources. A 
     qualitative approach using semistructured interviews was conducted 
     with 18 registered nurses working with remote symptom monitoring at 
     oncology departments at eight Danish hospitals. Conclusion. Nurses 
     reported that remote symptom monitoring supports clinical 
     decision-making because it assisted in identifying relevant problems, 
     monitoring relevant changes over time, and prompting relevant 
     clinical actions. Factors that affected how remote symptom monitoring 
     could support clinical decision-making were access to supplemental 
     information, the trustworthiness of PRO data, nursing competencies 
     and responsibilities, working conditions, and care at a distance. 
     Implication for Nursing Practice. The use of PRO data in the clinical 
     decision-making process is highly dependent on the nurses' 
     professional competencies, the organizational structure, and the 
     trustworthiness of PRO data. Thus, we recommend considering these 
     factors before implementing PRO data in routine care. For example, 
     train clinical staff in using PRO data in their clinical 
     decision-making, develop guidance for how to use PRO data with other 
     forms of data to make sound clinical actions, and ensure that 
     organizational resources are sufficient.]

     AB: Abstract. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
     effects of arm- and back-support exoskeletons on reactive balance 
     after slip-like and trip-like perturbations on a treadmill. 
     Twenty-eight participants used two arm-support exoskeletons and two 
     back-support exoskeletons with support (i.e. assistive joint torque) 
     activated or deactivated. In each exoskeleton condition, as well in 
     as a control without any exoskeleton, participants were exposed to 12 
     treadmill perturbations during upright standing. The exoskeletons did 
     not significantly increase the probability of a failed recovery after 
     the perturbations compared to wearing no exoskeleton, but did elicit 
     effects on kinematic variables that suggested balance recovery was 
     more challenging. Moreover, reactive balance differed when wearing 
     back-support and arm-support exoskeletons, and when wearing an 
     activated exoskeleton compared to a deactivated exoskeleton. 
     Together, our results suggest these exoskeletons may increase the 
     risk of slip- and trip-induced falls. The potential mechanisms of 
     this increased risk are discussed and include the added mass and/or 
     motion restrictions associated with wearing these exoskeletons. Our 
     results do not support the assistive hip/back extension moment 
     provided by back-support exoskeletons adversely affecting fall risk.]

     AB: Abstract. The identification of personalized preventive 
     strategies plays a major role in contrasting the occurrence of 
     work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This requires the 
     identification of distinct movement patterns within large samples and 
     the attribution of a proper risk level to each identified movement 
     phenotype. We assessed the feasibility of this approach by exploiting 
     wearable inertial measurement units to estimate the whole-body 
     kinematics of 43 healthy participants performing 18 
     reach-to-manipulate movements, which differed based on the object's 
     position in the space and the type of manipulation required. Through 
     unsupervised clustering, we identified multiple movement phenotypes 
     graded by ergonomic performance. Furthermore, we determined which 
     joints mostly contributed to instantiating the ergonomic differences 
     across clusters, emphasizing the importance of monitoring this aspect 
     during occupational gestures. Overall, our analysis suggests that 
     movement phenotypes can be identified within occupational motor 
     repertoires. Assigning individual performance to specific phenotypes 
     has the potential to inform the development of more effective and 
     tailored interventions.]

     AB: Abstract. This study investigated the effects of back muscle 
     fatigue on the estimation of low-back loads and active low-back 
     moments during lifting, using an EMG and kinematics based model 
     calibrated with data from an unfatigued state. Fourteen participants 
     performed lifting tasks in unfatigued and fatigued states. Fatigue 
     was induced through semi-static forward bending. EMG, kinematics, and 
     ground reaction forces were measured, and low-back loads were 
     estimated using inverse dynamics and EMG-driven muscle model. A 
     regression model was developed using data from a set of calibration 
     lifts, and its accuracy was evaluated for unfatigued and fatigued 
     lifts. During the fatigue-inducing task, the EMG amplitude increased 
     by 2.8 %MVC, representing a 38% increase relative to the initial 
     value. However, during the fatigued lifts, the peak EMG amplitude was 
     found to be 1.6 %MVC higher than that observed during the unfatigued 
     lifts, representing a mere 4% increase relative to the baseline 
     unfatigued peak EMG amplitude. Kinematics and low-back load estimates 
     remained unaffected. Regression model estimation errors remained 
     unaffected for 5 kg lifts, but increased by no more than 5% of the 
     peak active low-back moment for 15 kg lifts. We conclude that the 
     regression-based estimation quality of active low-back moments can be 
     maintained during periods of muscle fatigue, although errors may 
     slightly increase for heavier loads.]

     AB: Abstract. Trunk extensor muscle fatigue typically manifests as a 
     decline in spectral content of surface electromyography. However, 
     previous research on the relationship of this decline with trunk 
     extensor muscle endurance have shown inconsistent results. The 
     decline of spectral content mainly reflects the decrease in average 
     motor unit action potential conduction velocity (CV). We evaluated 
     whether the rate of change in CV, as well as two approaches employing 
     the change in spectral content, are related to trunk extensor muscle 
     endurance. Fourteen healthy male participants without a low-back pain 
     history performed a non-strictly controlled static forward trunk 
     bending trial until exhaustion while standing. For 13 participants, 
     physiologically plausible CV estimates were obtained from 
     high-density surface electromyography bilaterally from T6 to L5. 
     Laterally between L1 and L2, the linear rate of CV change was 
     strongly correlated to endurance time (R2 = 0.79), whereas analyses 
     involving the linear rate of change in spectral measures showed a 
     lower (R2 = 0.38) or no correlation. For medial electrode locations, 
     estimating CV and its relationship with endurance time was less 
     successful, while the linear rate of change in spectral measures 
     correlated moderately to endurance time (R2 = 0.44; R2 = 0.56). This 
     study provides guidance on monitoring trunk extensor muscle fatigue 
     development using electromyography.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Muscle elasticity can be quantified with shear

     force but reliability has not been established for lower leg muscles. 
     The purpose of this study was to examine the intra-rater and 
     inter-rater reliability of elasticity measures in non-weight-bearing 
     (NWB) and weight-bearing (WB) for the tibialis anterior (TA), 
     tibialis posterior (TP), peroneal longus (PL), and peroneal brevis 
     (PB) muscles using SWE. Methods. A total of 109 recreationally active 
     healthy adults participated. The study employed a single-cohort, 
     same-day repeated-measures test-retest design. Elasticity, measured 
     in kilopascals as the Young's modulus, was converted to the shear 
     modulus. All four muscles were measured in NWB and at 90% WB. 
     Results. Intra-rater reliability estimates were good to excellent for 
     NWB (ICC = 0.930-0.988) and WB (ICC = 0.877-0.978) measures. 
     Inter-rater reliability estimates were moderate to good (ICC = 
     0.500-0.795) for NWB measures and poor to good (ICC = 0.346-0.910) 
     for WB measures. Conclusion. Despite the studies poor to good 
     inter-rater variability, the intra-rater reproducibility represents 
     the potential benefit of SWE in NWB and WB. Establishing the 
     reliability of SWE with clinical and biomechanical approaches may aid 
     in improved understanding of the mechanical properties of muscle.]

     AB: Abstract. The smallest voluntarily controlled structure of the 
     human body is the motor unit (MU), comprised of a motoneuron and its 
     innervated fibres. MUs have been investigated in neurophysiology 
     research and clinical applications, primarily using electromyographic 
     (EMG) techniques. Nonetheless, EMG (both surface and intramuscular) 
     has a limited detection volume. A recent alternative approach to 
     detect MUs is ultrafast ultrasound (UUS) imaging. The possibility of 
     identifying MU activity from UUS has been shown by blind source 
     separation (BSS) of UUS images, using optimal separation spatial 
     filters. However, this approach has yet to be fully compared with EMG 
     techniques for a large population of unique MU spike trains. Here we 
     identify individual MU activity in UUS images using the BSS method 
     for 401 MU spike trains from eleven participants based on concurrent 
     recordings of either surface or intramuscular EMG from forces up to 
     30% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force. We assessed the 
     BSS method's ability to identify MU spike trains from direct 
     comparison with the EMG-derived spike trains as well as twitch areas 
     and temporal profiles from comparison with the 
     spike-triggered-averaged UUS images when using the EMG-derived spikes 
     as triggers. We found a moderate rate of correctly identified spikes 
     (53.0 ± 16.0%) with respect to the EMG-identified firings. However, 
     the MU twitch areas and temporal profiles could still be identified 
     accurately, including at 30% MVC force. These results suggest that 
     the current BSS methods for UUS can accurately identify the location 
     and average twitch of a large pool of MUs in UUS images, providing 
     potential avenues for studying neuromechanics from a large 
     cross-section of the muscle. On the other hand, more advanced methods 
     are needed to address the convolutive and partly non-linear summation 
     of velocities for recovering the full spike trains.]

     specific tasks. The torso, humerus, and scapula were tracked with 
     optical motion capture in two sessions for ten pain-free 
     participants. Scapular calibrations were completed in five poses: 
     neutral, maximum elevation, 90° abduction, hand to contralateral

     difference, limits of agreement, intraclass correlations, and minimal 
     detectable change (MDC) were calculated for each task and elevation 
     level. The inclusion of different calibration poses did not markedly 
     improve outcomes over the maximum elevation double calibration for

     AB: Abstract. Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals are muscle 
     activation signals, which has applications in muscle diagnosis, 
     rehabilitation, prosthetics, and speech etc. However, they are known 
     to be affected by noises such as Power Line Interference (PLI), 
     motion artifacts etc. Currently, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) 
     and its modifications such as Ensemble EMD (EEMD), and Complementary 
     EEMD (CEEMD) are used to decompose EMG into a series of Intrinsic 
     Mode Functions (IMFs). The denoised EMG can be obtained from the 
     selected IMFs. Statistical methods are used to select the signal 
     dominant IMFs to reconstruct the denoised signal. In this work, a 
     novel procedure is proposed to automatically separate noisy IMFs from 
     the original sEMG signal. For this purpose, Permutation Entropy (PE) 
     is employed in EEMD sifting process called Partly EEMD (PEEMD), to 
     separate the noisy IMFs from the original sEMG signal according to 
     the preset PE threshold. PEEMD decomposes the original signal into 
     various modes according to a preset PE threshold and the denoised 
     signal is reconstructed from resultant IMFs. The PEEMD denoising 
     procedure is applied on the experimental sEMG data collected from 
     eight subjects, that include six various upper limb movement classes. 
     The proposed denoising procedure achieved an improved denoising 
     performance in comparison with EMD, EEMD, and CEEMD. An alternate 
     measure called Sample Entropy (SE) is also used in place of PE, for 
     the automated sifting process as a comparison. Signal to Noise Ratio 
     (SNR), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Reconstruction Error (RE) 
     parameters are used to evaluate the denoising performance. The 
     results, averaged across eight subjects, demonstrate that the 
     proposed denoising procedure outperforms the state-of-the-art EMD 
     techniques in terms of these performance measures on the 
     experimentally collected sEMG data samples.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. This study aimed i) to investigate the 
     mechanical, morphological, and compositional characteristics of the 
     supraspinatus muscle after rotator cuff repair by using ultrasound 
     shear wave elastography (SWE) and B-mode imaging, and ii) to 
     determine whether the morphological or compositional characteristics 
     are associated with the mechanical characteristic of the 
     supraspinatus during contraction. Methods. Using SWE and B-mode 
     imaging, active and passive shear moduli, muscle thickness, and echo 
     intensity of the supraspinatus were measured from the repaired and 
     contralateral control shoulders of 22 patients with rotator cuff 
     repair. The shear modulus, muscle thickness, and echo intensity were 
     compared between the repaired and control shoulders. The association 
     between the active shear modulus and the other variables was 
     determined. Results. While the active and passive shear moduli were 
     lower in the repaired shoulder compared to the control, the muscle 
     thickness and echo intensity did not vary between them. 
     Interestingly, the passive shear modulus was positively correlated 
     with the active shear modulus only in the control shoulder. 
     Conclusion. The mechanical characteristic of supraspinatus remains 
     impaired, even without degenerative changes in the morphological and 
     compositional characteristics after rotator cuff repair. Furthermore, 
     the association between contractile and elastic characteristics in 
     the supraspinatus was deteriorated in control shoulder.]

     AB: Abstract. The purpose of our study was to compare the influence 
     of two types of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on 
     the performance of older adults on the 6-min test of walking 
     endurance and on the ability to maintain balance during upright 
     standing. Twenty-six healthy older adults (72 ± 5.4 yrs) performed 
     tests of motor function while TENS was applied to the tibialis 
     anterior and rectus femoris muscles of each leg. Linear mixed models 
     were used to compare the influence of TENS on walking distance in a 
     6-min test of walking endurance and on sway-area rate in tests of 
     standing balance. There was a significant decrease in the distances 
     walked in each minute of the 6-min walk test for both the Continuous 
     and Burst TENS modes compared with Baseline (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, 
     respectively). The influence of TENS on walking distance was 
     associated with several significant effects on the mean and 
     coefficient of variation for stride length and stride frequency 
     between the first and last minute of the test and between the two 
     TENS modes and the Baseline values. In contrast, there was no 
     significant effect of TENS on sway-area rate in any balance test, 
     which indicates that the supplementary sensory feedback compromised 
     walking performance of older adults but not the ability to maintain 
     balance during upright standing.]

     AB: Abstract. The aim of the study was to assess the potential 
     influence of footedness and dominance on maximal force, force 
     fluctuations and neural drive during dorsiflexion. Fifteen 
     left-footed (LF) and fifteen right-footed (RF) young adults performed 
     2 maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) and 3 steady submaximal 
     isometric contractions at five target forces (5, 10, 20, 40 and 60% 
     MVC) with the dorsiflexors of both legs. High-density 
     electromyography (EMG) was used to record the discharge 
     characteristics of motor units (MUs) of Tibialis Anterior. MVC force 
     and EMG amplitude (root mean square) were similar between the two 
     legs and groups (p > 0.05). Force fluctuations (Coefficient of 
     Variation, CoV for force), mean discharge rate of MUs, discharge 
     variability (CoV of interspike interval), and variability in neural 
     drive (standard deviation of filtered cumulative spike train) were 
     greater (p < 0.05) and the input-output gain of the MUs (ΔDR/ΔF) was 
     lower (p < 0.05) for the LF relative to the RF group. The differences 
     in force fluctuations during steady contractions with the 
     dorsiflexors were associated with footedness but not with dominance. 
     They reflect greater variability in motor neuron output, as suggested 
     by coefficient of variation for interspike interval (independent 
     input) and the standard deviation of the smoothed discharge times 
     (common input).]

     AB: Abstract. Knee abduction and hip adduction during functional 
     tasks may indicate increased joint injury risk and discriminate 
     between pathological and healthy people. Muscles' neuromuscular 
     variables such as amplitude (EMGAMP) and onset (EMGONSET) have been 
     used to explain kinematics. The study aimed to evaluate the 
     correlation between two EMG variables of seven trunk and lower limb 
     muscles and 3D kinematics during two tasks. Eighteen 
     physically-active women participated in the study. The following 
     variables were obtained during single-leg squat and anterior 
     step-down: (i) EMGAMP and EMGONSET of fibularis longus (FL), tibialis 
     anterior (TA), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), gluteus 
     medius (GMED), ipsilateral (OB_IL) and contralateral (OB_CL) external 
     obliques and (ii) knee abduction and hip adduction angular 
     displacement (initial angle - angle at 60° of knee flexion). 
     Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between kinematic 
     and EMG variables. Greater knee abduction was correlated with delayed 
     TAONSET, GMEDONSET and OB_ILONSET during step-down. Greater hip 
     adduction was correlated with lower VMAMP, BFAMP and delayed VMONSET 
     during step-down. Although task-specific, these results suggest that 
     EMGONSET may influence knee abduction, while both EMGONSET and EMGAMP 
     may affect hip adduction. The identification of muscle activation 
     patterns in relation to kinematics may help the development of injury 
     prevention and rehabilitation programs.]

     AB: Abstract. This study aims to identify how spatial distribution of 
     lumbar muscle activity is modulated by different fatigue tasks. 
     Twenty healthy adults performed two different isometric trunk 
     extension endurance tasks (the modified Sorensen test and the 
     inverted modified Sorensen test) until exhaustion. During these 
     tasks, bilateral superficial lumbar muscle activity was recorded 
     using high-density electromyography. The spatial distribution of 
     activation within these muscles was obtained using the centroid 
     coordinates in the medio-lateral and cranio-caudal directions. The 
     effects of task and endurance time (left and right sides) were 
     investigated using repeated measures ANOVA. Results revealed a 
     significant lateral shift of the centroid throughout the fatigue 
     tasks on both sides and no difference between tasks. Significant task 
     × time interaction effects were found for the cranio-caudal direction 
     on both sides showing a significantly more caudal location of the 
     centroid in the modified Sorensen test compared to the inverted test 
     at the beginning of the tasks. Our findings suggest that spatial 
     distribution of lumbar muscle activity is task-dependent in a 
     pre-fatigue stage while an alternative but similar muscle recruitment 
     strategy is used in both tasks to maintain performance in the later 
     stages of muscle fatigue.]

     protocols (P20, P30 and P40), with the same number of stimuli, but 
     different stimulation frequencies (20, 30 and 40 Hz, respectively) 
     and duty cycles [1.2:1.2 s (continuous), 0.8:1.2 s (intermittent) and 
     0.6:1.2 s (intermittent), respectively). Twitch force and the 
     peak-to-peak M-wave amplitude of the thenar muscles were measured 
     before, during and after each protocol at 1-40 Hz in random order. 
     Twelve healthy adults (23-41 years old) were examined for each 
     protocol in random order and in separate sessions. P20 elicited the 
     highest mean force, and P40 the lowest decrease in percent force at 
     the end of the protocol. Force evoked at 1 and 10 Hz decreased less 
     after P40, compared with P20 and P30. The M-wave amplitude was 
     significantly reduced throughout all protocols, with the largest 
     decrease observed during P30. Although an increase in frequency 
     typically induced earlier and greater decrement in force, this was 
     compensated or even reversed by increasing the interval between each 
     stimulation train, while keeping the number of pulses per stimulation 
     cycle constant. The lesser decrease in M-wave amplitude during P40 
     compared with P20 indicates that longer between-train intervals may 
     help maintaining the integrity of neuromuscular propagation.]

     AB: Abstract. Understanding the consequences and ecological relevance 
     of muscle fatigue is important to guide the development of strategies 
     to preserve independence. However, few studies have examined 
     walking-related fatigue and the effects on walking instability. Our 
     purpose was to investigate the effects of prolonged walking on leg 
     muscle activity and vulnerability to balance perturbations. Eighteen 
     healthy young adults completed a 30-min walking trial at their 
     preferred walking speed while leg muscle activities were recorded. 
     Before and after the 30-min walk, participants responded to five 5% 
     body weight lateral force perturbations. Time-frequency analysis with 
     wavelet transformation and principal component analyses assessed 
     neuromuscular adaptations of muscles to prolonged walking. Following 
     prolonged walking, we observed a time-dependent increase in EMG 
     intensities at slower frequencies for the soleus and tibialis 
     anterior and a decrease in mean amplitudes for the soleus, lateral 
     gastrocnemius, and semitendinosus. Mean mediolateral CoM displacement 
     following perturbations averaged 21% larger after the 30-min walk. 
     Our results suggest that walking for 30 min at a comfortable speed 
     elicits complex neuromuscular adaptations indicative of local muscle 
     fatigue and an increased vulnerability to walking balance 
     perturbations. These findings could inform fatigue monitoring systems 
     or walking assistive devices aimed at reducing walking-related 
     fatigue and maintaining independent mobility.]

     activity in subjects with knee osteoarthritis. Twenty-five subjects 
     with knee osteoarthritis and 25 age-matched healthy controls 
     performed maximal voluntary knee extension tasks on an isometric 
     dynamometer. Three different pressure stimuli (no-pressure, 60-mmHg, 
     120-mmHg) were applied using a sphygmomanometer via the cuff covering 
     the knee joint. Peak torque and root-mean-square peak of rectus 
     femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM), and vastus lateralis (VL) were 
     collected and normalized for the no-pressure condition (nTorque-peak 
     and nRMS-peak). Normalized Torque-peak increased from no-pressure to 
     60-mmHg and 120-mmHg in patients, which revealed higher nTorque-peak 
     during 60-mmHg (MD: 10.9%, IC95: 1.8%, 20.1%, p = 0.020) and 120-mmHg 
     (MD: 16.0%, IC95: 4.4%, 27.6%, p = 0.008) conditions than healthy 
     subjects. Moreover, nRMS-peak increased from no-pressure to 60-mmHg 
     for RF, from no-pressure to 120-mmHg for RF, VM and VL, and from 
     60-mmHg to 120 mm-Hg for VL in patients. Patients revealed higher 
     nRMS-peak of RF and VM during 60-mmHg and 120-mmHg conditions than 
     healthy subjects. Periarticular knee pressure stimuli enhanced 
     quadriceps strength and neuromuscular activity in subjects with knee 
     osteoarthritis. This approach may represent a new strength training 
     modality in patients with neuromuscular activation deficits for knee 
     osteoarthritis.]

     AB: Abstract. The habitual use of resistance exercises involving 
     concentric and eccentric contractions can increase muscle strength, 
     speed and endurance. However, current knowledge has limited potential 
     to fully understand the application of such resistance training and 
     the muscle changes that occur to differentiate these two types of 
     training. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 
     concentric contraction (CON) and eccentric contraction (ECC) during 
     an acute bout of resistance training on the hamstring contractile 
     properties. A group of 20 female recreational athletes were divided 
     into two equal groups, CON training and ECC training. The contractile 
     properties of the muscles on both sides of the body were assessed 
     using tensiomyography (TMG): biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus 
     (ST). The muscles were assessed twice, before and after 10 maximal 
     repetitions of either concentric or eccentric isotonic contractions. 
     The results indicate a greater change in TMG parameters with ECC 
     training, with p < 0.001 (Td and Tc). An acute bout of resistance 
     training induces changes in the muscle hamstrings contractile 
     properties in both CON and ECC training. Eccentric training causes 
     greater changes than concentric training, shortening contraction time 
     (Td, Tc), increase radial displacement velocity (Vrd) and affecting 
     changes in muscle belly displacement (Dm), so may be more effective 
     in training.]

     AB: Abstract. The use of shear wave elastography during voluntary 
     contraction has enabled the non-invasive assessment of load sharing 
     strategies between agonist muscles. However, the change in joint 
     angle and voluntary contraction intensity can modify contribution 
     between muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect 
     of knee joint angle on the local mechanical properties of the vastus 
     medialis (VM) and the vastus lateralis (VL) during isometric 
     submaximal voluntary contractions from shear wave elastography 
     mapping. The VM and VL Young's modulus at rest and during constant 
     isometric submaximal voluntary contractions (i.e. 25%, 50% and 75% of 
     maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]) were assessed for two knee 
     angles (50° and 100° | knee fully extended = 0°) in twelve 
     participants. No significant difference was found in the VM Young's 
     modulus among all torque levels and knee angles (p > 0.05). VL 
     Young's modulus was significantly higher at 25% MVC for a knee angle 
     of 100° than at 75% MVC for the same knee angle and was greater at 
     25% MVC for a knee angle of 100° than for 50° (p < 0.05). In contrast 
     to the VM, the contribution of the VL to the knee joint torque 
     production during isometric voluntary contraction appears to depend 
     on the muscle length and the relative knee extension torque level.]

     AB: Abstract. Changes in spinal kinematic variability have been

     performance of various repetitive functional tasks. However, the 
     direction of these changes (i.e. less or more kinematic variability) 
     is not consistent. This study aimed to assess differences in 
     kinematic variability of the 3D angular displacement of thoracic and 
     lumbar spinal segments in people with CNSLBP compared to asymptomatic 
     individuals during a repetitive lifting task. Eleven people with 
     CNSLBP and 11 asymptomatic volunteers performed 10 cycles of 
     multi-planar lifting movements while spinal kinematics were recorded. 
     For the three planes of motion, point-by-point standard deviations 
     (SDs) were computed across all cycles of lifting and the average was 
     calculated as a measure of kinematic variability for both segments. 
     People with CNSLBP displayed higher thoracic (F = 8.00, p = 0.010, 
     ηp2 = 0.286) and lumbar kinematic variability (F = 5.48, p = 0.030, 
     ηp2 = 0.215) in the sagittal plane. Moreover, group differences were

     ηp2 = 0.276) and lumbar kinematic variability (F = 5.402, p = 0.031,

     CNSLBP. A significant main effect of group was not detected (p > 
     0.05) for spinal range of motion (ROM). Thus, people with CNSLBP 
     completed the lifting task with the same ROM in all three planes of 
     motion as observed for asymptomatic individuals, yet they performed 
     the lifting task with higher spinal kinematic cycle-to-cycle

     Twenty-four participants completed a 10-week RT before the

     participants were randomized into two groups: CTL (n = 8 women, n =

     and CR-Edu (n = 16 women, n = 16 legs) who performed 4 weeks of

     differences were observed between the groups (P-interaction > 0.05). 
     The surface electromyography of vastus lateralis decreased only in 
     the CTL group (P-interaction < 0.05). Older women recreationally 
     engaged in RT who perform in unilateral leg extension compared to a 
     brief period of detraining seem not to retain muscle force and power, 
     and sEMG amplitude of their homologous and contralateral limb.]

     AB: Abstract. Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability in 
     the workplace, often caused by manually lifting of heavy loads. 
     Instrumental-based assessment tools are used to quantitatively assess 
     the biomechanical risk of lifting activities. This study aims to 
     verify that, during the execution of fatiguing frequency-dependent 
     lifting, high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) allows the 
     discrimination of healthy controls (HC) versus people with LBP and 
     biomechanical risk levels. Fifteen HC and eight people with LBP 
     performed three lifting tasks with a progressively increasing lifting 
     index, each lasting 15 min. Erector spinae (ES) activity was recorded 
     using HDsEMG and amplitude parameters were calculated to characterize 
     the spatial distribution of muscle activity. LBP group showed a less 
     ES activity than HC (lower root mean square across the grid and of 
     the activation region) and an involvement of the same muscular area 
     across the task (lower coefficient of variation of the center of 
     gravity of muscle activity). The results indicate the usefulness of 
     HDsEMG parameters to classify risk levels for both HC and LBP groups 
     and to determine differences between them. The findings suggest that 
     the use of HDsEMG could expand the capabilities of existing 
     instrumental-based tools for biomechanical risk classification during 
     lifting activities.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Clinical trials have demonstrated positive 
     correlation between pulmonary function and chest wall expansion in 
     COPD. Decrease in chest wall expansion in patients with COPD 
     compromises rib cage mobility and functional length of respiratory 
     muscles that ultimately jeopardize the efficacy and function of 
     respiratory system. Method. Thirty male adults (mean age: 74.97 ± 
     6.29) suffered with severe COPD were randomly allocated to either 
     experimental group (chest wall mobilizations) or control group. Both 
     groups received standardized education and walking exercise 
     (twice/week) for 6 weeks. Patients in experimental group received 
     additional chest wall mobilizations that include stretching and 
     joints mobilization. Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, 
     thoracic excursion, cervical and thoracic range of movement were 
     evaluated at baseline, post-program and at 3-month follow-up. 
     Results. There were significantly greater improvements in respiratory 
     muscle strength, thoracic excursion and thoracic range of movement (p 
     < 0.01) except thoracic flexion. Lower thoracic excursion is strongly 
     associated with increase in maximum inspiratory pressure (β = 13.64, 
     p < 0.001) and maximum expiratory pressure (β = 16.23, p < 0.001). 
     Thoracic range of movement especially extension (p < 0.001) and 
     bilateral rotation (p < 0.01) exhibit a strong relationship with 
     increase in lower thoracic excursion (adjusted R2 = 0.876) as shown 
     in multiple regression analysis. Conclusion. Additional chest wall 
     mobilization in the rehabilitation of patients with COPD is likely to 
     enhance thoracic extension and rotation which increase lower thoracic 
     excursion. This significant improvement in chest expansion capacity 
     allows respiratory muscles to work at an optimal functional length 
     which result in greater respiratory muscle strength in patients with 
     severe COPD.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. Severe acute exacerbations of chronic 
     obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) can have a negative impact on 
     functional capacity, symptoms and health-related quality of life 
     (HRQOL). This study aimed to i) investigate the recovery of muscle 
     strength, functional capacity, symptoms, and HRQOL in patients after 
     a severe AECOPD; ii) compare with matched patients with stable COPD 
     (SCOPD); and iii) assess whether these assessments at hospital 
     discharge could discriminate patients' risk for future events. 
     Methods. This observational study assessed patients with AECOPD 
     during hospital discharge (T1) and one month after discharge (T2). 
     Patients with SCOPD were assessed once. Quadriceps force, handgrip 
     strength, short physical performance battery (SPPB), 6-min walk 
     distance (6 MWD), COPD assessment test (CAT), London chest activity 
     of daily living (LCADL), modified medical research council, checklist 
     individual strength-fatigue, patient health questionnaire, and 
     physical activity (Actigraph) were measured. Exacerbation-related 
     readmission and mortality within six months and 1-year were 
     collected. Results. Forty-four patients with AECOPD were matched with 
     44 patients with SCOPD. At T2, a significant improvement was found 
     for the SPPB total score, 6 MWD, CAT score, and LCADL score. Compared 
     to patients with SCOPD, a worse LCADL score was found at T2 in 
     patients with AECOPD. Patients with AECOPD that were readmitted or 
     died had a worse SPPB classification and five-repetition sit-to-stand 
     test at T1. Conclusion. Patients after severe AECOPD improved in 
     functional capacity and HRQOL one month after hospital discharge, but 
     ADL performance was still worse compared to SCOPD. Patients who were 
     readmitted or died had significantly worse scores on functional tests 
     at hospital discharge.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. A Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
     (COPD) phenotype is a single or group of disease characteristics that 
     describe differences between individuals based on clinically 
     important factors such as symptoms, exacerbations, morbidity, and 
     treatment responses. Many studies estimated the prevalence of various 
     phenotypes, but very few studies looked into their quality of life. 
     We aimed to estimate the prevalence of different COPD phenotypes and 
     their disease-specific Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). 
     Materials and methods. The prospective study, with a sample size of 
     136, was conducted between May 2021 and December 2022 in a tertiary 
     teaching institute. Based on their clinical features, COPD patients 
     were classified into 4 different clinical phenotypes, and their 
     disease-specific quality of life was assessed using St. George 
     Respiratory Questionnaire-COPD(SGRQ-c) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) 
     questionnaires. Results. Among 136 COPD patients, the frequency of 
     Non-Exacerbator (NE), Exacerbator Emphysema (EEM), Exacerbator 
     Chronic Bronchitis (ECB), and Asthma COPD overlap (ACO) phenotypes 
     was 79(58.1 %), 16(11.8 %), 31(22.8 %), and 10(7.4 %) respectively. 
     Based on the SGRQ-c score, the ECB and EEM phenotypes had a 
     significantly poorer Quality of life (QoL) when compared with 
     NE(P<0.0001), ACO(P=0.011), phenotypes. Similarly, ECB and EEM 
     phenotypes had significantly poorer QoL when compared to 
     NE(P<0.0001), and ACO(P=0.015), based on the CAT score. ECB and EEM 
     patients also had the worst scores in all individual CAT items and 
     SGRQ-c components. Conclusion. NE was the most common followed by ECB 
     phenotype. ECB and EEM phenotypes recorded the poorest quality of 
     life without any significant differences among them. Further research 
     is needed in the future to determine whether phenotype-specific 
     therapies can produce better clinical outcomes.]

     physical activity (PA) from 2014 to 2020; to identify sex differences 
     and sociodemographic and health-related factors associated with PA in 
     individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); and to 
     compare PA between individuals with and without COPD. Methods. 
     Cross-sectional and case-control study. Source: European Health 
     Interview Surveys for Spain (EHISS) conducted in 2014 and 2020. We 
     included sociodemographic and health-related covariates. We compared 
     individuals with and without COPD after matching for age and sex. 
     Results. The number of adults with COPD was 1086 and 910 in EHISS2014 
     and EHISS2020, respectively. In this population, self-reported 
     "Medium or high frequency of PA" remained stable (42.9% in 2014 and 
     43.5% in 2020; p = 0.779). However, the percentage who walked on two 
     or more days per week rose significantly over time (63.4%-69.9%; p = 
     0.004). Men with COPD reported more PA than women with COPD in both 
     surveys. After matching, significantly lower levels of PA were 
     recorded in COPD patients than in adults without COPD. Multivariable 
     logistic regression confirmed this trend in COPD patients and showed 
     that male sex, younger age, higher educational level, very good/good 
     self-perceived health, and absence of comorbidities, obesity, and 
     smoking were associated with more frequent PA. Conclusions. The 
     temporal trend in PA among Spanish adults with COPD is favorable, 
     although there is much room for improvement. Insufficient PA is more 
     prevalent in these patients than in the general population. Sex 
     differences were found, with significantly more frequent PA among 
     males with COPD.]

     AB: Abstract. Rationale. The association between self-report falling 
     risk in persons with COPD and hospitalization has not been previously 
     explored. Objective. To examine whether self-reported risk is 
     associated with hospitalizations in patients with COPD. Methods. A 
     secondary analysis from a prospective observational cohort study of 
     veterans with COPD. Participants completed questions from the 
     Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths and Injuries (STEADI) tool kit at 
     either baseline or at the end of the 12-month study. A prospective or 
     cross-sectional analysis examined the association between responses 
     to the STEADI questions and risk of all-cause or COPD 
     hospitalizations. Results. Participants (N = 388) had a mean age of 
     69.6 ± 7.5 years, predominately male (96 %), and 144 (37.1 %) 
     reported having fallen in the last year. More than half reported 
     feeling unsteady with walking (52.6 %) or needing to use their arms 
     to stand up from a chair (61.1 %). A third were concerned about 
     falling (33.3 %). Three questions were associated with all-cause (not 
     COPD) hospitalization in both unadjusted and adjusted cross-sectional 
     analysis (N = 213): "fallen in the past year" (IRR 1.77, 95 % CI 1.10 
     to 2.86); "unsteady when walking" (IRR 1.88, 95 % CI 1.14 to 3.10); 
     "advised to use a cane or walker" (IRR 1.89, 95 % CI 1.16 to 3.08). 
     Conclusions. The prevalence of self-reported falling risk was high in 
     this sample of veterans with COPD. The association between falling 
     risk and all-cause hospitalization suggests that non-COPD 
     hospitalizations can negatively impact intrinsic risk factors for 
     falling. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of 
     all-cause hospitalization on falling risk in persons with COPD.]

     AB: Abstract. Melatonin (MLT), the main product of the pineal gland, 
     is involved in muscle tissue repair and regeneration, besides several 
     other important physiologic functions. In COPD, MLT administration 
     can improve lung oxidative stress and sleep quality, but its 
     potential effects on the outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) 
     have not been previously investigated. A randomized controlled trial 
     was undertaken to test the hypothesis that a combined approach of 
     rehabilitative exercise training and MLT supplementation could 
     maximize functional performance, health status and quality of life in 
     patients with COPD. Thirty-nine individuals with COPD referred to a 
     supervised PR program at the Federal University of Ceara, Brazil, 
     were randomized to receive MLT (3 mg/day; n = 18) or placebo (n = 
     21). Exercise capacity (6-min walk test - 6MWT), health status (COPD 
     assessment test), and quality of life (airways questionnaire 20) were 
     investigated as primary outcomes. No differences were observed at 
     baseline in demographic, anthropometric and clinical characteristics 
     between MLT and placebo groups. At the end of PR, superiority of the 
     MLT group was demonstrated in improvement in the distance covered in 
     the 6MWT (71 ± 26 vs. 25 ± 36 m; p < 0.01), health status (−11 ± 6 
     vs. −3 ± 5; p < 0.01), and quality of life (−6.9 ± 3.0 vs. −1.9 ± 
     2.4; p < 0.01), compared to the placebo group. In conclusion, MLT 
     supplementation during the course of 12 weeks of PR can improve 
     functional capacity, health status and quality of life in patients 
     with COPD. These findings may have significant implications for the 
     management of this condition.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Wearing facemasks in public is effective in 
     preventing viral transmission. However, no study has evaluated the 
     impact of wearing facemasks during exercise on dyspnea in patients 
     with chronic pulmonary infections from multifaceted aspects, 
     including sensory qualities and emotional responses. The aim of this 
     study was to evaluate facemask-related dyspnea during exercise in 
     this patient population. Methods. We conducted a randomized crossover 
     study involving adult patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial 
     pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) or bronchiectasis who participated in 
     exercise sessions, both with (mask-on) and without (mask-off) 
     surgical facemasks. The sensory and emotional dimensions of dyspnea 
     during each exercise session were assessed using the Multidimensional 
     Dyspnea Profile. Statistical analyses were performed to identify 
     factors associated with worsening scores for each dimension. Results. 
     Thirty-four patients (mean age [standard deviation]: 71.6 [8.6] 
     years) were included in the analysis. The median [interquartile 
     range] total scores for the sensory and emotional dimensions of 
     dyspnea were 3.5 [1, 9.5] (mask-off) vs. 10 [5.5, 23.8] (mask-on) (P 
     < 0.001) and 0 [0, 5] (mask-off) vs. 3 [0.8, 10.3] (mask-on) (P = 
     0.115), respectively. "Air hunger" was the primary sensory descriptor 
     of mask-related dyspnea. Vital capacity (VC) < 80% of the predicted 
     value was a significant risk factor for worsening sensory dimension 
     scores when wearing masks (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 5.5 
     [1.16-26.1], P = 0.038). Conclusions. The findings of this study 
     indicate that patients with NTM-PD or bronchiectasis, particularly 
     those with VC <80% of the predicted value, are likely to experience 
     the sensory dimension of dyspnea during exercise while wearing 
     surgical facemasks.]

     SRMR = 0.042). The Cronbach's alpha was 0.909, and the test-retest 
     reliability was 0.966, with good internal consistency and stability. 
     The content validity index of the items ranged from 0.83 to 1.00, 
     while the content validity index of the scale was 0.96. The 
     correlation between the C-SSDLAOA and GSES was 0.886, with good 
     concurrent validity. Conclusions. The C-SSDLAOA is a reliable and 
     valid instrument for assessing self-efficacy for daily life 
     activities in Chinese community-dwelling older adults.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
     the effects of 12 weeks of resistance training (RT) with progressive 
     intensity on factors associated with sarcopenia in older individuals. 
     Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 74 participants 
     (64.27 ± 7.06-y-old) who were divided into a control group (n = 37) 
     and an intervention group (n = 37). The intervention group underwent 
     12 weeks of RT three times a week, with an initial training of 60% 
     and final training of 85% of one-repetition maximum (1RM). Both 
     groups were evaluated before and after the 12-week training period to 
     assess improvements in strength and physical performance. Results. 
     The intervention group showed an increase in physical performance, as 
     evidenced by a reduction in the time to perform the Timed Up and Go 
     (TUG) test (p < 0.01) and the Five Times Sit to Stand Test (p < 
     0.01). Furthermore, the RT proved to be efficient for increasing hand 
     grip and overall muscular strength, as confirmed through the 1RM 
     test. However, the muscle mass index (MMI) and walking speed did not 
     show any significant alterations in both groups. Conclusions. In 
     conclusion, 12 weeks of RT with progressive intensity has a positive 
     effect on the diagnostic parameters of sarcopenia, leading to 
     improvements in physical performance and muscular strength while 
     maintaining the MMI.]

     AB: Abstract. The present study aimed to assess caregiver 
     satisfaction with a telerehabilitation program and remote monitoring 
     for older adults with dementia and their caregivers during the 
     COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify the factors influencing 
     caregiver satisfaction. This study adopted a mixed-methods approach 
     and was part of a randomized clinical trial, with blinded assessors, 
     comprising two groups: the. Intervention: Group (IG) receiving a 
     telerehabilitation program involving standardized physical exercises 
     for older adults with dementia, along with caregiver guidelines for 
     the caregiver; and the Control Group (CG) receiving remote 
     monitoring. At baseline, factors related to older adults with 
     dementia and their caregivers were measured. After 12 weeks, 
     caregiver satisfaction with the interventions was assessed. The final 
     sample consisted of 64 pairs of family caregivers and older people 
     with dementia. Caregivers in the IG showed higher satisfaction levels 
     with the intervention, Internet-based treatment, and healthcare 
     received compared to caregivers in the CG. Both groups expressed 
     positive views towards the treatment, with excellent ratings for 
     audio and video quality, and a preference for Internet-based 
     treatment over face-to-face. In the IG, only the amount of time 
     dedicated to caregiving influenced satisfaction with the 
     intervention, whereas in the CG, cognitive and functional performance 
     of the older people influenced satisfaction with remote monitoring. 
     Our findings suggest the potential of the program in providing 
     effective care for older people with dementia and their caregivers.]

     AB: Abstract. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an 
     online multicomponent physical exercise intervention (MPE) on the 
     physical performance (PP) of older adults. A randomized controlled 
     trial was conducted, with 110 participants assigned to either the MPE 
     group or the control group. The MPE group engaged in endurance, 
     strength, balance, and flexibility exercises for at least three days 
     per week, while the control group received educational sessions. PP 
     was evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at 
     baseline and after three months. The intervention group showed a mean 
     increase over control group of 0.81 points on the SPPB scale (95% 
     confidence interval [CI] 0.23-1.40; p=0.000) and in the tandem 
     balance test with 1.26 more seconds (95% CI 0.21-2.31; p=0.019). 
     These findings suggest that the online MPE intervention is effective 
     in enhancing the PP of community-dwelling older adults, which may 
     contribute to a reduction in functional dependence among this 
     population.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The need for dyadic intervention is 
     enhanced with increasing numbers of older adults with dementia. 
     Studies have shown that sensory art therapies are essential for 
     dementia patients and their caregivers. The effects of dyadic sensory 
     art therapies for people with dementia and their caregivers require 
     further exploration. Objectives. This review aimed to assess the 
     efficacy of dyadic sensory art therapies on neuropsychiatric symptoms 
     and mental function for dementia patients, caregiver burden and 
     psychological state for caregivers, dyad relationship quality for 
     dyads, and evaluate the potential effects of dyadic sensory art 
     therapies on quality of life for both dementia patients and 
     caregivers. Methods. An electronic literature search of the PubMed, 
     EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and three 
     Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang and CBM) was conducted up to 
     November 2022. Two reviewers (SZ and QG) worked independently to 
     identify relevant studies. Risk of bias was assessed by the 
     Cochrane's and Joanna Briggs Institute's tool. Meta-analyses were 
     conducted using RevMan software 5.4. Results. This systematic review 
     included 15 studies (7 RCTs and 8 quasi-experimental studies). The 
     meta-analysis showed that dyadic sensory art therapies significantly 
     ameliorated neuropsychiatric symptoms (SMD = −0.90, 95% CI −1.61 to 
     −0.20, P = .01), caregiver burden (SMD = −0.75; 95% CI −1.03 to 
     −0.47; P < .001). No significant improvements were found in caregiver 
     depression and quality of life for both patients and caregivers. 
     Conclusions. Dyadic sensory art therapies are generally effective at 
     ameliorating neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver burden. Future 
     studies are encouraged to design large-scale randomized controlled 
     trials with high-quality study to examine and confirm the 
     effectiveness of dyadic sensory art therapies for these dyads 
     composed of dementia patients and their caregivers.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Low back pain (LBP) disproportionately 
     affects older black adults, often leading to inadequate treatment due 
     to clinician biases. Objective pain measures are imperative, and 
     Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) shows promise for pain 
     detection. Aim. To determine the impact of listening to home-based 
     preferred web app-based music on underlying pain processing 
     mechanisms at the central nervous level in older black adults aged 
     ≥65 with LBP. Methods. Twenty older black adults with LBP listened to 
     preferred music twice daily for four days using the MUSIC CARE® app. 
     Neuroimaging data were collected using fNIRS. Data were transformed 
     to changes in oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations and 
     analyzed. Results. Significant cortical activation pattern 
     differences were observed between pre-and post-intervention scans, 
     particularly in somatosensory regions. Post-intervention scans showed 
     significantly reduced hemodynamic activities. Conclusion. Preferred 
     music listening has the potential to alleviate pain, and fNIRS 
     emerges as a promising tool for exploring cortical-level pain-related 
     neural circuits.]

     AB: Abstract. Previous research has suggested that community-based 
     service is beneficial in promoting older adults' life satisfaction. 
     However, there is limited knowledge of the mediating mechanisms that 
     foster this relationship. Thus, the current study aims to explore the 
     mediating role of psychological resilience in the association between 
     community-based service and life satisfaction among older adults. 
     Using data collected over four rounds of the Chinese Longitudinal 
     Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), this study analyzes the responses 
     of 1439 older adults in China. The results reveal that 
     community-based service is positively related to life satisfaction 
     among older adults. Furthermore, psychological resilience partially 
     mediates this association, highlighting its potential role in 
     promoting life satisfaction. These findings contribute to a deeper 
     theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying the 
     relationship between community-based service and older adults' life 
     satisfaction while offering practical implications for enhancing the 
     life satisfaction of older adults in China.]

     examined the effects of a prognostic training program on hospital 
     clinicians' knowledge and confidence in identifying older patients at 
     risk of dying. Methods. Fifty-seven clinicians from aged care 
     assessment teams at two Australian hospitals were introduced to the 
     Palliative Prognostic Index, a 5-item checklist indicating prognoses 
     between 3 and 6 weeks. Mixed-methods training evaluation included

     three months post-training. Results. Clinicians used a combination of 
     experience, knowledge, and intuition as strategies to generate 
     prognoses. Allied health staff relied on intuition more often than 
     medical and nursing staff. Prognostic tools were rarely used. 
     Pre-post-training comparisons showed significant improvements in 
     clinicians' knowledge and confidence in identifying signs of dying, 
     particularly amongst allied health. Follow-up interviews highlighted 
     advantages and challenges of using prognostic tools. Recommendations

     in fall prevention activities (confidence to manage fall risks [0-10 
     scale; 10 most confident] and adherence to fall prevention 
     recommendations). We recruited 200 patients (46.3% of eligible 
     patients), and 185 completed surveys. Participants reported high 
     confidence (range 7.48 to 8.23) in addressing their risks. Their 
     adherence to clinician recommendations was mixed (36.4% to 90.5%). We 
     nearly met our recruitment goals, and found that older adults are 
     confident to address their fall risks, but do not consistently engage

     In contrast, this study explores the existence and use of meaningful

     utterances of 20 PMLD participants were recorded and amplified. 
     Recordings were investigated for evidence of language content and 
     structure, listener intelligibility, and acoustic and phonetic 
     features relative to normal speech and whisper. Results. Language 
     content and structure was identified. Listener intelligibility was 
     demonstrated. Acoustic and phonetic features relative to normal 
     speech and whisper were evident. Conclusion. Twenty PMLD participants 
     produced meaningful SV language intelligible to listeners. This study 
     requires further robust research to fully confirm its findings but 
     highlights implications for clinical practice and for understanding 
     of PMLD communication competencies. This paper is accompanied by 
     audio samples and transcriptions of recorded utterances to 
     demonstrate the SV language produced by the participants. The quality 
     of the samples varies due to the difficulties in recording SV 
     utterances and the difficulties for participants in articulating 
     clearly. This is not normal speech, but it is normal language. The 
     listener may need to replay samples where the quality of the 
     recording is poor.]

     procedures. A sample of 867 individuals recruited using social media 
     in northeastern Brazil completed the following instruments: the 
     Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, Brazilian version), the 
     WHOQOL-Bref, and a sociodemographic form Outcomes and results. The 
     mean score for depression was significantly higher in the "children 
     with autism" group compared to the other groups. The mean anxiety 
     score was significantly higher in the "children with autism" and 
     "childless" groups. Mean QoL scores were lower in the "children with 
     autism" group compared to the other groups for all the domains, with 
     this difference being statistically significant compared with the 
     "children without mental problems" group for all the domains. 
     Conclusions and implications. Anxiety and depression symptoms were 
     greater and QoL scores were lower in parents of children with autism. 
     All groups benefitted from logistic support during the pandemic, 
     whereas having to care for others negatively impacted QoL.]

     affects the ability to acquire and make use of native language. 
     Possible underlying cognitive mechanisms are related to memory 
     functions. Aims. The aim was examination of the relationship between 
     visual short-term memory of objects as well as audiovisual short-term 
     memory, and particular nonverbal and language abilities. Methods and 
     procedures. The study included 7-9-year-old children with DLD and 
     matched control group. Participants completed the Language 
     Development Test, the Stanford-Binet IQ scale (SB5), and two 
     short-term memory tasks: immediate recall of the visually presented 
     pictograms and immediate recall of audiovisually presented sequences 
     of syllables. Outcomes and results. The results revealed diminished 
     levels of short-term visual memory for objects as well as audiovisual 
     memory in children with DLD. However, there were no group differences 
     in the control task of WM. Conclusions and implications. Results 
     supported the idea of diminished abilities in children with DLD to 
     perform mental operations on verbalizable visual objects. Importantly 
     non-verbal working memory ability, which cannot easily be supported 
     by verbal representations, is at typical levels. This suggests that 
     verbalization ability should be taken into account in the assessment 
     of seemingly non-verbal cognitive functions among children with DLD.]

     challenges they face are imperative to inform clinical care. Aim. To 
     understand how DCD affects daily life from adolescents living with 
     the disorder. Methods. Participants were recruited from a database of 
     adolescents who were formally diagnosed with DCD in childhood. 
     Nineteen semi-structured interviews of adolescents with DCD (13-18 
     years) were conducted and analyzed using an interpretive description 
     approach. Results. Data analysis revealed four overarching themes: 
     (1) Through the years; (2) Standing out, left out, opting out; (3) 
     Rising into Resilience; and (4) Help me to be me. Adolescents with 
     DCD face challenges in physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and 
     mental health domains, but their success can be optimized through 
     provision of support, fostering social connections, the use of 
     strategies, and increasing public understanding. Few services 
     currently exist for adolescents with DCD, as treatment is not 
     standard of care. Conclusions and implications. Insights gained from 
     this study provide client-centred evidence to advocate for 
     intervention for adolescents with DCD, and guide recommendations for 
     clinical care and community support to meet the needs of this 
     under-served population. What this paper adds? This paper 
     qualitatively explores the lived experience of adolescents with DCD, 
     adding to the limited research within this population. Expanding 
     beyond the typical focus of motor challenges, this paper highlights 
     the widespread influence of DCD on daily life, including in 
     cognitive, mental health, and social-emotional domains. Common 
     environmental contexts that exacerbate challenges during adolescent 
     years are explored, including high school PE class and electives, 
     learning to drive, beginning employment, and preparing for 
     post-secondary education. Through an interpretive description 
     methodology, this paper delves into clinical and practical solutions 
     to support adolescents with DCD, from an individualized and 
     client-centered perspective.]

     AB: Abstract. Aims. The aims of this study were to assess the 
     health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adult Bahraini patients 
     with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and to explore factors associated 
     with poor HRQoL. Methods. Cross-sectional HRQoL data were obtained 
     from a sample of patients in active treatment for DFU at a large 
     public hospital in Bahrain. Patient-reported HRQOL was measured using 
     the following instruments: DFS-SF, CWIS and EQ-5D. Results. The 
     patient sample included 94 patients, with a mean age of 61.8 (SD: 
     9.9) years, 54 (57.5%) were males, and 68 (72.3%) were native 
     Bahrainis. Poorer HRQoL was found among patients who were unemployed, 
     divorced/widowed, and those with a shorter duration of formal 
     education. Additionally, patients with severe DFUs, persisting 
     ulcers, and a longer duration of diabetes reported statistically 
     significantly poorer HRQoL. Conclusions. Findings from this study 
     demonstrate a low level of HRQoL among Bahraini patients with DFUs. A 
     longer duration of diabetes, in addition to ulcer severity and status 
     statistically significantly influence HRQoL.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective, To investigate knowledge, attitude and 
     practice of screening pre-ulcerative lesions among endocrinology 
     healthcare workers. Methods, A new questionnaire was developed and 
     distributed online and 1004 valid questionnaires were returned. 
     T-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple linear 
     regression were used for statistical analysis. Results. A total of 
     1100 questionnaires were returned, and 96 were excluded. The scores 
     of endocrinology healthcare workers' knowledge, attitude, and 
     practice for screening for pre-ulcerative lesions were 45.46 ± 16.26, 
     92.11 ± 10.50, and 72.27 ± 17.63 respectively. 60.2% participants had 
     been trained to screen for pre-ulcerative lesions, but 39.8% had not 
     been trained. 31.8% of healthcare professionals claimed that their 
     hospital did not have a screening project for pre-ulcer diabetic foot 
     lesions. Positive relationships were found between knowledge and 
     practice and between attitude and practice. Multiple linear 
     regression analysis showed that: level II hospital and tertiary 
     hospital were the main factors influencing the knowledge scores; 
     Undergraduate and participating in relevant training were the main 
     factors influencing the attitude scores; participating in relevant 
     training, hospital conducts relevant projects, and patient 
     cooperation, and working hours were the main factors influencing the 
     practice score. Conclusions. Endocrinology healthcare workers need 
     more knowledge regarding pre-ulcerative lesions, and their screening 
     practices need to be strengthened. Increased education and training 
     for pre-ulcerative lesion screening should be implemented among 
     healthcare workers in endocrinology departments.]

     AB: Abstract. Aims. Previous research suggested that diabetic foot 
     ulcer (DFU) location could affect transcutaneous oxygen pressure 
     (TcPO2) values following the angiosome concept. Up to our knowledge 
     no studies have yet analyzed if the location of a diabetic foot ulcer 
     can be a confounding factor that modifies TcPO2 values. The primary 
     aim of this study was to compare the potential healing prognosis of 
     TcPO2 differentiated for diabetic foot ulcers in different angiosome 
     locations. Methods. A 2-years observational cohort prospective study 
     was performed in 81 patients with diabetic foot ulcers. 
     Transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurements were performed at 
     baseline by placing the electrode on two different angiosomes: dorsal 
     zone of the foot (dorsalis pedis angiosome) and between the navicular 
     bone and the tibial malleolus (posterior tibial angiosome). The main 
     outcome was establishing the effectiveness of TcPO2 measurements 
     (dorsalis pedis angiosome and posterior tibial angiosome) for 
     predicting DFU healing. Results. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure probe 
     placed in the dorsum of the foot (dorsalis pedis angiosome) yielded a 
     sensitivity (S) of 95 % and specificity (SP) of 73 %, and an area 
     under the curve (AUC) of 0.902 (p < 0.001 [0.84-0.96]) for ulcers 
     located in the forefoot and toes; while TcPO2 placed in the posterior 
     tibial angiosome yielded an S of 100 % and SP of 85 % and an AUC of 
     0.894 (p < 0.001 [0-822-0.966]) for DFU located in the midfoot and 
     heel. Conclusion. This study suggests that angiosome-guided TcPO2 
     contributes to a prognosis of successful foot ulcer healing.]

     AB: Abstract. Aims. To investigate the cross-sectional association 
     between deep and superficial diabetic neuropathy, postural impairment 
     assessed by wearable inertial sensors, and the risk of fall among 
     patients with diabetic foot. Methods. Diabetic patients attending a 
     University Podiatric Clinic were evaluated for the presence of deep 
     and superficial peripheral neuropathy in sensory tests. Postural 
     impairment was assessed using a wearable inertial sensor, and the 
     evaluation of balance/gait and risk of fall was determined by the 
     Tinetti Scale and Downton Index, respectively. Glycemic control was 
     measured by glycated haemoglobin concentration and fasting glycaemia. 
     The postural parameters measured were the anteroposterior and 
     medio-lateral sway of the center of mass (CoM) and the sway area 
     (area traveled by the CoM per second). The results were analyzed 
     through a logistic regression model to assess those posture variables 
     mostly significantly associated with neuropathy and risk of fall 
     scales. Results. A total of 85 patients were evaluated. Spearman's 
     rank correlation coefficients showed a strong and significant 
     relationship (p < 0.05) between deep diabetic neuropathy assessed by 
     Semmes-Weinstein monofilament, diapason and biothensiometer and 
     postural alterations, whereas no significant correlations between 
     superficial (painful sensitivity) neuropathy and the postural 
     parameters. The sway path of the displacement along the 
     anterior-posterior axis recorded during tests performed with eyes 
     open and feet close together were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated 
     with a poor glycemic (glycated haemoglobin concentration) control and 
     each other with all diabetic neuropathy tests, fall risk scales, 
     muscular weakness, ankle joint limitation and history of ulcers. 
     Conclusions. The results support the existence of a strong 
     association between alterations of the deep somato-sensitive pathway 
     (although depending on the tool used to measure peripheral 
     neuropathy), glycemic control and balance impairments assessed using 
     a wearable sensors. Wearable-based postural analysis might be part of 
     the clinical assessment that enables the detection of balance 
     impairments and the risk of fall in diabetic patients with diabetic 
     peripheral neuropathy.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Deciding whether to transition to wound 
     palliation is challenging for health care professionals because there 
     is no agreed definition or understanding of palliative wound care, 
     including the goals, core elements and differences from general wound 
     management. Objectives. To conduct a scoping review with qualitative 
     synthesis to define palliative wound care in terms of its conceptual 
     framework, goals, principles, components, and differences from 
     general wound management, and provide a new definition of palliative 
     wound care based on this scoping review. Eligibility criteria. 
     Published literature that refers to the definitions, concept, goals 
     and core elements of palliative wound care using any methodological 
     approach, without any time limits, published in English. Sources of 
     evidence. The searches were conducted in CINAHL Complete via Ebsco, 
     Medline via Ovid, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar. 
     Charting methods. A data extraction form was developed by the review 
     team and used independently for data charting purposes. Braun and 
     Clarke's six phases of thematic analysis guided the qualitative 
     synthesis. Results. A total of 133 publications met the inclusion 
     criteria. Three main themes were developed to define palliative wound 
     care and understand its differences from general wound management: 1- 
     Healing potential of wounds and patient vulnerability, 2- 
     Understanding the impact on individuals and family to address needs, 
     3- Towards new goals and perspectives in approach to care. 
     Conclusions. Palliative wound care focuses on symptom management, 
     comfort, and dignity, but does not always target the healing of the 
     wound, which is the goal of general wound care. The needs of the 
     individual and their family must be addressed by clinicians through 
     the provision of care and support that takes into account the true 
     meaning of living and dying with a palliative wound.]

     AB: Abstract. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) lead to 
     fatigue and decreased productivity in workers, resulting in the need 
     for many affected individuals to seek medical treatment annually. 
     Beekeepers, like other agricultural workers, are susceptible to 
     WRMSDs due to the continuous demands of their work and the repetitive 
     movements involved. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine 
     the prevalence of WRMSDs and assess the level of risk associated with 
     different postures among beekeepers to improve their musculoskeletal 
     health. To achieve this, a cross-sectional study was conducted 
     involving 33 beekeepers, consisting of two stages. Firstly, the 
     Nordic Questionnaire was utilized to assess the prevalence of WRMSDs. 
     Subsequently, the Ovako Working Posture. Analysis: System (OWAS) was 
     employed to analyze and categorize the riskiest postures into four 
     levels of corrective measures. The findings indicate that the most 
     commonly affected areas were the back (51.5%) and waist (45.4%). The 
     occurrence of WRMSDs in various body regions was significantly 
     associated with the beekeepers' years of experience and weekly 
     working hours. Additionally, the prevalence of neck and back pain was 
     significantly related to their body mass index (BMI). The OWAS 
     postural analysis revealed that the back (36.75%) and arm (21.08%) 
     regions required corrective measures as soon as possible (level III), 
     while the back (26.47%) and legs (14.70%) fell under the category of 
     corrective measures needed in the near future (level II). Combining 
     the postural analysis results, 28.43% were classified as Action 
     Levels (AL) II, 37.73% as level III, and 0.98% as level IV. This 
     study demonstrates that WRMSDs are relatively common among 
     beekeepers, primarily due to their extensive work experience and the 
     adoption of awkward postures during their tasks. As a result, 
     recommendations regarding ergonomics and physiotherapy are provided 
     to alleviate pain and reduce the strain on critical postures.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. To investigate the influence of wrist 
     position and torque level on lower arm flexor muscle fatigue. 
     Background. Work-related musculoskeletal health risks at the wrist 
     joint may depend on joint position and torque level, as proposed by 
     ergonomic workplace assessment tools. As empirical data are scarce, 
     muscle fatigue, as proxy of work-related musculoskeletal health 
     risks, can be used to explore this assumption. Method. 18 healthy 
     participants performed fatiguing isometric wrist flexion contractions 
     in three wrist positions (40° flexion, 0° neutral position, and 40° 
     extension) and torque levels (10, 20, 40% of the maximum voluntary 
     contraction). Electromyographic signs of fatigue were analyzed in the 
     flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) 
     muscles. Results. Muscle fatigue was dependent on torque level and 
     wrist position and differed between muscles. Signs of fatigue were 
     more evident at higher torque levels for both muscles. While fatigue 
     signs in FCR were not clearly associated with wrist position, the FDS 
     fatigued more during wrist flexion. An interaction effect between 
     torque level and wrist position was not observed. Conclusion. Higher 
     torque levels induce greater signs of local muscle fatigue in wrist 
     flexor muscles, and a 40° wrist flexion triggers fatigue, while 40° 
     wrist extension does not. Our data do not support the assumption of 
     increased risk in greater wrist angles in any direction by prevailing 
     ergonomic risk assessments. Relevance to industry. People with 
     work-related wrist flexor effort may be at increased risk of 
     musculoskeletal disorders when higher torques are applied and flexed 
     wrist positions are required.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. The adult social care outcomes toolkit 
     (ASCOT) measures social care-related quality of life (SCRQoL) using 
     self-completion questionnaires and interviews. Many care home 
     residents find such methods inaccessible, leading to a reliance on 
     proxy-reporting. This study aimed to establish the psychometric 
     properties of the mixed-methods toolkit [ASCOT-Care Homes, 4 outcome 
     (CH4)] for measuring SCRQoL when residents cannot self-report. 
     Methods. Two cross-sectional, mixed-methods studies were undertaken 
     in care homes for older people in England between 2015 and 2020. We 
     used the ASCOT-CH4 (observation, and interviews with residents and 
     proxies) to collect information about SCRQoL and collected additional 
     data on residents' needs and characteristics, and variables 
     hypothesised to be related to SCRQoL. Hypothesis testing was applied 
     to establish construct validity, Cronbach's alpha for internal 
     consistency and exploratory factor analysis for structural validity. 
     Results. The combined dataset included 475 residents from 54 care 
     homes (34 nursing, 20 residential). Half had a diagnosis of dementia. 
     Less than a third of residents were able to complete an ASCOT 
     interview. Observations and proxy interviews informed researcher 
     ratings, meaning there were no missing ASCOT-CH4 scores. ASCOT-CH4 
     was found to be a weak unidimensional scale, consistent with other 
     ASCOT measures, with acceptable internal consistency (α = 0.77, 8 
     items). Construct validity was supported by the findings. 
     Conclusions. The ASCOT-CH4 is an alternative to conventional 
     proxy-questionnaires for measuring the SCRQoL of care home residents, 
     with good psychometric properties. A limitation is that users need a 
     range of data collection skills. Future research should explore 
     whether findings are replicable when data are collected by other 
     researchers.]

     biomarkers captured by a wrist-worn device can predict injurious 
     falls in older people and to develop a multivariable injurious fall 
     prediction model. Design. Population-based longitudinal cohort study. 
     Setting and participants. Community-dwelling participants of the UK 
     Biobank study aged 65 and older (n = 32,619) in the United Kingdom. 
     Methods. Participants were assessed at baseline on daily-life walking 
     speed, quality, quantity and distribution using wrist-worn 
     accelerometers for up to 7 days. Univariable and multivariable Cox 
     proportional hazard regression models were used to analyse the 
     associations between these parameters and injurious falls for up to 9 
     years. Results. Five percent of the participants (n = 1,627) 
     experienced at least one fall requiring medical attention over a mean 
     of 7.0 ± 1.1 years. Daily-life walking speed, gait quality, quantity 
     of walking and distribution of daily walking were all significantly 
     associated with the incidence of injurious falls (P < 0.05). After 
     adjusting for sociodemographics, lifestyle factors, comorbidities, 
     handgrip strength and reaction time; running duration, total step 
     counts and usual walking speed were identified as independent and 
     significant predictors of falls (P < 0.01). These associations were 
     consistent in those without a history of previous fall injuries. In 
     contrast, step regularity was the only risk factor for those with a 
     previous fall history after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions. 
     Daily-life gait speed, quantity and quality, derived from wrist-worn 
     sensors, are significant predictors of injurious falls in older 
     people. These digital gait biomarkers could potentially be used to 
     identify fall risk in screening programs and integrated into fall 
     prevention strategies.]

     on receipt of referrals, at assessment and into appropriately matched 
     interventions. To mitigate insufficient staff recruitment and 
     retention, participants proposed return-to-practice streams, 
     apprenticeship schemes, university engagement, combined 
     acute-community rotations and improving job description 
     advertisements. To reduce effects of fear avoidance behaviour on 
     rehabilitation, participants proposed the use of patient-specific 
     goals, patient and carer education, staff education in psychological 
     strategies or community psychologist access. Process mapping of one 
     London borough identified points of care where suggested 
     interventions to overcome barriers were in place and/or could be 
     implemented. Conclusion. physiotherapists propose that effective 
     provision of community physiotherapy following hip fracture could be 
     improved by refining care coordination, utilising stratification 
     techniques, employing enhanced recruitment and retainment strategies 
     and addressing fear avoidance behaviours.]

     AB: Abstract. Acute rhabdomyolysis (AR) leading to acute kidney 
     injury has many underlying etiologies, however, when the primary 
     trigger is exercise, the most usual underlying cause is either a 
     genetic muscle disorder or unaccustomed intense exercise in a healthy 
     individual. Three adult men presented with a history of exercise 
     intolerance and episodes of acute renal impairment following intense 
     exercise, thought to be due to AR in the case of two, and dehydration 
     in one. The baseline serum CK was mildly raised between attacks in 
     all three patients and acutely raised during attacks in two of the 
     three patients. Following referral to a specialized neuromuscular 
     centre, further investigation identified very low serum urate (<12 
     umol/L). In all three men, genetic studies confirmed homozygous 
     mutations in SLC2A9, which encodes for facilitated glucose 
     transporter member 9 (GLUT9), a major regulator of urate homeostasis. 
     Hereditary hypouricaemia should be considered in people presenting 
     with acute kidney injury related to intense exercise. Serum urate 
     evaluation is a useful screening test best undertaken after 
     recovery.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Children and young people living in and 
     leaving care are known to have experienced significant childhood 
     adversity and trauma resulting in potentially deleterious impact on 
     their health and well-being across the life course. Studies point to 
     the complex needs of this population who may benefit from allied 
     health professional (AHP)-related support with limited studies 
     located. This review sought to address this gap by systematically 
     scoping empirical literature focused on the provision of AHP support 
     to this cohort of children and young adults to assist an 
     understanding of the service needs for this vulnerable population. 
     Methods. This scoping review followed Arskey and O'Malley's five 
     steps framework (2005) to identify and review relevant literature. A 
     focus on identifying the evidence, challenges and gaps in research 
     relating to AHP support for children and young people living in and 
     leaving care was initially agreed, followed by a systematic search 
     using a combination of three key concepts to identify relevant 
     studies in five AHP disciplinary areas to identify best evidence in 
     the past decade (2011-2021). Study inclusion criteria were based on 
     empirical studies of children and young people living in care (0-17 
     years) and leaving care (18-25 years). A data extraction table was 
     formulated as a means of charting the data, aligned with the scope 
     and objectives of this review. Finally, data were subsequently 
     collated, synthesised and reported based on key thematic areas 
     emerging from included studies regarding AHP support to children and 
     young people living in and leaving care. Results. A total of 13 
     studies met the review inclusion criteria. Included studies reported 
     specifically on speech and language therapist (SLT; n = 5), 
     occupational therapist (OT; n = 3) and arts-based therapies (n = 5). 
     No studies were identified with regard to the use of physiotherapy 
     and dietetics with this population. Results indicated that children 
     and young people living in and leaving care have high rates of 
     speech, language, communication and sensory needs. More rigorous 
     screening, assessment and early intervention were identified as 
     essential for this vulnerable group. Increased multidisciplinary 
     collaboration and OT support for young adults in preparation for 
     transition to independent living was identified as an urgent 
     requirement. Included studies indicate promising results in relation 
     to access to arts-based therapies with particular reference to 
     identity formation for children and young people living in and 
     leaving care. Conclusions. Although evidence of effectiveness remains 
     limited, AHP service provision (specifically speech and language 
     therapy, occupational therapy and arts-based therapies) has the 
     potential to contribute positively to addressing the complex and 
     interacting needs of this vulnerable population. As a result, it is 
     recommended that AHP service provision is integrated into the 
     collaborative, multidisciplinary care available to children living in 
     and leaving care. More extensive, higher quality research related to 
     the benefits of AHP provision for this population of children and 
     young people is essential to provide a more robust evidence base 
     across the various professional disciplines that constitute allied 
     health provision.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Increasingly, health services are adopting 
     short-term consultative therapy models, such as single session 
     therapy, to cope with increased service demands, finite budgets and 
     changing consumer expectations. Within the paediatric sub-specialty 
     of child development and behaviour, allied health clinicians are 
     central to supporting families to understand their children, provide 
     therapeutic interventions and help achieve optimal developmental and 
     health outcomes. This study aimed to describe parents'/caregivers' 
     engagement during advanced allied health consultations utilizing a 
     single session therapy framework for managing neurodevelopmental and 
     behavioural concerns in children. Methods. Between March to June 
     2021, 14 parents participated in a qualitative study involving focus 
     groups. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to code and interpret 
     the data to understand and explore families' engagement in single 
     session therapy. Results. Three overarching themes relating to 
     parents' engagement during consultations emerged from the data: 
     connection with the clinician, parental attributes and organizational 
     influences. Clinician connection was the prominent construct that 
     enhanced parent attributes and the positive perception of the 
     organization in an ongoing manner. There was a complex interplay 
     between the behavioural and affective components of the clinician, 
     parents and the organization to create mutual presence, valued time, 
     understanding and action. Conclusions. This study demonstrates the 
     importance of clinician connection, parental attributes and 
     organizational influences to enhance engagement in therapeutic 
     consultations. These factors are interrelated and are a complex blend 
     of behaviour and internal states and highly individualized for each 
     family. Understanding how services can continue to engage families is 
     integral to ongoing sustainability and overall health and 
     well-being.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The aims of the present umbrella review 
     were (a) to summarize the available evidence on the effectiveness of 
     mobile applications aimed at increasing physical activity; (b) to 
     analyse the effect of an increase in physical activity on 
     kinanthropometric variables, body composition and physical fitness of 
     adolescents aged 12-16 years old; and (c) to determine the strengths 
     and limitations of the interventions carried out with adolescents 
     aged 12-16 years old through the use of mobile applications, to 
     provide recommendations for future research. Methods. The most 
     relevant inclusion criteria were (a) adolescents aged 12-16 years 
     old; (b) interventions carried out only with mobile apps; (c) 
     pre-post measurements; (d) participants without illnesses or 
     injuries; and (e) interventions lasting more than 8 weeks. The 
     databases used to identify the systematic reviews were the Web of 
     Science, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus. Two reviewers 
     independently used the AMSTAR-2 scale to measure the methodological 
     quality of the included reviews and also carried out an analysis of 
     external validity, with a third reviewer participating in the cases 
     in which consensus was not reached. Results. A total of 12 systematic 
     reviews were included (these included a total of 273 articles that 
     used electronic devices, of which 22 studies exclusively used mobile 
     applications with adolescents aged 12-16). Regarding physical 
     activity and its effect on body composition, kinanthropometric 
     variables and physical fitness, no significant differences were found 
     for any of the variables analysed, and the results were not 
     sufficiently consistent to determine the influence of these 
     interventions. Conclusions. It is important to highlight that the 
     scientific research conducted so far showed that mobile applications 
     were not effective in increasing physical activity and changing the 
     kinanthropometric variables, body composition or physical fitness of 
     adolescents. Thus, future research with stronger methodological 
     rigour and larger samples is needed to provide stronger evidence.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The efficacy of structured physical 
     exercise (SPE) has been examined in empirical studies to treat 
     attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This review aimed 
     (i) to systematically review and quantify the effects of SPE on ADHD 
     symptomology and executive function (primary outcomes) and on 
     physical health, physical fitness and mental health issues (secondary 
     outcomes) in children/adolescents with ADHD; (ii) to evaluate the 
     study quality and explore moderation of the effects of SPE; and (iii) 
     to summarize the design of SPE interventions. Methods. An extensive 
     literature search in the databases of PubMed, Web of Science and 
     EBSCOhost was conducted to identify eligible intervention studies for 
     meta-analysis. A descriptive account of the features of the studies 
     is provided, including assessment of risk/quality (ROB-2/ROBINS-I). 
     Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals 
     (CIs) were calculated with random effects models to compare 
     post-intervention effects. Results. A total of 18 studies were 
     included in the review. The majority of the studies examined the 
     effects of SPE lasting for 3-12 weeks. Assessment of bias/quality 
     indicated half of the included studies as high quality. The 
     meta-analysis (pooled n = 627) revealed that SPE had a positive 
     effect on primary and secondary outcomes, that is, inattention (SMD = 
     −1.79), executive function (SMD = 2.19), physical fitness (SMD = 
     1.39) and mental health issues (SMD = −0.89). Subgroup analysis 
     showed that long-term practice of SPE, featured/tailored SPE, 
     non-Chinese participants, taking methylphenidate and study with low 
     quality had larger effects. Conclusions. There is emerging evidence 
     that SPE is a promising option to enhance symptom management and 
     physical/mental health in children/adolescents with ADHD.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The COVID-19 pandemic and response changed 
     clinical service delivery and practice for speech and language 
     therapists (SLTs) in the United Kingdom. SLTs work with children with 
     neurodisability regarding both difficulties with their communication 
     and eating and drinking skills (oropharyngeal dysphagia). This survey 
     aimed to specifically explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
     SLT practice for school-aged children with dysphagia. Methods. 
     UK-based SLTs working with school-aged children with neurodisability 
     and oropharyngeal dysphagia were recruited to share their perceptions 
     on the impact of COVID-19 on practice. Four questions focusing on 
     COVID-19 impact were part of a larger online survey exploring SLT 
     clinical practice regarding mealtime management of children with 
     neurodisability and oropharyngeal dysphagia, which included 
     demographic information, service delivery, assessment and 
     intervention practices. COVID-19 impact questions were a mixture of 
     multiple choice and free text responses. The survey was disseminated 
     using professional networks and social media, between 14 May and 30 
     July 2021. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and 
     qualitative content analysis. Results. One hundred and two 
     participants answered at least one of the four COVID-19 questions. 
     Eighty-two per cent of SLTs either agreed or strongly agreed that 
     COVID-19 impacted on service delivery to children and families. 
     Negative impacts on service delivery included school 
     absences/closures, home visiting restrictions, families declining 
     input and/or having barriers to telehealth use and the impact of mask 
     wearing on interactions. Positive impacts included increased 
     telehealth access and skills, increased contact with families and 
     focus on children's eating and drinking function within the home 
     environment. Participants aimed to maintain the increased contact 
     with families alongside a hybrid service delivery approach of 
     in-person and virtual appointments. Conclusions. This survey provides 
     novel information capturing SLT practice change across two waves of 
     COVID-19 and return to in-person practice for UK children with 
     neurodisability.]

     Questionnaire-Pediatric Rehabilitation (FNQ-PR) version and evaluate 
     the reliability and concurrent validity of this self-report measure 
     for caregivers of children with disabilities who receive pediatric 
     rehabilitation services. Materials/Methods. The 39-item FNQ-PR was 
     developed through a modified Delphi Technique. For test-retest 
     evaluation, parents completed the FNQ-PR twice through an online 
     REDCap survey, 1-3 weeks apart. Concurrent validity data 
     (parent-report Impact on Family Scale [IFS-15] and Measure of 
     Processes of Care [MPOC-20]) were collected at baseline. Reliability 
     analyses included ICCs (95%CI) and internal consistency evaluation. 
     Results. Twenty-five caregivers of children ages 2-18 years (mean age 
     12.2 years) with a disability completed the FNQ-PR at baseline, and 
     21 completed the retest. FNQ-PR total score demonstrated excellent 
     test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.84); internal consistency was high. 
     The FNQ-PR total score was strongly negatively associated with IFS-15 
     total score (r = −0.62) and showed fair to strong association with 
     MPOC subscale scores (0.45 ≤ r ≤ 0.70). Participants did not 
     identify issues with the online format or FNQ-PR item rating. 
     Conclusions. The FNQ-PR demonstrated excellent overall reliability 
     and strong evidence of validity. It fills a gap in clinical care of 
     families of children with disabilities, providing a systematic way 
     for families to identify the extent to which their needs are 
     perceived to have been met. Clinicians can use this tool to target 
     unmet needs that are most important to families. FNQ-PR use in future 
     research will support exploration of the impact of specific child and 
     family factors on family needs.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Impaired executive function is a core 
     symptom of cognitive impairment in atypical children. The purpose of 
     this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore the 
     effectiveness of interventions for exercise in real-life settings on 
     executive function in atypical children. Methods. This study searched 
     the CNKI, Wan-Fang, VIP, WOS, PubMed, Scopus and EBSCO databases. Two 
     researchers independently selected articles, extracted data and 
     assessed the risk of bias for the included studies. Exercise 
     activities were categorized into open and closed skills based on the 
     unpredictability of the environmental context and into sequential and 
     continuous skills based on the complexity of the movement structure. 
     Based on these two classifications, motor skills were categorized 
     into open-sequential (e.g. basketball), open-continuous (e.g. 
     obstacle running), closed-sequential (e.g. martial arts) and 
     closed-continuous (e.g. swimming) skills. The SPSS 25.0 and Stata 
     16.0 software were used for statistical analysis. Results. A total of 
     19 articles (23 studies) were included in the systematic review and 
     meta-analysis. The participants were 990 atypical children with 
     neurodevelopmental disorders. Physical exercise in real-world 
     settings had significant intervention effects on inhibitory control 
     (SMD = −0.592, P = 0.033), working memory (SMD = −0.473, P = 
     0.034) and cognitive flexibility (SMD = −0.793, P = 0.014) in 
     atypical children. Quantitative intervention characteristics and 
     motor skill types moderated the effect of exercise on promoting 
     executive function in atypical children. Overall, exercise for 30-50 
     min, three to seven times a week for less than 10 weeks is effective 
     in improving executive function in atypical children. Open skills and 
     sequential skills have a positive intervention effect on more 
     dimensions of executive function in atypical children. Conclusions. 
     Physical exercise in real-world settings has a positive intervention 
     effect on executive function in atypical children. We should design 
     interventions based on the personality traits of the subject and the 
     type of exercise they are interested in to better promote improved 
     executive function in atypical children.]

     intensity, but parents' perspectives on increased involvement remain 
     unclear. The objective of this study was to explore parents' 
     experiences partnering with physical therapists (PTs) to administer 
     early, intensive rehabilitation to their young children with cerebral 
     palsy (CP). Methods. Twelve mothers and one father of children 
     between 8 months and 3 years old with CP were interviewed. 
     Semistructured interviews were conducted before and after parents 
     partnered with a PT to deliver a 12 week activity-based intervention 
     targeting their child's lower extremities. The intervention occurred 
     in the child's home and in PT clinical sites. Interviews were audio 
     recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interpretive description was used 
     as the methodological framework. Results. The three themes were (1) 
     focus on maximizing the child's potential, (2) participation in 
     intensive rehabilitation is challenging, and (3) the importance of a 
     positive experience with therapy. Families discussed a number of 
     barriers and facilitators to participating in intensive 
     rehabilitation. Conclusions. These results provide considerations for 
     clinicians and researchers to facilitate meaningful engagement of

     important with increasing evidence for early, activity-based 
     interventions for young children with CP.]

     States. Results. Results of pre-installation and post-installation 
     naturalistic observations suggested that social interactions, the use 
     of STEM-related language and 21st century skills, including 
     confidence, increased after interacting with the installations. 
     Conclusions. While previous research on PLL projects has demonstrated 
     the efficacy of transforming public spaces into places for playful 
     learning, this research provides support that, even in private, 
     targeted settings, using a trauma-informed approach, children and 
     adolescents, can reap the benefits of playful learning.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. In recent years telehealth became a popular 
     and a rational health service delivery approach, especially amidst 
     multiple challenges posed while providing health care interventions 
     during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim. We synthesized available evidence 
     on telehealth for managing children with NDDs in the Asia-Pacific 
     region with the aim of identifying successful methods. Methodology. 
     We systematically reviewed six electronic databases: MEDLINE, AMED, 
     EMBASE, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and (CINAHL plus) using the 
     keywords and database-specific subject headings from their inception 
     to 25th August 2021. Review findings were synthesized narratively, 
     and harvest plots were used to demonstrate the effect of 
     interventions. The protocol and reporting the findings of this review 
     adhered to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PROSPERO registration: CRD 
     340690.Results. We harvested 30,823 records; 17,563 duplicates were 
     removed, and 196 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. 16 
     studies with multiple research designs were included in the review. 
     Eight were from the Pacific region and eight represented Asia. The 
     interventions targeted families and children with a variety of NDDs 
     (autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, cleft lip and palate, 
     hearing impairment, cerebral palsy etc.) via telehealth. Telehealth 
     packages consisted of direct and indirect methods of synchronous, 
     asynchronous, and hybrid approaches. All studies used parent-led 
     intervention strategies. Telehealth reported a positive effect in 
     7/16 studies while five showed a neutral effect. Conclusions. 
     According to published evidence telehealth for children with NDDs is 
     an evolving, evidence-based service facilitation modality in the 
     Asia-Pacific region, with only a few published randomized controlled 
     trials. The systematic review shows promising telehealth practices 
     emerging across the region despite the diversity in NDDs studied.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) 
     is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects children's occupational 
     performance and participation. It is known that the Covid pandemic 
     has adversely affected the whole world in many areas. We aim to 
     investigate the occupational performance and participation of 
     children with DCD before and during the COVID-19. Methods. Sixty-five 
     children aged 5-12 years included in the study were assessed by the 
     Canadian Measure of Occupational Performance and the Participation 
     and Environment Measure for Children and Youth. Results. 
     Statistically significant differences were detected in occupational 
     performance and satisfaction scores (p < 0.01). Additionally, except 
     for 'involvement in the home environment' (p > 0.05), there were 
     statistically significant differences in all other areas of 
     participation (p < 0.01). Conclusion. The occupational performance 
     and participation of children with DCD are impacted during COVID-19. 
     In addition, it is seen that the desire of families to change 
     regarding participation has increased due to COVID-19. It would be 
     beneficial to include strategies to improve these areas in the 
     rehabilitation processes.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. While the Veterans Health Administration 
     (VA) has long provided hospice care within VA community living 
     centers (CLCs, i.e. VA nursing homes), an increasing number of 
     Veterans are receiving hospice in VA-contracted community nursing 
     homes (CNHs). However, little data exist about the quality of 
     end-of-life (EOL) care provided in CNHs. The aim of this study was to 
     compare family ratings of the quality of EOL care provided to 
     Veterans receiving hospice in VA CLCs and VA-contracted CNHs. 
     Methods. We conducted a retrospective analysis of national data from 
     VA's electronic medical record and Bereaved Family Survey (BFS) for 
     Veterans who received hospice in VA CLCs or VA-contracted CNHs 
     between October 2021 and March 2022. The final sample included 1238 
     Veterans who died in either a CLC (n = 1012) or a CNH (n = 226) and 
     whose next-of-kin completed the BFS. Our primary outcome was the BFS 
     global rating of care received in the last 30 days of life. Secondary 
     outcomes included BFS items related to symptom management, 
     communication, emotional and spiritual support, and information about 
     burial and survivor benefits. We compared unadjusted and adjusted 
     proportions for all BFS outcomes between those who received hospice 
     in CLCs and CNHs. Results. The adjusted proportion of family members 
     who gave the best possible rating (a score of 9 or 10 out of a 
     possible 10) for the overall care received near EOL was more than 13 
     percentage points higher for Veterans who received hospice in VA CLCs 
     compared to VA-contracted CNHs. Our findings also revealed quality 
     gaps of even greater magnitude in specific EOL care-focused domains. 
     Conclusions. Our findings document inadequacies in the quality of 
     multiple aspects of EOL care provided to Veterans in CNH-based 
     hospice and illuminate the urgent need for policy and practice 
     interventions to improve this care.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Patient factors are known to contribute to 
     decision making and treatment of ankle fractures. The presence of 
     poor baseline mobility, diabetes, neuropathy, alcoholism, cognitive 
     impairment, inflammatory arthritis or polytrauma can result in a 
     higher risk of failure or complications. Limited evidence is 
     available on the optimum management for this challenging cohort of 
     patients herein described as complex ankle fractures. This UK 
     multicentre study assessed and evaluated the epidemiology of ankle 
     fractures complicated by significant comorbidity and patient factors 
     and use of specialist surgical techniques such as hindfoot nails 
     (HFN) / tibiotalarcalcaneal (TCC) nails and enhanced open reduction 
     and internal fixation (ORIF). Patients and Methods. A UK-wide 
     collaborative study was performed of adult distal AO43/AO44 
     fractures, associated with 1 or more of the patient factors listed 
     above. Primary outcomes included patient demographics, comorbidities, 
     surgical technique and implants. Secondary outcomes included surgical 
     complications and early post-operative weight bearing instructions. 
     Statistical analysis was performed to assess patient and fracture 
     characteristics on outcome, including propensity matching. Results. 
     One-thousand three hundred and sixty patients, with at least one of 
     the above complex factors, from 56 centres were included with a mean 
     age of 53.1 years. 90.2% (1227) patients underwent primary fixation 
     which included 78.9% (1073) standard open reduction internal 
     fixations (ORIF), 3.25% (43) extended ORIF and 8.1% (111) primary HFN 
     / TCC. Overall wound complications and thromboembolic events were 
     similar in the hindfoot nail group and the ORIF group (11.7% vs 
     10.7%). Wound complications were greater in diabetic patients versus 
     non-diabetic patients independent of fixation method (15.8% vs 9.0%). 
     After propensity matching for comorbidities and fracture type, 
     overall complications were lower in the hindfoot nail (11.8%) and 
     extended ORIF groups (16.7%), than the standard ORIF group (18.6%). 
     Conclusion. Only a minority of complex ankle fractures are treated 
     with specialised techniques (HFN/TCC or extended ORIF). Though more 
     commonly used in older and frail patients their perceived advantages 
     are often negated by a reluctance to bear weight early. These 
     techniques demonstrated a better complication profile to standard 
     ORIF but hindfoot nail with joint preparation for fusion was 
     associated with more complications than hindfoot nail for fixation.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. The aim of this study is to investigate 
     stiffness and the maximum load to failure values of single- and 
     double-screw fixation of oblique medial malleolus fractures using 
     partially threaded cancellous screws. Our hypothesis is that 
     single-screw fixation of medial malleolus fractures after SER 
     injuries provides similar stiffness when compared with double-screw 
     fixation. Design. Biomechanical study. Methods. Twelve composite 
     polyurethane synthetic right distal tibiae were used in the 
     experiment. Oblique fractures of the medial malleolus were created 
     with a band saw using a custom-made osteotomy guide to standardize 
     the cuts in all models. Bone models were randomly separated into two 
     groups and fixed with one (n = 6) or two (n = 6) 4.0 mm partially 
     threaded cancellous screws placed perpendicular to the fracture line. 
     These were tested by applying an offset axial tension at 10 mm/minute 
     up to maximum load displacement, defined as subsidence of the medial 
     malleolus fragment. Maximum load to failure was determined for the 
     groups at the point where the curve ceased to be linear and suffered 
     an inflection. Force versus displacement curves were obtained and 
     recorded. The student's t-test for independent samples was used to 
     compare stiffness (N / mm) and maximum load (N) between experimental 
     groups, with a p value of < 0.05. Results. There were no significant 
     differences in stiffness (p = 0.290) and maximum load (p = 0.191) 
     among the two fixation constructs. Mean stiffness was 62.26 (±SD 
     21.11) N/mm for double-screw fixation group and 48.24 (±SD 22.40) 
     N/mm for single-screw fixation group. Mean maximum load was 387.83 
     (±SD 115.78) N for double-screw fixation group and 306.64 (±SD 
     81.97) N for single-screw fixation group. Conclusion. Fixation with 
     one 4.0 mm partially threaded cancellous screw was not shown to be 
     biomechanically inferior to fixation with two 4.0 mm partially 
     threaded cancellous screws in an oblique fracture of the medial 
     malleolus, supporting previous clinical studies that have shown that 
     one screw is sufficient for fractures of the medial malleolus.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Distal femur fractures (DFF) are common, 
     especially in the elderly and high energy trauma patients. Lateral 
     locked osteosynthesis constructs have been widely used, however 
     non-union and implant failures are not uncommon. Recent literature 
     advocates for the liberal use of supplemental medial plating to 
     augment lateral locked constructs. However, there is a lack of 
     proprietary medial plate options, with some authors supporting the 
     use of repurposing expensive anatomic pre-contoured plates. The aim 
     of this study was to investigate the feasibility of an effective, 
     readily available medial implant option. Methods. A retrospective 
     analysis from January 2014 to August 2023 was performed on DFF 
     requiring revision open reduction internal fixation (rORIF) with 
     supplemental medial plating with a Large Fragment Locking Compression 
     Plate (LCP) T-Plate via a medial sub-vastus approach. The T-plate was 
     contoured and placed superior to the medial condyle. A combination of 
     4.5 mm cortical, 5 mm locking and/or 6.5 mm cancellous screws were 
     used, with oblique screw trajectories towards the distal lateral 
     cortex of the lateral condyle. The primary outcome was union rate. 
     Results. This technique was utilised on fifteen patients. The mean 
     age was 55±15 (range 23-81); 73 % of cases were male and the median 
     follow-up was 61 weeks (IQR 49-87). The two most common fracture 
     patterns were AO/OTA 33-C3 (n = 5) and 33-A3 (n = 4), and three 
     patients had open fractures. The union rate was 93 % (14/15), with a 
     median time to union of 29 weeks (IQR 18-49). There were two 
     complications: a deep infection requiring two debridements and 
     locally eluding antibiotic insertion, and a prominent screw requiring 
     removal; both patients achieved union. The median range of motion was 
     0° (IQR 0-5) of extension and 100° (IQR 90-120) of flexion. 
     Conclusion. Supplemental medial plating of DFF with a Large Fragment 
     LCP T-Plate is a feasible, safe, and economical option for rORIF. 
     Further validation on a larger scale is warranted, along with 
     considerations to developing a specific implant in line with these 
     principles.]

     and efficacy of blood flow restriction exercise (BFRE) on skeletal 
     muscle size, strength, and functional performance in individuals with 
     neurological disorders (ND). Methods. A literature search was 
     performed in PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase. Two researchers 
     independently assessed eligibility and performed data extraction and 
     quality assessments. Eligibility criteria: Study populations with ND, 
     BFRE as intervention modality, outcome measures related to safety or 
     efficacy. Results. Out of 443 studies identified, 16 were deemed 
     eligible for review. Three studies examined the efficacy and safety 
     of BFRE, one study focused on efficacy results, and 12 studies 
     investigated safety. Disease populations included spinal cord injury 
     (SCI), inclusion body myositis (sIBM), multiple sclerosis (MS), 
     Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. A moderate-to-high risk of bias 
     was presented in the quality assessment. Five studies reported safety 
     concerns, including acutely elevated pain and rating of perceived 
     exertion levels, severe fatigue, muscle soreness, and cases of 
     autonomic dysreflexia. Two RCTs reported a significant between-group 
     difference in physical function outcomes, and two RCTs reported 
     neuromuscular adaptations. Conclusion. BFRE seems to be a potentially 
     safe and effective training modality in individuals with ND. However, 
     the results should be interpreted cautiously due to limited quality 
     and number of studies, small sample sizes, and a general lack of 
     heterogeneity within and between the examined patient cohorts.]

     underlying working memory and inhibitory control in children with 
     overweight/obesity. Methods. A total of 67 children (10.00 ± 1.10 
     years) were randomized into an exercise or control group. 
     Electroencephalography (EEG)-based current density (μA/mm2) was 
     estimated using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic 
     tomography (sLORETA) during a working memory task (Delayed 
     non-matched-to-sample task, DNMS) and inhibitory control task 
     (Modified flanker task, MFT). In DNMS, participants had to memorize 
     four stimuli (Pokemons) and then select between two of them, one of 
     which had not been previously shown. In MFT, participants had to 
     indicate whether the centered cow (i.e. target) of five faced the 
     right or left. Results. The exercise group had significantly greater 
     increases in brain activation in comparison with the control group 
     during the encoding phase of DNMS, particularly during retention of 
     second stimuli in temporal and frontal areas (peak t = from 3.4 to 
     3.8, cluster size [k] = from 11 to 39), during the retention of the 
     third stimuli in frontal areas (peak t = from 3.7 to 3.9, k = from 15 
     to 26), and during the retention of the fourth stimuli in temporal 
     and occipital areas (peak t = from 2.7 to 4.3, k = from 13 to 101). 
     In MFT, the exercise group presented a lower current density change 
     in the middle frontal gyrus (peak t = −4.1, k = 5). No significant 
     change was observed between groups for behavioral performance (p ≥ 
     0.05). Conclusion. A 20-week exercise program modulates brain 
     activity which might provide a positive influence on working memory 
     and inhibitory control in children with overweight/obesity.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Walking pace is associated with various 
     health-related outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
     association between self-reported walking pace and the incidences of 
     diabetic microvascular complications among participants with type 2 
     diabetes (T2D). Methods. Self-reported walking pace was classified as 
     brisk, average, or slow. The outcomes were the incidences of diabetic 
     retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic nephropathy. COX 
     proportional hazards models adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, 
     and health-related factors were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) 
     and 95% CIs. Results. A total of 14 518 participants with T2D in the 
     UK Biobank (mean age 59.7 ± 7.0 years, 5028 [34.6%] women) were 
     included. During a median follow-up of 12.5 (interquartile range: 
     11.6-13.4) years, 2980 participants developed diabetic microvascular 
     complications. After adjusting for confounding factors, and compared 
     with brisk walkers, slow walkers had a multivariable-adjusted HR of 
     1.98 (95% CI 1.58, 2.47) for composite diabetic microvascular 
     complications, 1.54 (95% CI 1.11, 2.14) for diabetic retinopathy, 
     3.26 (95% CI 2.08, 5.11) for diabetic neuropathy, and 2.32 (95% CI 
     1.91, 2.82) for diabetic nephropathy. Average walking pace was 
     associated with a higher risk for diabetic nephropathy (HR 1.51, 95 
     CI% 1.27-1.79) compared with brisk walking. Additionally, ≥1 
     diabetic microvascular complication occurred in 447 (14.7%) of 
     participants with brisk walking pace, 1702 (19.5%) with average 
     walking pace, and 831 (30.4%) with slow walking pace. Time from study 
     recruitment to first diagnosis was shorter in participants who 
     reported a slow walking pace, compared with brisk or average walkers. 
     Among participants who had diabetic nephropathy as their first

     AB: Abstract. Most of the evidence on physical activity for 
     maintaining a healthy weight in adolescents is based solely on 
     aerobic physical activity alone, with little attention given to the 
     muscle strength component. This study aimed to investigate the 
     associations between aerobic activities and muscle-strengthening 
     activities (MSA) and overweight/obesity among a representative sample 
     of adolescents. Data from the United States-based Youth Risk Behavior 
     Surveillance System for the 2011-2019 cycle were used in this 
     cross-sectional study. Adolescents self-reported their adherence to 
     aerobic and MSA guidelines, as well as their height and weight. 
     Overweight and obesity were defined using the age- and sex-specific 
     criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with a 
     body mass index (BMI) ≥85th and ≥95th percentiles, respectively. 
     We examined the associations between adherence to physical activity 
     guidelines (reference: not meeting either of the physical activity 
     guidelines) and overweight/obesity or obesity using binary logistic 
     regressions. These analyses were adjusted for race/ethnicity, sex, 
     age, screen time, sleep duration, tobacco, alcohol, fruit, 
     vegetables, and soda consumption. A total of 42 829 adolescents 
     (48.98% girls) were included in the study. Of these, 22.23% met both 
     guidelines for physical activity, 30.47% had overweight/obesity, and 
     14.51% had obesity. Compared with meeting neither guideline, meeting 
     both aerobic and MSA guidelines was associated with lower odds of 
     having overweight/obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.64, 95% confidence 
     interval [CI], 0.60 to 0.68) and obesity (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.48 to 
     0.56). These results were consistent across years of assessment, sex, 
     and race/ethnicity. In conclusion, our results highlight the 
     importance of MSA, which is often overlooked in physical activity 
     recommendations in many studies, in combating childhood obesity in 
     the United States.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Jump-landing exercises are often performed 
     during the rehabilitation of Achilles tendon (AT) injuries. However, 
     the factors that affect the AT force (ATF) during landing are 
     unclear. This study aimed to determine the kinematics and ground 
     reaction force (GRF) variables associated with the peak ATF during a 
     drop vertical jump (DVJ). Methods. The landing phase of DVJ was 
     evaluated in 101 healthy participants (46 males, age: 21.2 ± 1.4 
     years old) using a three-dimensional motion analysis system with two 
     force plates. ATF was estimated from the ankle flexion angle and 
     moment. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were 
     performed with the peak ATF as the dependent variable. The vertical 
     GRF (VGRF), center of pressure (COP), forward trunk leaning, 
     hip/knee/ankle joint angles at peak ATF, and sex were used as 
     independent variables. Results. In the univariate regression 
     analysis, larger VGRF (β = 0.813), more anterior COP position (β = 
     0.214), smaller knee flexion (β = −0.251) and adduction (β = 
     −0.252), smaller hip flexion (β = −0.407), smaller forward trunk 
     lean (β = −0.492), and male sex (β = −0.282) were significantly 
     associated with a larger peak ATF. Multivariate analysis revealed 
     that larger VGRF (β = 1.018), more anterior COP position (β = 
     0.320), a larger knee (β = 0.442), and smaller hip flexion (β = 
     −0.205) were associated with the larger peak ATF. Conclusions. The 
     VGRF, COP position, and knee and hip flexion were independently 
     associated with ATF. Modifying these factors may be useful in 
     managing tendon loading during jump-landing exercises.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate 
     the effects of Qigong on the anxiety state, heart rate variability 
     (HRV), and breathing of anxious college students. Methods. A total of 
     37 individuals (18-25 years old) were randomly allocated to the 
     control (n = 19) and intervention (n = 18) groups. Qigong 
     interventions were conducted five times weekly for 12 weeks, with 
     each session lasting 60 min. Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Fatigue Scale 
     14, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 36-item Short Form Survey, 
     HRV, and respiration data were collected before and after the 3-month 
     intervention. Results. Individuals who participated in the 
     three-month Qigong exercise intervention showed a significant 
     reduction in anxiety, particularly mental anxiety (p < 0.05). 
     Subjects in the intervention group presented a decrease in skin 
     temperature (p < 0.05) and an increase in blood volume pulsation (p < 
     0.05). Meanwhile, HRV exhibited a significant increase in the 
     standard deviation of interbeat interval before and after comparisons 
     (p < 0.05) and between the two groups (p = 0.039) and a reduction in 
     the normalized low-frequency power after the intervention. Moreover, 
     the intervention group experienced increased abdominal breathing 
     depth and abdominal breathing per minute (p < 0.05). Conclusion. 
     These findings indicate that Qigong is an effective mind-body 
     exercise strategy for relieving anxiety. HRV and breathing were 
     improved accordingly among college students after the completion of 
     the 3-month Qigong program.]

     AB: Abstract. Investigations of kinetic asymmetries during bilateral 
     squats following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are 
     limited to mainly cross-sectional studies and discrete value data 
     extracted at specific knee angles. We assessed loading asymmetries 
     during squats longitudinally throughout rehabilitation using curve 
     analysis and compared patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) 
     between those with and without asymmetry. Bodyweight squats were 
     performed by 24 individuals (13 females) post-ACLR on three 
     occasions: (1) Early 2.9 (1.1) months; (2) Mid 8.8 (3.1) months; (3) 
     at Return to Sport (RTS) 13.1 (3.6) months; and 29 asymptomatic 
     controls (22 females) once. Time-normalized between-leg asymmetry 
     curves of sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle moments and vertical 
     ground reaction forces were compared using functional data analysis 
     methods. Individual asymmetrical loading for ACLR was classified when 
     exceeding the 95% confidence interval of controls during ≥50% of 
     the squat. At Early, ACLR had greater asymmetry than controls for 
     knee (15%-100% eccentric phase; 0%-100% concentric) and ankle flexion 
     moments (56%-65% concentric). At Mid, ACLR had greater asymmetry for 
     knee (41%-72% eccentric) and ankle flexion moments (56%-69% 
     concentric). No between-group differences were found at RTS. From 
     Early to RTS, ACLR reduced asymmetry for hip (21%-46% eccentric), 
     knee (27%-58% concentric), and ankle flexion moments (21%-57% 
     eccentric). At Early, 11/24 underloaded their ACLR knee and 1 
     overloaded compared with controls. At RTS, 4 underloaded and 6 
     overloaded. No differences in PROMs were found based on loading 
     asymmetry. Beyond the early phase of rehabilitation from ACLR, 
     individual-level analyses are required to reveal differing loading 
     strategies during bilateral squats.]

     AB: Abstract. Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) 
     present muscular weakness and potential changes in the activation of 
     the peroneus longus muscle, which likely explains the high recurrence 
     of ankle sprains in this population. However, there is conflicting 
     evidence regarding the role of the peroneus longus activity in CAI, 
     possibly due to the limited spatial resolution of the surface 
     electromyography (sEMG) methods (i.e. bipolar sEMG). Recent studies 
     employing high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) have shown that the peroneus 
     longus presents differences in regional activation, however, it is 
     unknown whether this regional activation is maintained under 
     pathological conditions such as CAI. This study aimed to compare the 
     myoelectric activity, using HD-sEMG, of each peroneus longus 
     compartment (anterior and posterior) between individuals with and 
     without CAI. Eighteen healthy individuals (No-CAI group) and 18 
     individuals with CAI were recruited. In both groups, the center of 
     mass (COM) and the sEMG amplitude at each compartment were recorded 
     during ankle eversion at different force levels. For the posterior 
     compartment, the sEMG amplitude of CAI group was significantly lower 
     than the No-CAI group (mean difference = 5.6% RMS; 95% CI = 3.4-7.6; 
     p = 0.0001). In addition, it was observed a significant main effect 
     for group (F1,32 = 9.608; p = 0.0040) with an anterior displacement 
     of COM for the CAI group. These findings suggest that CAI alters the 
     regional distribution of muscle activity of the peroneus longus 
     during ankle eversion. In practice, altered regional activation may 
     impact strengthening programs, prevention, and rehabilitation of 
     CAI.]

     a 15-week telerehabilitation program and a detraining period on 
     cardiorespiratory fitness and mechanical efficiency in patients with 
     post-COVID-19 sequelae. Methods. 131 patients with post-COVID-19 
     sequelae were randomly assigned to one of two groups: patients who 
     carried out the supervised telerehabilitation program (TRG, n = 66) 
     and a control group (CG, n = 65). An incremental cardiopulmonary 
     exercise testing (CPET) was performed on cycle ergometer to compare 
     cardioventilatory responses between experimental groups. Results. A 
     significant increase in the CPET duration, peak power output, and 
     mechanical efficiency was observed in TRG compared to CG after the 
     telerehabilitation program (p ≤ 0.001). A significant increase in 
     the CPET duration, peak power output, and mechanical efficiency was 
     verified at 3 months compared to the pretest and after detraining in 
     TRG (p < 0.001). A significant increase in peak oxygen uptake 
     (V̇O2peak) was identified after the intervention and in the 
     detraining period compared to the pretest in both experimental groups 
     (p < 0.001). A higher ventilatory efficiency was observed after the 
     telerehabilitation program (p = 0.021) than in pretest only in TRG. 
     Conclusions. A 15-week supervised home telerehabilitation program 
     improved exercise capacity, power output, and mechanical efficiency 
     in TRG compared to a CG. The telerehabilitation program was not more 
     effective in improving V̇O2peak than the activities of the CG. 
     However, ventilatory efficiency was improved only after the 
     telerehabilitation program. The reported results after the detraining 
     period highlight the need to maintain the rehabilitation program over 
     time.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. The current biomechanical research on the 
     application of Kinesio taping (KT) to patients with chronic ankle 
     instability (CAI) has focused on testing the expected movements. 
     However, unexpected movements are more common in actual sports. 
     Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of KT 
     on the biomechanical characteristics of the knee and ankle joints 
     during unexpected jumping movements. Methods. Twenty-one patients 
     with unilateral CAI were recruited to capture the biomechanical 
     parameters during unexpected jumping movements under different 
     interventions: no taping (NT), placebo taping (PT), and KT. A one-way 
     repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare the 
     differences in knee and ankle biomechanical characteristics among 
     patients with CAI between the three intervention conditions. Results. 
     At initial contact, the KT group demonstrated a significant decrease 
     in ankle plantarflexion and knee flexion angles compared to the NT 
     group (p < 0.05). At the early landing phase, the KT group had a 
     significant increase in peak ankle dorsiflexion angle, peak ankle 
     eversion angle, peak ankle dorsiflexion moment, and peak ankle 
     eversion moment compared to the NT and PT groups (p < 0.05). 
     Furthermore, the KT group had a significantly reduced peak knee 
     flexion angle, peak knee eversion angle, and peak vertical ground 
     reaction force (p < 0.05) compared to the NT and PT groups. 
     Conclusion. KT significantly improves the sprain-prone touchdown 
     posture of patients with CAI. And reducing the risk of ankle sprains 
     during the early landing phase by promoting ankle dorsiflexion and 
     eversion angles and moments.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Among the limited studies on physical 
     exercise interventions in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF), few have 
     specifically addressed the improvement of peripheral muscle strength 
     and body fat-free mass. The aim of this study was to examine the 
     impacts of a remotely supervised, individualized 8-week resistance 
     training program of moderate to high intensity on strength and body 
     composition in these subjects. Methods. This was a randomized 
     controlled trial performed in adults with CF. The exercise group (EX) 
     performed three 1-h resistance training sessions per week over 8 
     weeks. The control group (CON) followed the physical activity 
     recommendations of their physician. The main outcomes were muscle 
     strength and body composition, with secondary measures including 
     pulmonary function and quality of life. Two-way repeated measures 
     analysis was used. Results. In 23 participants (age 32.13 ± 7.72 
     years), the intervention showed a significant beneficial effect on 
     leg press strength, with a large effect size, both in absolute (p = 
     0.011; ηp2 = 0.281) and relative (p = 0.007; ηp2 = 0.310) terms. 
     Large intervention effects were observed on total fat mass (p < 
     0.001; ηp2 = 0.415), body adiposity index (p < 0.001; ηp2 = 
     0.436), and fat mass index (p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.445), all showing 
     reduction in the EX group. In addition, significant large size 
     effects were detected on total fat-free mass (p = 0.046; ηp2 = 
     0.177), trunk fat-free mass (p = 0.039; ηp2 = 0.188), and fat-free 
     mass index (p = 0.048; ηp2 = 0.174), all favoring exercise. No 
     significant effects were observed on pulmonary function and quality 
     of life. Conclusions. An 8-week remotely supervised resistance 
     training program, with moderate to high intensity, effectively 
     improved lower limb muscle strength and body composition.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Overweight and obesity (OWOB) and myopia 
     have become two of the most important issues affecting the health of 
     children and adolescents worldwide. Despite the recognition that the 
     school physical activity (PA) environment is a critical factor for 
     preventing and controlling overweight, obesity (OWOB), and myopia in 
     children and adolescents, research on OWOB and myopia as a 
     comorbidity remains unexplored, with evidence for effective 
     strategies still being inconclusive. Hence, this study aimed to 
     assess the prevalence and progression of comorbid OWOB/myopia and 
     each condition alone, and to explore the association with school PA 
     environment. Methods. A total of 9814 children and adolescents aged 
     6-18 years were included from the Chinese National Survey on 
     Students' Constitution and Health follow-up survey conducted from 
     November 2019 to November 2020 in China. Anthropometric measurements, 
     unaided distance vision acuity and non-cycloplegic refraction data 
     were collected to assess OWOB and myopia, while eight indicators from 
     questionnaires for children and adolescents aged 9-18 years were 
     investigated to assess school PA environment. We calculated the 
     one-year incidence and progression rates of comorbid OWOB/myopia, 
     OWOB alone, and myopia alone. Mixed effect logistic regression was 
     evaluated the association between school PA environment and incidence 
     and progression of comorbid OWOB/myopia, OWOB, and myopia. Results. 
     The prevalence of comorbid OWOB/myopia increased from 11.1% in 2019 
     to 17.9% in 2020, and the incidence of comorbid OWOB/myopia was 
     10.9%. Children and adolescents experiencing an unfavorable school PA 
     environment had a higher risk of the incidence of comorbid 
     OWOB/myopia compared to a favorable school environment (OR = 1.85, 
     95% CI: 1.42-2.42). Similar findings were seen in the incidence of 
     obesity (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.26-2.75). Children and adolescents in 
     an unfavorable school PA environment had a higher risk of myopia 
     progression (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.65). Conclusions. Obesity and 
     myopia and their comorbidity have been serious among children and 
     adolescents in China. A favorable school PA environment might 
     mitigate the risk of comorbid OWOB/myopia, OWOB, and myopia 
     progression.]

     greater lateral trunk bending angles, knee flexion angles at initial 
     contact, peak knee abduction angles, and peak knee adduction moments 
     compared to no perturbation. The falling condition significantly 
     demonstrated the greatest lateral trunk bending angles, knee flexion 
     angles, and peak knee external rotation moments and the smallest peak 
     knee abduction angles, peak VGRF, and peak knee extension moments 
     compared to natural/soft landings regardless of perturbation 
     conditions. Mid-flight external perturbation resulted in variables 
     associated with greater ACL loading during single-leg landings. 
     Falling demonstrated variables associated with smaller ACL loading, 
     particularly for perturbation conditions. Incorporating falling 
     techniques into jump-landing training programs may guide players to 
     safely fall on the ground when perturbation occurs. Falling provides 
     an alternative strategy to potentially decrease indirect contact ACL 
     injury risk when the sports environment allows.]

     AB: Abstract. The Biering-Sørensen test is commonly used to assess 
     paraspinal muscle endurance. Research using a single repetition of 
     the test has provided conflicting evidence for the contribution of 
     impaired paraspinal muscle endurance to low back pain (LBP). This 
     study investigated how Sørensen test duration, muscle activation, 
     and muscle fatigability are affected by multiple repetitions of the 
     test and determined predictors of Sørensen test duration in young 
     adults with and without a history of LBP. Sixty-four young 
     individuals performed three repetitions of the Sørensen test. 
     Amplitude of activation and median frequency slope (fatigability) 
     were calculated for the lumbar and thoracic paraspinals and 
     hamstrings. Duration of the test was significantly less for the 3rd 
     repetition in individuals with LBP. In individuals without LBP, test 
     duration was predicted by fatigability of the lumbar paraspinals. In 
     individuals with LBP, Sørensen test duration was predicted by 
     fatigability of the hamstrings and amplitude of activation of the 
     thoracic and lumbar paraspinals. Our findings demonstrate that it is 
     necessary to amplify the difficulty of the Sørensen test to reveal 
     impairments in young, active adults with LBP. Training programs 
     aiming to improve lumbar paraspinal performance should monitor 
     performance of other synergist muscles during endurance exercise.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. To compare the short, medium, and long-term 
     effects of balance exercises combined with either peroneal 
     neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) or peroneal 
     transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on dynamic 
     postural control and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) in 
     patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Methods. Thirty-four 
     participants with CAI were randomly assigned to a 12-session home 
     based exercise program combined with NMES (Ex-NMES) or TENS (Ex- 
     TENS). Baseline postural control was tested with the modified Star 
     Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT) and time to stabilization (TTS) after 
     a single-leg drop-jump. The self-reported function was measured using 
     the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT), the Identification of 
     Functional Ankle Instability (IdFAI), and the Sports subscale of the 
     Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAMSport). Results. Both groups 
     showed significant improvements in all self-reported outcome measures 
     at the 12-month follow-up. Subjects in the Ex-NMES group had 
     significantly better IdFAI (-4.2 [95% CI −8.1, −0.2]) and 
     FAAMSport (13.7 [95% CI 2.2, 25.2]) scores at 6- and 12-month 
     follow-up, respectively, compared to the Ex-TENS group. Medium to 
     large between-group effect sizes were observed in self-reported 
     functional outcomes and the mSEBT. Conclusion. The consistent trend 
     of improvement in self-reported functional outcomes when training is 
     combined with NMES compared with training with TENS may indicate a 
     potential benefit that should be further investigated as a treatment 
     for patients with CAI.]

     AB: Abstract. Rehabilitation is a major requirement to improve the 
     quality of life and mobility of patients with disabilities. The use 
     of rehabilitative devices without continuous supervision of medical 
     experts is increasing manifold, mainly due to prolonged therapy costs 
     and advancements in robotics. Due to ExoMechHand's inexpensive cost, 
     high robustness, and efficacy for participants with median and ulnar 
     neuropathies, we have recommended it as a rehabilitation tool in this 
     study. ExoMechHand is coupled with three different resistive plates 
     for hand impairment. For efficacy, ten unhealthy subjects with median 
     or ulnar nerve neuropathies are considered. After twenty days of 
     continuous exercise, three subjects showed improvement in their hand 
     grip, range of motion of the wrist, or range of motion of 
     metacarpophalangeal joints. The condition of the hand is assessed by 
     features of surface-electromyography signals. A Machine-learning 
     model based on these features of fifteen subjects is used for staging 
     the condition of the hand. Machine-learning algorithms are trained to 
     indicate the type of resistive plate to be used by the subject 
     without the need for examination by the therapist. The extra-trees 
     classifier came out to be the most effective algorithm with 98% 
     accuracy on test data for indicating the type of resistive plate, 
     followed by random-forest and gradient-boosting with accuracies of 
     95% and 93%, respectively. Results showed that the staging of hand 
     condition could be analyzed by sEMG signal obtained from the 
     flexor-carpi-ulnaris and flexor-carpi-radialis muscles in subjects 
     with median and ulnar neuropathies.]

     AB: Abstract. A well-fitting socket and a fine-tuned foot alignment 
     are crucial elements in a running-specific prosthesis to allow 
     Paralympic athletes with below-knee amputation to express their full 
     competitive potential. For this reason, once a satisfactory 
     socket-foot configuration is established after dynamic alignment, it 
     is fundamental to reproduce the same conditions when constructing the 
     definitive carbon fiber socket, and when renewing or constructing a 
     back-up prosthesis, without dismantling the original. In addition, to 
     cope with emerging needs of the athlete, it would be beneficial to 
     implement fine-tuning adjustments of the alignment in a very 
     controlled manner. At present, this requires elaborate bench 
     procedures, which tend to be expensive, time consuming, prone to 
     manual errors, cumbersome in use and most often require damaging or 
     disposing of the current socket. In this study, we propose an 
     original CAD/CAM workflow that allows replicating the desired 
     socket-foot configuration for below-knee sprinting prostheses, as 
     well as performing socket adaptations and introducing fine-tuning 
     adjustments to the alignments. The workflow is exemplified with 
     reference to two case studies involving elite Paralympic runners with 
     transtibial and partial foot amputations, respectively.]

     loading doses of nusinersen on motor function and quality of life 
     (QoL) in adult patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). 
     Twenty-one adult patients with genetically confirmed SMA who were 
     treated with 4 loading doses of nusinersen were included in this 
     study. All patients were evaluated with the Medical Research Council 
     (MRC) scale, the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), 
     and the Short Form Survey-36 (SF-36) at baseline (V1) and before the 
     first nusinersen maintenance treatment, which was at the 15th month 
     of treatment (V2). The SF-36 score was compared between the patients 
     and 35 age-matched healthy controls. Of the twenty-one patients with 
     a median age of 36 years, 10 were nonambulatory, and 11 were 
     ambulatory. The physical component score and the mental component 
     score of the SF-36 were significantly lower in the SMA patient group 
     at baseline than in the healthy group. The median HFMSE scores 
     significantly improved at V2 in both ambulatory and nonambulatory SMA 
     patients (p < 0.05). The median MRC score significantly increased at 
     V2 in the ambulatory SMA patient group (p = 0.04) but not in the 
     nonambulatory SMA patient group (p = 0.19). There was a significant 
     improvement in physical QoL in all the SMA patients at V2 (p = 0.02), 
     but there was no significant improvement in mental QoL (p = 0.15). 
     The loading nusinersen treatment significantly improved motor 
     function scores, muscle strength, and physical QoL.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. We aimed to examine self-reported physical 
     activity (PA) and sitting time (ST) in older patients with type 1 
     diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in daily clinical practice, 
     and their associations with metabolic health, namely body mass index 
     (BMI) and glycemic control (HbA1c). Methods. This cross-sectional 
     cohort non-exposure study included 117 patients (n = 29 T1D and n = 
     88 T2D), aged 71.6 ± 1.1 years, on insulin regimens. Statistical 
     analyses were conducted on data gathered with the validated 
     International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results. T1D patients 
     reported a longer duration of weekly physical activity and shorter 
     duration of sitting time compared to T2D patients (active 162 ± 32 
     vs 72 ± 12 minutes weekly; sedentary 4.4 ± 0.7 vs 6.7 ± 0.9 hours 
     daily, respectively) (P < 0.01 for both). PA was negatively 
     associated with BMI in T1D (r = -0.5; P < 0.01). ST was positively 
     associated with BMI in T2D (r = 0.2; P < 0.05). Only the (T2D + T1D) 
     patients who achieved > 1500 metabolic equivalent-minutes weekly had 
     significantly lower HbA1c (7.9 ± 1.6% vs.7.3 ± 1.2% (P < 0.05). 
     Conclusions. Physical inactivity was associated with a higher BMI in 
     a real-world cohort of older patients with diabetes, on insulin 
     treatment. Beneficial effects of PA on glycemic control were observed 
     only in the highly active subgroup. Assessing and addressing 
     health-enhancing physical activity should be integrated into everyday 
     clinical practice, since encouraging different modes of physical 
     activity and interrupting sitting behavior has potential health 
     implications.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Like children with typical language 
     development, their peers with developmental language disorder (DLD) 
     are expected to learn English as a foreign language (EFL). For pupils 
     without DLD, it is well-established that amount of informal exposure 
     to English outside of the classroom, starting age of EFL instruction 
     and motivation are strong positive predictors of EFL learning rate 
     and/or achievement, whereas anxiety is negatively related to 
     performance. This paper is the first attempt to investigate how these 
     predictors of EFL performance operate in learners with DLD. Methods. 
     Participants were nineteen Dutch-speaking 7th graders with DLD 
     learning English as a school subject at a specialist education 
     facility in the Netherlands. English receptive grammar and receptive 
     vocabulary were measured twice, with a four-month interval. Foreign 
     language learning motivation, anxiety and (length and amount of) 
     informal exposure to and instruction in English were measured via 
     questionnaires. Results. The participants did not show any progress 
     on English vocabulary and grammar. At Time 1, vocabulary and grammar 
     scores were positively related to starting age of EFL instruction and 
     negatively related to anxiety. For vocabulary, achievement was also 
     positively predicted by attitudes towards English lessons. Only the 
     relationship between starting age of instruction and vocabulary 
     outcomes was visible at Time 2. Amount and length of informal 
     exposure to English did not predict performance, which is in stark 
     contrast to the patterns observed in EFL learners with typical 
     language development. Conclusions. We conclude that children with DLD 
     benefit from a later onset of foreign language lessons, whereas 
     length and amount of out-of-school exposure to English are less 
     important in the context of DLD, possibly due to difficulty with 
     implicit learning.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. One's ability to repair communication 
     breakdown is an important pragmatic language skill. The present study 
     examined children's communication repair strategies between online 
     and face-to-face interactions using a reading comprehension task 
     designed to probe for persistent clarification requests. Methods: 
     4-6-year-old typically developing children (Age: M = 5.5years) 
     completed a communication repair task. Online group (n = 17) 
     completed the task online, face-to-face group(n = 22) met researchers 
     in person. Children's responses were then categorized into verbal 
     strategies, supplementary strategies, and nonresponses. Results. Our 
     results showed that children can effectively employ repair strategies 
     when a communication breakdown occurs, regardless of the 
     communication setting in response to a series of clarification 
     requests. However, types and patterns of communication repair 
     strategies varied between online and face-to-face interactions. 
     Children in online interaction showed higher use of repetition and 
     suprasegmental strategies than did their face-to-face peers. In 
     contrast, children in face-to-face interaction demonstrated more 
     frequent use of revision and addition. Also, we examined the 
     relationship between repair strategy and children's language skills. 
     The results showed that children with better language skills used 
     more addition, which is a more complex strategy than suprasegmental 
     and nonresponse, and tried to use repair strategies effectively in an 
     attempt to repair their statements as clarification requests 
     proceeded. Conclusion. It is important to understand different trends 
     of pragmatic skills of children across online and face-to-face 
     interaction. Guidance on the effective strategy to repair 
     communication breakdowns depending on the different contexts needs to 
     be considered for the successful use of online learning and 
     telepractice.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Heightened rates of social anxiety have been 
     reported in adults who stutter (AWS), but it is unclear whether 
     anxiety is heightened also in children who stutter (CWS). Objective 
     neurophysiological responses such as the error-related negativity 
     (ERN) have been associated with anxiety, and ERN was reported to be 
     increased in AWS. In this study, we examined whether ERN and error 
     positivity (Pe) are increased in CWS. We further characterized ERN 
     associations with age and anxiety in CWS relative to children who do 
     not stutter (CWNS). Methods. EEG data were recorded from twenty-four 
     CWS and twenty-four matched CWNS aged 3-9 years as they performed a 
     Go/No-Go task. Parent-reported anxiety, and child-reported 
     speech-associated attitude measures were collected. Linear regression 
     models tested the effects of age, group, and their interaction, and 
     the effects of anxiety, group, and their interaction on ERN and Pe. 
     Results. Contrary to expectations, no ERN or Pe difference were 
     observed between CWS and CWNS. However, larger ERN amplitudes were 
     associated with older age in CWS but not CWNS, suggesting altered 
     development of the error monitoring system in CWS. Association of Pe 
     with anxiety also differed between groups: smaller Pe amplitudes were 
     associated with higher level of parent-reported child anxiety in CWNS 
     but not in CWS. Neither anxiety nor self-reported communication 
     attitude differed between groups. Conclusions. Brain responses to 
     errors were overall comparable between CWS and CWNS. However, CWS 
     differed in how error monitoring responses varied with age and with 
     anxiety levels. More research is warranted to examine how these 
     factors contribute to persistent stuttering.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Previous studies have shown increased 
     prevalence of sleep problems among people who stutter. However, there 
     is a lack of knowledge about what these sleep problems may 
     specifically be. Method. Fifty children who stutter (CWS) from 6;0 to 
     12;9 years of age and 50 age- and gender-matched controls 
     participated in this study. Parents did not report coexisting 
     conditions, excepting stuttering and/or sleep problems. Sleep 
     problems were investigated using a standardized questionnaire 
     answered by parents. The questionnaire shows cut-off scores to 
     identify the risk of sleep problems as a whole and on each one of the 
     six subscales (i.e. disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep; 
     sleep breathing disorders; disorders of arousal; sleep-wake 
     transition disorders; disorders of excessive somnolence; and sleep 
     hyperhidrosis). Scores above the cut-off are suggestive of sleep 
     problems. Results. Twenty-one CWS scored higher than the cut-off on 
     the sleep questionnaire compared to only two controls (p < 0.00001). 
     Specifically, CWS scored higher than controls in disorders of 
     initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep-wake transition disorders 
     (especially jerking, sleep talking, and bruxism), and disorders of 
     excessive somnolence (p < 0.0083, corrected for multiple 
     comparisons). Discussion. Compared to controls, CWS are at greater 
     risk for sleep problems, which are not consequences of coexisting 
     disorders. Present findings confirm and expand current knowledge 
     about sleep problems in CWS. Directionality possibilities and 
     clinical implications are discussed.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Neurophysiological studies report that people 
     who stutter (PWS) exhibit enhanced motor preparation before they 
     stutter. This motor preparation pattern raises the possibility of 
     detecting upcoming stutter moments before they actually occur. This 
     study examined whether these motor preparation differences are 
     detectable by listeners in the corresponding acoustic signal, thereby 
     allowing them to predict upcoming stuttering moments. If so, features 
     in these acoustic patterns could potentially be employed by 
     computational procedures to automate detection of upcoming stutters 
     and to target auditory feedback alterations specifically on these 
     locations. Methods. Forty healthy normal-hearing participants (aged 
     18-30) listened to seemingly fluent speech extracts each of which was 
     either followed by a fluent (control condition) or stuttered 
     (experimental condition) moment after the fluent extract. 
     Participants listened to each extract and rated the likelihood of the 
     speaker stuttering on the next word on a scale of 1 (very unlikely) 
     to 7 (very likely) as to whether they thought there was a subsequent 
     stutter. Several measures were made on the speech extracts which were 
     examined either as control requirements to ensure no differences 
     between experimental and control material or as covariates to assess 
     any effects they had on judgments between the two conditions. 
     Results. Listeners gave significantly higher stutter-likelihood 
     ratings for speech originally followed by a stuttered moment although 
     effects were small. Conclusions. Naive listeners rated speech 
     extracts that were subsequently followed by stuttered moments as more 
     likely to be followed by a stutter than those that were followed by 
     fluent words after the effects of significant covariates were 
     excluded.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. This study compared the attitudes toward 
     stuttering among college students in China and the USA using the 
     POSHA-S survey, which assesses knowledge about stuttering and 
     attitudes toward it. We investigated how cultural and social 
     differences between the two groups influenced these attitudes. 
     Methods. We collected 199 responses to the POSHA-S survey from 
     various universities in China and the USA. We conducted a statistical 
     analysis of 15 summary scores generated from the POSHA-S to determine 
     if there were significant differences in attitudes toward stuttering 
     between the two groups. Additionally, we retrieved percentile ranks 
     relative to the global POSHA-S database to compare attitudes in both 
     groups with global median scores. Results. The study revealed that 
     Chinese college students hold more negative attitudes toward 
     stuttering compared to their American counterparts and the global 
     median scores. We discussed the social and cultural factors that may 
     contribute to these attitudes. Furthermore, our findings emphasized 
     the importance of addressing the lack of accurate information about 
     stuttering in China, which could be a key factor driving these 
     negative attitudes. Conclusion. These results underscore the urgent 
     need to raise awareness about stuttering and promote a shift in 
     public attitudes, especially among college students in China, who 
     play influential roles in society's future.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Lifestyle modification interventions for 
     adults with intellectual disabilities have had, to date, mixed 
     effectiveness. This study aimed to understand how lifestyle 
     modification interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities 
     work, for whom they work and in what circumstances. Methods. A 
     realist evidence synthesis was conducted that incorporated input from 
     adults with intellectual disabilities and expert researchers. 
     Following the development of an initial programme theory based on key 
     literature and input from people with lived experience and academics 
     working in this field, five major databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, 
     PsycINFO and ASSIA) and clinical trial repositories were 
     systematically searched. Data from 79 studies were synthesised to 
     develop context, mechanism and outcome configurations (CMOCs). 
     Results. The contexts and mechanisms identified related to the 
     ability of adults with intellectual disabilities to actively take 
     part in the intervention, which in turn contributes to what works, 
     for whom and in what circumstances. The included CMOCs related to 
     support involvement, negotiating the balance between autonomy and 
     behaviour change, fostering social connectedness and fun, 
     accessibility and suitability of intervention strategies and delivery 
     and broader behavioural pathways to lifestyle change. It is also 
     essential to work with people with lived experiences when developing 
     and evaluating interventions. Conclusions. Future lifestyle 
     interventions research should be participatory in nature, and 
     accessible data collection methods should also be explored as a way 
     of including people with severe and profound intellectual 
     disabilities in research. More emphasis should be given to the 
     broader benefits of lifestyle change, such as opportunities for 
     social interaction and connectedness.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. The incidence of patients with fractures 
     is increasing and so is the impact on health care systems and 
     society. To improve patient care, measurement of disabilities and 
     impaired health experiences after traumatic musculoskeletal injuries 
     are important. Next to objective clinical parameters, PROM(I)S can be 
     used to map health domains important to patients. We aimed to 
     objectify different aspects of (health-related) quality of life in 
     fracture patients, including the ability to participate in social 
     roles and activities using PROMIS among other PROMs. Methods. An 
     observational cohort study was performed in which health-related 
     quality of life in fracture patients was measured. Patients aged 18 
     year and older either treated conservatively or surgically between 
     November 2020 and June 2022 were included. Participants were followed 
     for a maximum of one year and completed the following PROMs: 
     PROMIS-CAT physical function, PROMIS-CAT pain interference, 
     PROMIS-CAT ability to participate in social roles and activities and 
     LEFS or QDASH. We applied a univariate linear mixed model to evaluate 
     significance of improvement. Results. Seven hundred-forty six 
     patients with a mean age of 54.4 years were included. Mean PROMIS 
     scores were structurally inferior in the lower extremity (LE) 
     fracture group in comparison with the upper extremity (UE) fracture 
     group. For "PROMIS physical function", UE fracture patients performed 
     better and showed physical progression earlier. For "PROMIS pain 
     interference", UE fracture patients experienced fewer limitations, 
     but it took longer to experience improvement in this group. For 
     "PROMIS ability to participate in social roles", significant 
     improvement was only seen in the UE fracture group at one year follow 
     up. Conclusion. Upper -and lower extremity fractures can have a 
     significant impact on physical function and social health. Patients 
     with UE fractures tend to have fewer limitations compared to LE 
     fracture patients. Physical function and pain interference is most 
     impaired shortly after the injury in all fracture patients and show 
     significant changes over time, social health improves less over time. 
     Moment of measurement should be based on type of fracture and can 
     differ between individual patients, but when generic measures and 
     outcomes are desirable, PROMIS questionnaires can potentially be used 
     measurement.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. The aim of this systematic review and 
     meta-analysis is to describe the effect of digitally delivered 
     exercise on pain, physical function and quality of life (QoL) for 
     people with knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. Articles were 
     eligible for inclusion if they were of a randomized control trial 
     that evaluated the prescription of digitally delivered exercise 
     (requiring the internet) in people with symptomatic primary hip 
     and/or knee OA. Risk of bias was assessed using the Physiotherapy 
     Evidence Database scale, and levels of evidence were assessed 
     according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and 
     Evaluation. Results. Digitally delivered exercise was delivered via 
     synchronous and asynchronous methods (or a combination of both). 
     Digitally delivered exercise was superior to education only for pain 
     and physical function, with high-quality evidence for quality-of-life 
     outcomes in the long-term (standardized mean difference −0.35, 95% 
     confidence interval −0.59 to −0.12, P = 0.003) in people with 
     knee OA. Furthermore, there was very low to low-quality evidence that 
     digitally delivered exercise was comparable to face-to-face delivery 
     in the short and long-term for people with hip or knee OA and 
     comparable in the medium-term for people with knee OA only. 
     Discussion. The review demonstrated very low to low-quality evidence 
     that digitally delivered exercise was comparable to face-to-face 
     delivery for pain, function and QoL. In the absence of higher-level 
     evidence, we would provisionally recommend that healthcare providers 
     offer the choice of face-to-face or digitally delivered exercise 
     intervention for people with hip or knee OA. Further work is required 
     to understand these programs' reach, access, uptake and 
     implementation across diverse population groups.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Staff in long-term care (LTC) homes have 
     long-standing stressors, such as short staffing and high workloads. 
     These stressors increased during the COVID-19 pandemic; better 
     resources are needed to help staff manage stress and well-being. The 
     purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a simple stress 
     management strategy (coherent breathing). Methods. We conducted a 
     pre-post intervention study to evaluate a self-managed coherent 
     breathing intervention from February to September 2022. The 
     intervention included basic (breathing only) and comprehensive 
     (breathing plus a biofeedback device) groups. Six hundred eighty-six 
     participants were initially recruited (359 and 327 in the 
     comprehensive and basic groups respectively) from 31 LTC homes in 
     Alberta, Canada. Two hundred fifty-four participants completed 
     pre-and post-intervention questionnaires (142 [55.9%] in 
     comprehensive and 112 [44.1%] in basic). Participants were asked to 
     use coherent breathing based on a schedule increasing from 2 to 10 
     min daily, 5-7 times a week over 8 weeks. Participants completed 
     self-administered online questionnaires pre- and post-intervention to 
     assess outcomes-stress, psychological distress, anxiety, depression, 
     resilience, insomnia, compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue, 
     and burnout. We used a mixed-effects regression model to test the 
     main effect of time (pre- and post-intervention) and group while 
     testing the interaction between time and group and controlling for 
     covariates. Results. We found statistically significant changes from 
     pre- to post-intervention in stress (b = −2.5, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 
     −3.1, −1.9), anxiety (b = −0.5, p < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.7, 
     −0.3), depression (b = −0.4, p < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.6, −0.2), 
     insomnia (b = −1.5, p < 0.001, 95% CI = −2.1, −0.9), and 
     resilience (b = 0.2, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.1, 0.2). We observed no 
     statistically significant differences between the two intervention 
     groups on any outcome. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that 
     coherent breathing is a promising strategy for improving 
     stress-related outcomes and resilience. This intervention warrants 
     further, more rigorous testing.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The prevalence of cognitive impairment in 
     home health physical therapy (HHPT) is unknown. We sought to identify 
     the prevalence of cognitive impairment, including cognitive 
     impairment no dementia (CIND) and dementia, among older adults who 
     used HHPT, and if cognitive impairment prevalence was higher among 
     those with HHPT-relevant characteristics. Methods. For our 
     cross-sectional analysis, we identified 963 fee-for-service Medicare 
     beneficiaries with HHPT claims (>85 years old: 28.8%, women: 63.7%, 
     non-Hispanic White: 82.1%) in the 2014 and 2016 waves of the Health 
     and Retirement Study (HRS) and used a validated algorithm to 
     categorize cognitive status as normal, CIND, or dementia. We 
     estimated the population prevalence and calculated age, gender, 
     race/ethnicity adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of CIND and dementia for 
     characteristics relevant to HHPT service delivery including 
     depression, walking difficulty, fall history, incontinence, 
     moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) ≤1x/week, and 
     community-initiated HHPT using multinomial logistic regression. 
     Results. The population prevalence of cognitive impairment was 46.4% 
     (CIND: 27.3%, dementia: 19.1%). The prevalence of cognitive 
     impairment was greater among those with depression (46.7% vs. 39.5%), 
     difficulty walking across the room (58.9% vs. 41.8%), fall history 
     (49.1% vs. 42.9%), MVPA ≤1x/week (50.0% vs. 38.0%), and 
     community-initiated HHPT (55.2% vs. 40.2%). Compared to normal 
     cognitive status, the odds of cognitive impairment were greater for 
     those with MVPA≤1x/week (CIND: aOR = 1.57 [95% CI: 1.05-2.33], 
     dementia: aOR = 2.55 [95% CI: 1.54-4.22]), depression (dementia: aOR 
     = 1.99 [95% CI: 1.19-3.30]), difficulty walking across the room 
     (dementia: aOR = 2.54 [95% CI: 1.40-4.60]), fall history (dementia: 
     aOR = 1.85 [95% CI: 1.20-2.83]), and community-initiated HHPT 
     (dementia: aOR = 1.72 (95% CI: 1.13-2.61]). Conclusion. There is a 
     high prevalence of CIND and dementia in HHPT, and no characteristics 
     had a low prevalence of cognitive impairment. Physical therapists 
     should be ready to identify cognitive impairment and adapt home 
     health service delivery for this vulnerable population of older 
     adults.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Loneliness is a significant public health 
     challenge in the United States, especially among older adults. The 
     epidemiology of loneliness among older adults in primary care is 
     lacking, and specific research is needed on how loneliness impacts 
     older primary patients' physical, mental, and cognitive health. A 
     large sample of older primary care patients were recruited for a 
     trial during the COVID-19 pandemic to measure the relationship 
     between loneliness and physical and mental quality of life (QOL). 
     Methods. Baseline data come from the Caregiver Outcomes of 
     Alzheimer's Disease Screening (COADS) study, an ongoing randomized 
     controlled trial evaluating benefits and risks of Alzheimer's disease 
     and related dementias screening among primary care patients ages 65 
     and older, collected April 2020 to September 2021. Loneliness was 
     measured with the 5-item, Loneliness Fixed Form Ages 18+ from The NIH 
     Toolbox Emotion Battery, physical and mental health-related QOL was 
     measured with the SF-36v2, and depression and anxiety severity were 
     measured with the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively. Results. Spearman 
     correlation analyses revealed that loneliness was moderately 
     correlated with mental health QOL (r[601] = −0.43, p < 0.001), 
     anxiety severity (r[601] = 0.44, p < 0.001), and depression severity 
     (r[601] = 0.42, p < 0.001), while weakly correlated with physical 
     health QOL (r[601] = −0.15, p < 0.001). After conducting unadjusted 
     and adjusted linear regression models, we found that loneliness was 
     significantly associated with both lower mental (p < 0.001) and 
     physical (p < 0.001) QOL. Furthermore, loneliness remained 
     significantly associated with worse mental QOL after adjusting for 
     age, gender, race, ethnicity, educational level, perceived income 
     status, neighborhood disadvantage, severity of comorbidities, and 
     comorbid depression and anxiety. Conclusion. Primary care providers 
     should discuss loneliness with their older adult patients and provide 
     resources to help patients develop and maintain meaningful social 
     relationships.]

     Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may experience a lower quality of life 
     (QoL) than parents of offspring with typical development. However, 
     factors associated with parental QoL are not yet fully understood. 
     Aims. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between 
     parental QoL, child adjustment and adult attachment among parents of 
     children and adolescents with ASD. Methods and procedures. One 
     hundred and eighty-eight parents of children and adolescents 
     diagnosed with ASD completed a group of self-report questionnaires on 
     sociodemographic variables, QoL (i.e. overall QoL and ASD 
     symptoms-related parental QoL), child adjustment (i.e. offspring's 
     total problems and prosocial behaviors) and adult attachment. 
     Outcomes and results. Structural equation modeling revealed that the 
     overall parental QoL was negatively related to children's total 
     problems and positively associated with prosocial behaviors, as well 
     as with higher levels of secure attachment and lower levels of 
     fearful attachment styles. Additionally, ASD symptoms-related 
     parental QoL was negatively associated with the offspring's total 
     problems. Conclusions and implications. This suggests that child 
     characteristics may interact with parental characteristics to either 
     enhance or compromise the QoL of parents of children and adolescents 
     with ASD. Implications of these findings for promoting parental QoL 
     are discussed]

     In adults with an exacerbation of COPD, exercise training prescribed 
     within 48 h of hospitalisation was safe and improved exercise 
     capacity and physical function.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Mobile phone applications (apps) show 
     promise for enhancing asthma self-management, but their effectiveness 
     varies. This study examined the effect of a smartphone asthma app on 
     asthma control and quality of life. Methods. Using block 
     randomization, 60 patients with asthma were allocated to an 
     intervention group (n = 30) or control group (n = 30) for this 
     single-blind randomized controlled trial. At baseline, both groups 
     completed the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Asthma Quality of Life 
     Questionnaire-Marks (AQLQ-M). The intervention group used a 
     smartphone-based asthma self-management app plus their regular 
     treatment, while the control group received only usual care. 
     Follow-up ACT and AQLQ-M assessments occurred at 3 and 6 months. SPSS 
     version 26 was used for analysis, including descriptive statistics, 
     non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U), and analysis of 
     variance with repeated measurements. Results. Both groups showed 
     improved asthma control and quality of life at 3 and 6 months 
     compared to baseline. However, after 6 months the intervention group 
     had significantly greater improvement than controls (p < 0.05). 
     Repeated measures ANOVA revealed divergent changes in ACT and AQLQ-M 
     scores over time, with the intervention group demonstrating greater 
     enhancement of asthma control and quality of life (p < 0.001). 
     Conclusion. This study demonstrated that use of a smartphone-based 
     asthma self-management app improved asthma control and quality of 
     life after 6 months compared to usual care alone. These findings 
     indicate that guideline-based asthma apps can positively impact 
     outcomes.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. About 50% of patients who sustain an 
     anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury are treated without ACL 
     reconstruction (ACL-R). A significant proportion of these patients 
     opt for late ACL-R. Patients' experience of changing treatment has 
     not yet been investigated and presented in the scientific literature. 
     Aim. To explore patients' experiences before and after changing 
     treatment from ACL rehabilitation alone to ACL-R. Method. Fifteen 
     patients were interviewed in semi-structured interviews, which were 
     recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with qualitative content 
     analysis, based on the method described by Graneheim and Lundman. 
     Patients were between 26 and 58 years old, and had tried 
     rehabilitation for a minimum of 9 months prior to ACL-R. Results. Two 
     themes, "Expecting what could not be achieved: the struggle to 
     recover and not becoming stable", and "Internal completeness: 
     expectations can be achieved", emerged from the analysis. Each theme 
     was supported by three main categories and 5-6 subcategories. The 
     first theme represents the journey before ACL-R, where patients 
     experienced getting stronger, but perceived the knee as unstable. The 
     second theme represents the journey after ACL-R, where patients 
     expressed that they felt whole after their ACL-R, and where able to 
     achieve their expections. Patients experienced a greater support from 
     the healthcare system, and ultimately expressed a feeling of having 
     achieved the unachievable after ACL-R. Summary. Patients who cross 
     over from ACL rehabilitation to ACL-R experienced rehabilitation 
     alone as insufficient to achieve the desired outcomes, which resulted 
     in a need to opt for delayed ACL-R. Healthcare providers need to 
     support patients, who primarily choose to undergo rehabilitation 
     alone and later opt for ACL-R, throughout the whole rehabilitation 
     process.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Lower capacity to generate knee extension 
     maximal voluntary force (MVF) has been observed in individuals 
     affected with patellar tendinopathy (PT) compared to asymptomatic 
     controls. This MVF deficit is hypothesized to emanate from 
     alterations in corticospinal excitability (CSE). The modulation of 
     CSE is intricately linked to the excitability levels at multiple 
     sites, encompassing neurones within the corticospinal tract (CST), 
     intracortical neurones within the primary motor cortex (M1), and the 
     alpha motoneurone. The aim of this investigation was to examine the 
     excitability of intracortical neurones, CST neurones, and the alpha 
     motoneurone, and compare these between volleyball and basketball 
     athletes with PT and matched asymptomatic controls. Method. Nineteen 
     athletes with PT and 18 asymptomatic controls participated in this 
     cross-sectional study. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was utilized 
     to assess CST excitability, corticospinal inhibition (silent period, 
     and short-interval cortical inhibition). Peripheral nerve stimulation 
     was used to evaluate lumbar spine and alpha motoneurone excitability, 
     including the evocation of lumbar-evoked potentials and maximal 
     compound muscle action potential (MMAX), and CSE with central 
     activation ratio (CAR). Knee extension MVF was also assessed. 
     Results. Athletes with PT exhibited longer silent period duration and 
     greater electrical stimulator output for MMAX, as well as lower MVF, 
     compared to asymptomatic controls (p < 0.05). Conclusion. These 
     findings indicate volleyball and basketball athletes with PT exhibit 
     reduced excitability of the alpha motoneurone or the neuromuscular 
     junction, which may be linked to lower MVF. Subtle alterations at 
     specific sites may represent compensatory changes to excitability 
     aiming to maintain efferent drive to the knee extensors.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. The number of randomized controlled 
     trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of exercise among cancer 
     survivors has increased in recent years; however, participants 
     dropping out of the trials are rarely described. The objective of the 
     present study was to assess which combinations of participant and 
     exercise program characteristics were associated with dropout from 
     the exercise arms of RCTs among cancer survivors. Methods. This study 
     used data collected in the Predicting OptimaL cAncer RehabIlitation 
     and Supportive care (POLARIS) study, an international database of 
     RCTs investigating the effects of exercise among cancer survivors. 
     Thirty-four exercise trials, with a total of 2467 patients without 
     metastatic disease randomized to an exercise arm were included. 
     Harmonized studies included a pre and a posttest, and participants 
     were classified as dropouts when missing all assessments at the 
     post-intervention test. Subgroups were identified with a conditional 
     inference tree. Results. Overall, 9.6% of the participants dropped 
     out. Five subgroups were identified in the conditional inference tree 
     based on four significant associations with dropout. Most dropout was 
     observed for participants with BMI >28.4 kg/m2, performing supervised 
     resistance or unsupervised mixed exercise (19.8% dropout) or had 
     low-medium education and performed aerobic or supervised mixed 
     exercise (13.5%). The lowest dropout was found for participants with 
     BMI >28.4 kg/m2 and high education performing aerobic or supervised 
     mixed exercise (5.1%), and participants with BMI ≤28.4 kg/m2 
     exercising during (5.2%) or post (9.5%) treatment. Conclusions. There 
     are several systematic differences between cancer survivors 
     completing and dropping out from exercise trials, possibly affecting 
     the external validity of exercise effects.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Due to inconclusive evidence from 
     observational studies regarding the impact of physical activity (PA) 
     and sedentary behavior on frailty and falling risk, we conducted a 
     two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the causal 
     associations between PA, sedentary behavior, and frailty and falls. 
     Methods. We extracted summary data from genome-wide association 
     studies conducted among individuals of European ancestry, 
     encompassing PA (n = 90 667-608 595), sedentary behavior (n = 372 
     609-526 725), frailty index (n = 175 226), and falling risk (n = 451 
     179). Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with accelerometer 
     assessed fraction >425 milligravities, self-reported vigorous 
     activity, moderate to vigorous physical acticity (MVPA), leisure 
     screen time (LST), and sedentary behavior at work were taken as 
     instrumental variables. The causal effects were primarily estimated 
     using inverse variance weighted methods, complemented by several 
     sensitivity and validation analyses. Results. Genetically predicted 
     higher levels of PA were significantly associated with a reduction in 
     the frailty index (accelerometer assessed fraction >425 
     milligravities: β = −0.25, 95% CI = −0.36 to −0.14, p = 1.27 
     × 10−5; self-reported vigorous activity: β = −0.13, 95% CI = 
     −0.20 to −0.05, p = 7.9 × 10−4; MVPA: β = −0.28, 95% CI = 
     −0.40 to −0.16, p = 9.9 × 10−6). Besides, LST was 
     significantly associated with higher frailty index (β = 0.18, 95% CI 
     = 0.14-0.22, p = 5.2 × 10−20) and higher odds of falling (OR = 
     1.13, CI = 1.07-1.19, p = 6.9 × 10−6). These findings remained 
     consistent throughout sensitivity and validation analyses. 
     Conclusions. Our study offers evidence supporting a causal 
     relationship between PA and a reduced risk of frailty. Furthermore, 
     it underscores the association between prolonged LST and an elevated 
     risk of frailty and falls. Therefore, promoting PA and reducing 
     sedentary behavior may be an effective strategy in primary frailty 
     and falls prevention.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. In this single-blinded randomized controlled 
     trial, we compared the "Test in-Train Out" structured home-based 
     exercise program (TiTo-SHB) with the traditional "go home and walk" 
     exercise intervention in people with peripheral artery disease (PAD). 
     Methods. Peripheral artery disease patients at Leriche-Fontaine's 
     stage II were randomized to receive TiTo-SHB or walking advice 
     (C-WA). The TiTo-SHB group performed two daily 8-min sessions of 
     pain-free interval walking at progressive low-to-moderate speed 
     maintained with a metronome. The C-WA group was recommended to walk 
     for 30 min at least three times per week and to endure claudication 
     pain. Outcomes collected at baseline and at the end of the program (6 
     months) included: 6-min and pain-free walking distance (6MWD, PFWD), 
     ankle-brachial index (ABI), 5-time sit-to-stand test (5STS), and 
     health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by the VascuQoL-6 
     questionnaire. Results. A total of 68 patients were randomized (males 
     n = 50; aged 73 ± 9; TiTo-SHB n = 34). At the end of the program, 
     patients in the TiTo-SHB group compared with the C-WA group had 
     significantly improved 6MWD (Δ + 60 ± 32 m vs. Δ − 5 ± 37 m; p 
     < 0.001) and PFWD (Δ + 140 ± 92 m vs. Δ − 7 ± 87 m; p < 0.001). 
     A significant between-group difference in favor of the TiTo-SHB group 
     was also recorded for all the secondary outcomes, including 5STS (Δ 
     − 2.6 ± 1.8 s vs. Δ + 0.8 ± 2.6 s; p < 0.001), ABI of the more 
     impaired limb (Δ + 0.10 ± 0.11 vs. Δ + 0.02 ± 0.08; p = 0.003), 
     and VascuQoL-6 score (Δ +2 ± 2 vs. −1 ± 4; p < 0.001). 
     Conclusion. In PAD patients with claudication, the pain-free in-home 
     TiTo-SHB program was more effective in improving exercise capacity 
     and HRQoL than the traditional walking advice recommendation.]

     AB: Abstract. Ankle inversion orientation and peroneal activation 
     insufficiency may contribute to lateral ankle sprains during landing 
     in chronic ankle instability (CAI); however, how anticipation alters 
     these factors is neglected. This study aimed to assess the impact of 
     anticipation on joint orientation and muscle activity during landing 
     in individuals with CAI. Fifteen participants with CAI and 15 healthy 
     participants (control) were recruited to perform single-leg landings 
     after bilateral countermovement jumps when the landing limb was 
     specified before (planned) or after (unplanned) take-off. Joint angle 
     (hip, knee, and ankle) and electromyography (gluteus medius, rectus 
     femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius lateral head, tibialis 
     anterior, and peroneal longus) were collected and analyzed with 2 
     (groups) × 2 (conditions) statistical parametric mapping ANOVA. In 
     the unplanned condition, the CAI group demonstrated a less 
     plantarflexed (maximum difference [MD] = 9.5°, p = 0.047) and more 
     inverted ankle joint (MD = 4.1°, p < 0.001) before ground contact, 
     along with lower peroneal activity at ground contact compared to the 
     control group (MD = 28.9% of peak activation, p < 0.001). No 
     significant differences between groups were observed in the planned 
     condition. In conclusion, anticipation may mask jump landing deficits 
     in people with CAI, including inverted ankle orientation and reduced 
     peroneus longus activity pre- and post-landing, which were observed 
     exclusively in unplanned landings. Clinicians and researchers need to 
     recognize the impact of anticipation on apparent landing deficits and 
     consider the implications for injury prevention and rehabilitation 
     strategies.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. To determine if adolescents with 
     patellofemoral pain exhibit different biomechanical characteristics 
     to asymptomatic adolescents during walking and running. Methods. 
     Twenty-eight adolescents with patellofemoral pain (16 male, 12 
     female, mean [SD] age: 14.3 [1.7] years) and 24 asymptomatic 
     adolescents (13 male, 11 female, mean [SD] age: 14.1 [1.6] years) 
     participated. Participants walked and ran on an instrumented 
     treadmill in a standardized athletic shoe. Continuous hip, knee, and 
     ankle joint angles and moments, and frontal plane pelvic motion were 
     compared between groups using one-dimensional statistical parametric 
     mapping independent t-tests (alpha <0.05). Cadence and stride length 
     were compared between groups using independent t-tests. Results. 
     During walking, adolescents with patellofemoral pain had a higher hip 
     extension moment at 7%-8% of the gait cycle (p = 0.04) and walked 
     with a shorter stride length (mean difference [95% confidence 
     interval] = −0.07 [−0.1, −0.01] m). There were no other 
     differences between groups during walking. During running, 
     adolescents with patellofemoral pain had greater knee flexion than 
     asymptomatic adolescents at 35%-40% of the gait cycle (p = 0.04) and 
     ran with a higher cadence (mean difference [95% confidence interval] 
     = 5.8 [2.0, 9.5] steps/min). There were no other statistically 
     significant differences between groups during running. Conclusions. 
     Adolescents with patellofemoral pain demonstrate few biomechanical 
     differences to asymptomatic adolescents during walking and running. 
     The identified differences are likely of limited clinical importance. 
     Biomechanical alterations which have been previously associated with 
     patellofemoral pain in adults, may not need to be the target of 
     management of adolescent patellofemoral pain.]

     AB: Abstract. Upper-limb occupational exoskeletons to support the 
     workers' upper arms are typically designed to provide 
     antigravitational support. Although typical work activities require 
     workers to perform static and dynamic actions, the majority of the 
     studies in literature investigated the effects of upper-limb 
     occupational exoskeletons in static and quasi-static activities, 
     while only a few works focused on dynamic tasks. This article 
     presents a systematic evaluation of the effects of different levels 
     of antigravitational support (from about 60% to 100% of the arm 
     gravitational load) provided by a passive upper-limb occupational 
     exoskeleton on muscles' activity during repetitive arm movements. The 
     effect of the exoskeleton on muscle activity was evaluated by the 
     comparison of muscle activations with and without the exoskeleton. 
     The average muscle activation was computed considering shoulder full 
     flexion-extension cycles, and sub-movements, namely the arm-lifting 
     (i.e. flexion) and arm-lowering (i.e. extension) movements. Results 
     showed a quasi-linear correlation between antigravitational support 
     and muscle activity reductions, both when considering the full 
     flexion-extension cycle and in the arm-lifting movement (reductions 
     were up to 64 and 61% compared to not wearing the exoskeleton, 
     respectively). When considering the arm-lowering movement, providing 
     antigravitational support close to or higher than 100% of the arm 
     gravitational load led to increased muscle activations of the 
     extensors (up to 127%), suggesting that such an amount of 
     antigravitational support may be not effective for a complete 
     biomechanical load reduction on the shoulder district in dynamic 
     tasks.]

     bias and the overall certainty of evidence was low. Meta-analyses 
     demonstrated a significant decrease of neck pain intensity and 
     disability for strengthening exercises compared to a control (p < 
     0.01). Conclusion. There is low certainty of evidence that 
     strengthening of the neck, shoulder and scapular musculature is 
     effective at reducing neck pain and disability in office workers. 
     Further research evaluating the effect of exercise on QoL is 
     required.]

     AB: Abstract. Backpacks are common devices for carrying external 
     posterior loads. However, relatively little is known about how these 
     external loads affect the ability to recover from balance loss. In 
     this exploratory investigation, 16 young adults (8 female, 8 male) 
     performed forward and backward lean-and-release balance recovery 
     trials, while wearing a backpack that was unloaded or loaded (at 15% 
     of individual body weight). We quantified the effects of backpack 
     loading on balance recovery in terms of maximum recoverable lean 
     angles, center-of-mass kinematics, and temporal-spatial stepping 
     characteristics. Mean values of maximum lean angles were 20° and 9° 
     in response to forward and backward perturbations, respectively. 
     These angles significantly decreased when wearing the additional load 
     for only backward losses of balance. During backward losses of 
     balance, the additional load decreased peak center-of-mass velocity 
     and increased acceleration by ~10 and 18% respectively, which was 
     accompanied by ~5% faster stepping responses and steps that were 
     ~9% longer, 11% higher, and had an ~10% earlier onset. Thus, 
     wearing a backpack decreases backward balance recovery ability and 
     changes backward recovery stepping characteristics.]

     AB: Abstract. This systematic review summarizes the evidence on 
     associations between physical and psychosocial work-related exposures 
     and the development of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Relevant 
     databases were searched up to January 2020 for cohort studies 
     reporting associations between work-related physical or psychosocial 
     risk factors and the incidence of CTS. Two independent reviewers 
     selected eligible studies, extracted relevant data, and assessed risk 
     of bias (RoB). We identified fourteen articles for inclusion which 
     reported data from nine cohort studies. Eight reported associations 
     between physical exposure and the incidence of CTS and five reported 
     associations between psychosocial exposures and the incidence of CTS. 
     Quality items were generally rated as unclear or low RoB. 
     Work-related physical exposure factors including high levels of 
     repetition, velocity, and a combination of multiple physical 
     exposures were associated with an increased risk of developing CTS. 
     No other consistent associations were observed for physical or 
     psychosocial exposures at work and CTS incidence.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. This study aims to investigate the impact 
     of neuromuscular training (NMT) on static and dynamic postural 
     balance (PB) among high-level male runners with intellectual 
     disability. Method. Twenty-seven runners were randomly assigned to a 
     NMT group and a control group who maintained their conventional 
     training. Static and dynamic PB were assessed using the centre of 
     pressure (CoP) excursions (in bipedal and unipedal stances under open 
     eyes (OE) and closed eyes (CE) conditions) and the star excursion 
     balance test (SEBT), respectively, at pre-training and post-training. 
     Results. The NMT group showed significantly (p < 0.05) decreased CoP 
     values and increased SEBT scores at post-training compared to 
     pre-training. The switch from OE to CE did not affect static PB in 
     the bipedal stance, only in the NMT group. Conclusions. The NMT was 
     effective in improving static and dynamic PB in runners with 
     intellectual disability. The NMT could reduce visual dependency.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Only about 9% of individuals with 
     intellectual disabilities reach the government's physical activity 
     (PA) recommendations. Combining gamification and technology seems 
     particularly promising in overcoming personal and environmental 
     barriers to PA participation. Method. Eighteen adults with varying 
     levels of intellectual disabilities completed a pilot study to assess 
     the initial effects of a cycling gamification intervention on levels 
     of PA, fitness, psychosocial outcomes, and challenging behaviours. 
     The study comprised three designs: pre-post single group, AB 
     single-case, and qualitative. Social validity, implementation 
     barriers and facilitators were also explored. Results. Nearly all 18 
     participants cycled daily. Time and distance cycled daily increase 
     during the intervention while a decrease in stereotyped behaviours 
     was observed. Participants and staff found the intervention enjoyable 
     and socially valid. Conclusions. Results of the multiple-design study 
     suggest that gamification interventions may be a suitable, enjoyable, 
     and promising way to contribute to PA participation of adults with 
     intellectual disabilities.]

     Method. A cross-sectional community-based survey including 214 adult 
     participants (56% men) with intellectual disabilities. Results. In 
     our sample, 25% had no organised day activity, 27% attended non-work 
     day care, 19% attended sheltered employment, or day care with 
     production, without pay and 29% worked in paid sheltered employment. 
     One participant attended mainstream employment. Moderate and 
     severe/profound level of intellectual disability, possible organic 
     condition and irritability significantly reduced the odds of

     six evidence-based tools were implemented in 10 care services 
     specialised in care for people with intellectual disabilities. 
     Contextual differences were taken into account by using a 
     participatory action research approach. Method. The RE-AIM framework 
     (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) 
     structured the evaluation. Data sources were online questionnaires 
     completed by 299 professionals at baseline (response 45.2%) and 250 
     professionals after 2.5 years (35.1%), 11 semi-structured group 
     interviews with 43 professionals, field notes and implementation 
     plans. Results. A total of 767 professionals and 43 teams were 
     reached. The effectiveness of the intervention was demonstrated in an 
     improved knowledge of palliative care policy and increased 
     competences among professionals. 79% of the professionals adopted 
     tools in the toolbox. The participatory action research method was

     AB: Abstract. Background: Experts suggest implementing measures that 
     include analgesia, sedation, delirium prevention and early 
     mobilization (ASDM) in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation 
     (MV) to reduce complications. However, there is limited evidence of 
     occupational therapy in these patients. The aim of the research is to 
     compare functional independence in patients undergoing MV of an 
     intensive and early occupational therapy protocol versus to standard 
     ASDM strategy. Method/. Design: A prospective, multicenter, 
     randomized clinical trial, with parallel groups (control and 
     intervention groups). Participants will be hospitalized patients, 
     over 18 years of age, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 
     with the need of invasive MV. The intervention group will receive two 
     daily 30-minute sessions of occupational therapy for 10 days. This 
     study will research the effect of occupational therapy on functional 
     independence, motor and cognitive status, evaluating at days 28 and 
     90. Discussion: This work contributes to the theoretical and 
     practical work of occupational therapists who work in the ICU. The 
     implementation of protocols of occupational therapy in mechanically 
     ventilated patients can contribute to the independence and 
     functionality of patients. Conclusion: Our research aims to 
     contribute to the generation of systematized, organized, and feasible 
     protocols that can be implemented in ICU.]

     patients' pre- and post-operative knee disability, functional status, 
     and length of hospital stay after surgery between patients with and 
     without using a walking aid. Methods: One-hundred forty-five patients 
     were enrolled and divided into four groups based on whether they used 
     any walking aids before surgery: no walking aid, one cane, one elbow 
     crutch, and two elbow crutches. The groups were compared for knee 
     disability (Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score), 
     functional status (Iowa Level of Assistance Scale (ILAS)), and length 
     of hospital stay. Results: For the pre-operative HSS knee scores, no 
     statistically significant differences were found between the groups 
     (p > 0.05). For the pre-operative ILAS scores, the patients without 
     using walking aids had better functional status than those using any 
     walking aids (p < 0.05). For the post-operative outcomes, no 
     statistically significant differences were found between the groups 
     in the HSS knee and the ILAS scores and length of hospital stay after 
     surgery. Conclusion: In this population, using any walking aids 
     before surgery is related to worse pre-operative functional status 
     but not to the pre-operative knee disability. Furthermore, it is not 
     related to the short-term outcomes after surgery.]

     initiate early falls prevention and management strategies. This study 
     identified the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors of patients who 
     experience early inpatient falls (within 48 hours of admission). 
     Method: A retrospective case-control study was completed at a 
     tertiary hospital. Data were extracted from medical records. Adults 
     aged 18 years and older, admitted with any diagnosis, to any ward 
     within the hospital between July 2019 and June 2020 were included. 
     Cases were identified as those who fell within 48 hours of admission 
     and controls did not experience a fall. Results: The study sample 
     included 218 patients (109 cases and 109 control patients). Most 
     falls occurred in the patient's room (n = 54) or bathroom (n = 47), 
     as a result of slipping (n = 50) or while patients were toileting (n 
     = 32). Multivariate regression analysis identified significant 
     predictors of inpatient falls, including unassisted mobilisation 
     (odds ratio (OR) 5.25), impaired balance (OR 7.25), reduced muscle 
     strength (OR 5.25) and impulsivity (OR 19.57). Receiving occupational 
     therapy reduced risk of falling by 81%. Conclusion: Falls risk 
     factors that are predictive of early inpatient falls should be 
     identified at admission and used to prioritise patients for 
     occupational therapy.]

     Method: The adaptation process followed the guidelines 'Translation 
     and Adaptation of Instruments' and 'Cross-Cultural Adaptation of Self 
     Report'. A forward and backward translation was performed. Three 
     authors of the original EMAS were in close contact. Pretesting and 
     cognitive interviews were performed on a sample of 10 chronically ill 
     individuals. Psychometric analysis of survey data, collected during 
     the COVID-19 lockdown (N = 1938 Belgian adults, Flemish speaking), 
     was performed. Internal consistency, factorial validity and construct 
     validity were examined. Results: The adaptation process involved an 
     accurate analysis of the items of the EMAS by the expert panel and 
     EMAS authors. The EMAS-VL showed high reliability (Cronbach's α = 
     0.91). Exploratory factor analysis discerned an interpretable 
     two-factorial structure of the EMAS-VL. As hypothesized, moderate 
     associations were found between GHQ-12 (r = −0.57) and CD-RISC (r = 
     0.50) so the EMAS-VL possesses satisfactory construct validity as 
     well. Conclusion: EMAS-VL is shown to be a reliable and valid 
     instrument for evaluating meaning in activities in Flanders.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has 
     caused some major changes in occupational patterns that form part of 
     the individual's occupational identity. Due to debilitating symptoms, 
     post-COVID-19 survivors with limitations in the occupational 
     performance areas may experience occupational imbalance. The 
     objective of this study was to investigate the methods employed by 
     patients to engage in their daily activities for regaining 
     occupational balance. Methods: The study used an interpretive 
     paradigm and conventional content analysis. An in-depth 
     semi-structured interview was conducted with 11 patients who had been 
     hospitalized due to COVID-19 in the past 6 months or less, along with 
     their three primary caregivers residing in Tehran. The sampling 
     method used was purposive and continued until conceptual saturation 
     was reached. Participants with the most tremendous possible diversity 
     in demographic variables were included. Data were analyzed using 
     Corbin and Strauss's recommended Constant Comparative Analysis. 
     Results: The findings showed that patients used different strategies 
     which included self-treatment based on others' recommendations, 
     compensatory, fatigue prevention and adaptive strategies to restore 
     occupational balance. Conclusion: As occupational therapists, we must 
     understand post-COVID-19 survivors' perspectives on occupations and 
     their preferred strategies. Also, findings confirm that occupational 
     balance is a dynamic process that the adaptive capacities of the 
     patients help to restore occupational balance.]

     difference observed between the TIA and Control groups. Furthermore, 
     within the AIS group, the expression of miRNA-21-5p was found to be 
     significantly increased in the poor prognosis subgroup (mRS 3-6 
     points) compared to the good prognosis subgroup (mRS 0-2 points) (P < 
     .05). The area under the curve (AUC) of miRNA-21-5p for predicting 
     AIS from TIA and 30-day poor prognosis of AIS were 0.710 and 0.641, 
     respectively. Additionally, miRNA-21-5p showed positive correlations 
     with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and 
     modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of AIS patients, respectively. 
     Conclusions: • Serum miRNA-21-5p levels exhibit considerable 
     potential as a promising biomarker. They play a crucial role in 
     distinguishing between AIS and TIA. Additionally, these levels offer 
     valuable predictive insights into the severity and short-term 
     prognosis of AIS.]

     AB: Background: • Despite growing interest in nutrition as a 
     behavioral intervention to improve cognitive health in clinical 
     populations, many providers find it challenging to provide specific 
     nutritional recommendations. We aimed to review and synthesize 
     current empirical research on this topic and provide considerations 
     for healthcare providers working with adults who wish to optimize 
     their cognition via dietary improvements. Methods: • We performed a 
     narrative review of research published between January 2009 and May 
     2021 on 5 popular dietary interventions: the Mediterranean diet, 
     Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), the 
     Mediterranean-DASH. Intervention: Diet for Neurodegenerative Delay 
     (MIND), the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Results and. 
     Conclusions: • Of the 5 dietary interventions, the Mediterranean 
     diet has been the most extensively investigated, and there is 
     evidence supporting its cognitive benefits. However, 
     operationalization of the Mediterranean diet varies across studies, 
     rendering the results inconclusive. The DASH diet and the MIND diet 
     have stronger operationalization and showed evidence of cognitive 
     benefits. More longitudinal studies and/or randomized clinical trials 
     should be conducted on these 2 relatively new interventions. Finally, 
     there is limited research with human participants regarding the 
     ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, which are found to be 
     cognitively protective within stringent parameters. Definitions for 
     these 5 dietary patterns and practice tips and recommendations are 
     provided.]

     AB: Context • Dementia is the cognitive decline of patients, who 
     often exhibit behavioral and psychological symptoms, severely 
     affecting their quality of life (QoL) and placing a heavy burden on 
     caregivers. Studies have found that acupressure can have benefits for 
     individuals with dementia. Objective: • The review intended to 
     critically analyze the currently available evidence on the use of 
     acupressure as a nonpharmacological therapy for people with dementia, 
     based on results from available clinical trials. Design: • The 
     research team performed an evidence-based review between March and 
     June 2020, following a systematic search strategy, to find human 
     clinical trials using acupressure as an intervention for dementia 
     patients. For the search, the research team used major research 
     databases-Pubmed, EBSCOhost, PsycInfo, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of 
     Science, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL Plus. Setting: • The study 
     was conducted through remote collaboration coordinated through 
     Charles Sturt University Bathurst campus in Australia. Participants 
     • The 12 clinical trials included 973 participants, with the pooled 
     mean age being 81.10 ± 6.74 and 48.2% being males and 51.8% females. 
     Intervention: • The reviewed studies evaluated acupressure as an 
     intervention for dementia patients. Outcome Measures • The team 
     synthesized the review results to examine the effects of acupressure 
     on various outcome measures of interest for dementia. Results: • 
     Twelve clinical trials (N = 973), including eight randomized 
     controlled studies, were included in the review. Participants were 
     predominantly institutionalized residents, with moderate-to-severe 
     dementia. Baihui (GV20), Shenmen (HT7), Fengchi (GB20), Neiguan 
     (PC6), Sanyinjiao (SP6), and Yingtang (EX-HN3) were the most-used 
     acupoints for intervention. The acupressure techniques varied 
     greatly, with no standardized approach being used. The review found 
     inconsistent evidence on the effectiveness of acupressure in reducing 
     agitation and behavioral disturbances, but the treatment appears to 
     improve the ease of care and reduce physical stress. Affixing 
     acupressure devices on selected acupoints can potentially decrease 
     psychiatric pain, anxiety, and depression. Long-term treatment (6 
     months) may improve cognitive function, the ability to perform the 
     activities of daily living, and QoL of patients with mild-to-moderate 
     dementia. The effect of acupressure on sleep disturbances remains 
     unclear. Conclusions: • More high-quality research on acupressure 
     is needed to fill the gaps in knowledge and inform better care for 
     dementia patients in the future.]

     AB: Context • Growth/differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a 
     diagnostic and prognostic marker associated with inflammation, renal 
     damage, and cardiovascular risk in type-2 diabetes mellitus. 
     Researchers have proposed treatment targets that reduce GDF-15 
     levels. Objective: • Our aim in this study is to investigate the 
     effect of major autohemotherapy on GDF-15 levels and to evaluate it 
     as a complementary therapy. Design: • The research team designed a 
     laboratory study to examine the effect of major hemotherapy on GDF-15 
     levels in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus and healthy 
     volunteers. Blood was drawn from the participants in a closed system, 
     infused with ozone gas, and reinfused into the patients. Setting: • 
     The study was carried out from 15 August-5 October at Kirsehir 
     Training and Research Hospital Traditional and Complementary Medicine 
     Center, Turkey. Participants • The study was conducted 
     prospectively, and two groups were formed, consisting of those with 
     type-2 diabetes mellitus (n = 21) and healthy volunteers (n = 14). 
     Outcome Measures • All participants received 10 sessions of major 
     autohemotherapy at a concentration of 25-35 micrograms/milliliter 
     twice a week. Before and after the application, GDF-15, fasting 
     glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and lipid panel levels were studied 
     and compared. Results: • Age, GDF-15, fasting glucose, glycosylated 
     hemoglobin, and triglyceride levels were found to be higher in the 
     type-2 diabetes mellitus group compared to the healthy group, and 
     high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were found to be lower. 
     After major autohemotherapy, GDF-15 and low-density lipoprotein 
     cholesterol decreased significantly in the type-2 diabetes mellitus 
     group. No change was observed in the healthy group. Conclusions: • 
     As a new treatment strategy, major autohemotherapy reduces GDF-15 
     levels in type-2 diabetes mellitus and contributes to the therapeutic 
     effects of ozone therapy.]

     AB: Objective: • This study was undertaken to explore the effects 
     of a bovine colostrum-containing multivitamin multimineral (MVM) 
     supplement on healthy, adult women and men by determining blood 
     chemistries and health parameters via serum and saliva sampling and 
     measuring each subject's physical characteristics over a 12-week 
     interval. Participants • Fifty participants were screened for the 
     study, after which twenty participants were determined eligible to 
     enter the study. Thirteen participants (6 women and 7 men, average 
     age 30.9 years, average BMI 27.3 kg/m2) completed the whole study. 
     Results: • MVM did not significantly impact serum alanine 
     aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
     gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels. The MVM significantly 
     improved serum folate levels (48.3% increase at Week 12: 23.56 ± 
     5.75 ug/mL versus Week 0: 15.88 ± 3.40 ug/mL, P = .0001). MVM 
     improved serum levels of vitamin B12 (21.3% increase at Week 12: 
     789.38 ± 313.23 pg/mL versus Week 0: 650.54 ± 228.02 pg/mL, P = 
     .0690) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels (9.1% increase at Week 12: 
     32.22 ± 5.81 ug/mL versus Week 0: 29.54 ± 11.30 ug/mL, P = .3570). 
     The salivary IgA levels showed a significant increase at Week 4 
     (249.85 ± 95.63 ug/ml), Week 8 (271.65 ± 133.52 ug/ml), and Week 12 
     (279.88 ± 128.19 ug/ml) compared to Week 0 (177.57 ± 74.81 ug/ml). 
     Conclusions: • This study shows that MVM has a good safety and 
     tolerability profile and can be used as a daily nutritional 
     supplement safely. MVM may improve serum levels of vitamin D, folate, 
     vitamin B12, and, possibly, other blood markers. The study showed 
     that MVM may improve secretory IgA levels, a major component of oral 
     immunity. These findings suggest an overall improvement in several 
     aspects of health and need to be confirmed in a larger, 
     placebo-controlled study.]

     Participants • The participants were 120 pregnant women who came to 
     the outpatient clinic for pregnancy follow-ups between June 2021 and 
     October 2021. Intervention: • The participants were allocated to 
     one of three groups, with 40 women in each. For 30 minutes every day, 
     for two weeks, the lullaby group (LG) only listened to lullaby 
     records at home, and the multi-music group (MG) listened to 
     self-selected music from different records; the control group (CG) 
     did not listen to any music. Outcome Measures • The Prenatal 
     Distress Questionnaire and the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale 
     were used to collect data. Results: • Prenatal distress levels were 
     lower in the intervention groups than in the CG (P < .01), and they 
     were lower in the MG than in the LG (P < .05). Antenatal attachment 
     levels were higher in the intervention groups than in the CG (P < 
     .01), and they were higher in the LG than in the MG (P < .05). 
     Conclusions: • For pregnant women, listening to self-selected music 
     was more effective in reducing distress, whereas listening to 
     lullabies selected by the researcher was more effective in increasing 
     attachment.]

     AB: The rapid global emergence of distortions of the senses of smell 
     and taste consequential to COVID-19 has provoked an unprecedented 
     demand for investigation into treatments capable of addressing such 
     medical phenomena. While the pandemic's principal focus rests on 
     interventions intended to prevent the infection and its spread, much 
     attention must be devoted to amelioration of these common symptomatic 
     sequelae of it. The medical historical record reveals a shocking 
     paucity of serious consideration of olfactory and gustatory 
     dysfunction (OGD), hardly exclusive to SARS-CoV-2 infection (as 
     discussed in Part 1 of this article series). To date, no treatment 
     approach has ever delivered noteworthy clinical results for chronic 
     cases. Numerous studies and reviews have addressed the epidemiology 
     and hypotheses of OGD pathophysiology. Past and recent studies have 
     produced vague findings and conclusions devoid of practical clinical 
     applications for patients who continue to experience chronic sensory 
     distortions and deficits. It is urgent that focused exploration be 
     aggressively pursued for therapeutic and restorative modalities to 
     ameliorate OGD across all medical disciplines, with no bias towards 
     any one approach. It is imperative that approaches outside the 
     pharmacological realm are studied; no effective medication of any 
     merit exists. Thus, innovative and new approaches potentially capable 
     of supporting natural self-regulation and restoration of healthy 
     neurophysiology must be investigated, post-haste. Specifically, 
     stimulation of cranial nerves via their auricular branches, by means 
     of various modalities, may hold promise. A vast body of evidence 
     exists to support its investigation. Its inclusion as an extremely 
     safe and inexpensive approach to endeavor to resolve chronic OGD (not 
     merely for post-COVID19 infection) is warranted. The 3-phase 
     auricular acupuncture microsystem may be the most precise form of 
     targeting and positively influencing specific neurological structures 
     affected by COVID-19.]

     Poland. Outcome Measures • The research team analyzed the selected 
     studies to find specific, applicable, and successful monitoring 
     methodology. Results: • The study examined many important aspects 
     of the stay of children in a hospital and of the difficulties that 
     young patients and their families face and identified the most 
     effective monitoring methods for various areas that affect the 
     interests of a child and his or her family within the walls of the 
     hospital. Conclusions: • This review provides direction for medical 
     institutions, allowing the possibility of improving the quality of 
     patient monitoring. Researchers have carried out few studies in 
     pediatric hospitals today, and the field needs further study.]

     AB: Objective: • This study aims to investigate the role of decorin 
     in the adhesion process of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (T. 
     pallidum) to human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Methods: 
     • The study involved an in vitro experimental design. Western blot 
     analysis was conducted to determine the protein expression level of 
     decorin in the cells. The cells were divided into four groups: Tp 
     group, inactivated Tp group, LPS group, and negative control group. 
     The adhesion of T. pallidum to the cells was analyzed using darkfield 
     microscopy counting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
     (qPCR). The cells were divided into four groups based on different 
     preprocessing treatments: control group, decorin group, DCN-siRNA 
     group, and DCN-siRNA+decorin group. Changes in the F-actin of the 
     cells were explored using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The 
     cells were divided into the Tp group, Tp+decorin group, and control 
     group. Results: • Western blot analysis showed high expression of 
     decorin in the Tp group and LPS group. Darkfield microscopy counting 
     revealed a significantly higher number of T. pallidum adhered to a 
     single cell in the decorin group compared to the control group. 
     Conversely, the number of adhered T. pallidum was significantly lower 
     in the DCN-siRNA group compared to the control group. qPCR results 
     indicated a considerably higher T. pallidum load in the decorin group 
     compared to the control group. In the Tp group, T. pallidum treatment 
     induced the reorganization of F-actin, while the distribution of 
     F-actin in the Tp+decorin group was comparable to that of the control 
     group. Conclusions: • Decorin enhances the adhesion of T. pallidum 
     to human brain microvascular endothelial cells, suggesting that 
     decorin may act as one of the receptors regulating the adhesion of T. 
     pallidum to cells. Furthermore, T. pallidum treatment triggers the 
     rearrangement of F-actin in cells, and decorin plays a protective 
     role in this process.]

     (e.g. MMSE, MoCA, ADL, CDT, overall efficacy) were analyzed. Results: 
     • Three systematic evaluations were assessed using AMSTAR 2. Two 
     were low quality, one moderate. Limited rigor in two studies led to 
     considering only medium-quality papers for evidence grading. Key 
     indicators in RCTs included MMSE (eight studies), MoCA (seven 
     studies), ADL (two studies), CDT (two studies), and overall efficacy 
     (12 studies). GRADE evaluation revealed moderate, high, and high 
     evidence quality for intervention efficacy at one, two, and three 
     months respectively. MMSE evidence was low, MoCA high, ADL very low, 
     and CDT moderate. Adverse events were reported in one publication, 
     suggesting acupuncture's potential pain and resistance. Conclusions: 
     • Non-pharmacological interventions, like acupuncture, cognitive 
     exercises, and exercise, show promise in mild cognitive impairment 
     among the elderly. They enhance cognitive function and daily living 
     while maintaining safety. Acupuncture notably improves MoCA scores, 
     supported by robust evidence.]

     AB: Objective: • This study aimed to investigate the impact of 
     integrating medical nursing with targeted functional training 
     interventions on neurological and limb motor function and self-care 
     ability in patients diagnosed with cerebral hemorrhage. Methods: • 
     A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 100 patients 
     diagnosed with cerebral hemorrhage who received interventions at our 
     hospital between January 2020 and June 2022. The patients were 
     divided into two groups: the research group (50 cases) and the 
     reference group (50 cases), based on different intervention methods. 
     The reference group received targeted functional training 
     intervention, while the research group implemented the integration of 
     medical nursing in addition to the reference group intervention. 
     Differences in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 
     score, Barthel index, Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score, Glasgow 
     Coma Scale (GCS) score, Edinburgh Speech Scale (ESS) score, 
     Fugl-Meyer score, Ability of Daily Living (ADL) score, and efficacy 
     evaluation were observed and compared between the two groups of 
     patients. Results: • After nursing, the Fugl-Meyer score and 
     Barthel index score were significantly higher in both groups compared 
     to before nursing, with the research group showing higher scores than 
     the reference group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference 
     in limb motor function scores between the two groups before nursing 
     (P > 0.05). After the integrated nursing intervention, the NIHSS and 
     ADL scores of both groups were significantly higher than before 
     nursing, with the research group demonstrating higher scores than the 
     reference group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: • Integrating medical 
     nursing with targeted functional training interventions has the 
     potential to significantly improve cognitive function, neurological 
     function, and daily activity engagement in patients with cerebral 
     hemorrhage, thereby enhancing their overall quality of life.]

     AB: Content • Metabolic fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a common 
     chronic liver disease, and its incidence is increasing year by year. 
     The existing treatments mainly include drugs, surgery, and lifestyle 
     interventions. At present, no effective treatment exists for the 
     disease. Objective: • The review intended to examine the progress 
     of research on MAFLD in recent years, to find a future research 
     direction and focus and identify different therapeutic targets in the 
     treatment of patients. Design: • The research team performed a 
     narrative review by searching Pubmed databases. The search used the 
     keywords including metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), 
     non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic 
     steatohepatitis (NASH), metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), 
     metabolic syndrome, liver, fibrosis, and lipotoxicity. Results: • 
     The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the recent 
     research advancements in the treatment of MAFLD from three 
     perspectives: drug therapy, surgical treatment, and 
     non-drug/non-surgical treatment. The aim is to identify future 
     research directions and key areas of focus in the management of 
     MAFLD, as well as to determine various treatment targets for 
     patients. Conclusions: • Given the complexity of MAFLD's 
     pathogenesis, drug therapy alone isn't ideal. In caring for patients 
     with fatty liver, clinicians must emphasize a change in lifestyle to 
     a healthier one. At the same time, clinicians, dieticians, 
     psychological experts, and exercise physiologists should provide, in 
     addition to clinical medication, multidisciplinary and cooperative 
     efforts to help patients improve the quality of their lives through 
     diet and exercise to control disease progression.]

     units. This is a quasi-experimental study planned to determine the 
     effect of the meditation based mandala programme on distress, anxiety 
     and depression in caregivers of cancer patients in a palliative care 
     unit. Planned as a single-group pre-test/post-test design, with a 
     total of 11 caregivers. Data were collected with the Caregiver 
     Diagnosis Form, Distress Thermometer, Beck Depression Inventory, and 
     Beck Anxiety Inventory. Caregivers participated in the Meditation 
     Based Mandala Programme once a week, which lasted 2 hours for 5 
     weeks. The distress, depression and anxiety levels of the patients 
     were measured before the programme started and at the end of the 
     programme. Meditation based mandala programme is effective in 
     reducing the distress, depression and anxiety levels of caregivers of 
     cancer patients in the palliative care unit.]

     AB: Purpose: Regulatory bodies impose continuing professional 
     development (CPD) requirements on health care professionals (HCPs) as 
     a condition for license revalidation. Many regulatory bodies require 
     annual evidence of CPD activities that are informed by reflective 
     practices, guided by learning plans, and compiled into a portfolio. 
     The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize the literature 
     discussing how regulatory bodies use portfolios with evidence of 
     reflection for licensure renewal. Method: We reviewed 
     English-language articles published until May 2020 discussing 
     evidence of CPD and reflective practice in portfolios in the context 
     of licensure renewal. Results: We located 17 articles for the review. 
     None reported or measured outcomes beyond submission of reflective 
     evidence. Sixteen articles (93%) included information about passive 
     learning resources that regulatory bodies provided to help guide 
     HCPs' reflective learning activities. HCPs' feedback about using 
     reflective learning activities indicated mixed opinions about their 
     utility. Conclusions: Few publications reported how jurisdictions 
     expected HCPs to provide evidence of reflective practices for 
     licensure renewal. None of the regulatory bodies required evidence 
     regarding the impact of reflective practice on patient or 
     organizational outcomes. HCPs reported both benefits and challenges 
     of a mandated reflective process.]

     whether a difference exists between levels of satisfaction among 
     patients examined by advanced practice physiotherapists (APPs) and 
     orthopaedic surgeons (OSs), and explore patients' experiences with 
     being examined by APPs. Method: One hundred and thirty-three patients 
     participated in a cross-sectional questionnaire study using the 
     Visit-Specific Satisfaction Instrument (VSQ-9). Primary outcome was 
     satisfaction with "The visit overall" (item 9). Nine patients 
     participated in semi-structured interviews, which were thematically 
     analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference in 
     satisfaction with "The visit overall" between patients examined by an 
     OS (median: 75, 1st-3rd quartiles: 75-100) and an APP (median: 100, 
     1st-3rd quartiles: 75-100). The VSQ-9 total score was not 
     significantly different between groups, but some items regarding 
     direct interaction with the health provider were scored significantly 
     higher in the APP group. Patients were particularly satisfied with 
     APPs' ability to explain during the consultation. Conclusions: The 
     results showed high levels of satisfaction with examinations 
     performed by both OSs and APPs with no difference between groups 
     concerning "The visit overall." From a patient perspective, the 
     results support the use of APPs to examine and diagnose selected 
     patients in an orthopaedic outpatient shoulder clinic.]

     AB: Purpose: The Pain Science Division (PSD) is a special interest 
     group of the Canadian Physiotherapy Association that serves 
     physiotherapists who have an interest in better understanding and 
     managing patients' pain. The PSD developed evidence-based resources 
     for its members with the goal of improving patient care by supporting 
     professional development. However, online metrics tracking access to 
     these resources indicated that access was low. The purpose of this 
     study was to identify the barriers PSD members encountered to the use 
     of PSD resources and to recommend interventions to address these 
     barriers guided by the Theory and Techniques Tool (TTT). Method: We 
     distributed an online survey to PSD members across Canada. We used 
     the TTT, a knowledge translation tool, to guide the design of the 
     questionnaire and identify actionable findings. Results: Response 
     rates from 621 non-student members and 1,470 student members were 
     26.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Based on the frequency of practising 
     physiotherapists' (n = 167) agreement with items in the TTT, the 
     primary barriers to use of the PSD resources were forgetting that the 
     resources were available and forgetting to use them. Conclusions: The 
     TTT can be used to identify barriers to use of professional 
     development tools.]

     describe physiotherapists' current use of resistance exercise (REx) 
     with older adults in acute care and to identify barriers to its use 
     with this population. Methods: We developed an online questionnaire 
     guided by the theoretical domains framework and distributed it to 
     physiotherapists across British Columbia. We used thematic analysis 
     to code open-text questionnaire responses. Results: One hundred and 
     five physiotherapists completed the questionnaire (78% female; mean 
     age 39.9 [SD 10.3] y; mean years of experience 12.4 [SD 10.3] y). 
     Respondents reported frequently performing functional testing (95%) 
     and assessing muscle strength (70%) in older adults, but few often 
     prescribed REx (34%). The greatest barriers to use of REx that 
     respondents identified were lack of prioritization of REx among other 
     duties and perceived poor patient motivation. Open-text data analysis 
     revealed that respondents felt that some patients were unable to 
     perform REx and that physiotherapists lacked a clear definition of 
     REx and sufficient support personnel. Conclusions: Addressing 
     treatment priorities, patient motivation, and staffing resources can 
     support physiotherapists in increasing REx use, an important strategy 
     for reducing the incidence of hospital-associated deconditioning 
     among older adults in acute care settings.]

     AB: Purpose: The capacity to recover motor function with pathology or 
     age-related decline is termed physical resilience. It is unknown what 
     outcome domains are captured with existing measurement instruments. 
     Thus, this scoping review aimed to identify measurement instruments 
     for physical resilience, identify research gaps, and make 
     recommendations for future research. Methods: Articles were included 
     from the search when their subject matter included the term 
     resilience in relation to the physical health of older adults. Data 
     on physical resilience measurement instruments were extracted using 
     the outcome domains: body function or structure, activity and 
     participation, and societal impact. Results: The majority of the 33 
     included articles involved older adults with fractures, cardiac 
     conditions, and cancer. Many measurement instruments quantified body 
     function or structure, and some instruments captured activity and 
     participation, and societal impact of physical resilience. 
     Measurement instruments were pooled into 4 categories: psychological, 
     physiological, motor function, and psychosocial scales. No studies 
     combined all areas of measurement. Conclusions: A potential gap of a 
     measurement instrument capturing social aspects of physical 
     resilience was identified. Comprehensive measurement could identify 
     which outcome domains could be targeted to foster resilience. This 
     knowledge might be useful across many health disciplines and 
     contribute to therapeutic decision-making and rehabilitation 
     strategies.]

     AB: Purpose: Both private and public funding cover outpatient 
     physiotherapy (PT) in Canada. Knowledge is lacking in who does and 
     does not access PT services, which limits the ability to identify 
     health/access inequities created by current financing structures. 
     This study characterizes the individuals accessing private PT in 
     Winnipeg to better understand whether inequities exist, given the 
     very limited publicly financed PT. Methods: Patients attending PT in 
     32 private businesses, sampled for geographic variation, completed a 
     survey online or on paper. We compared the sample's demographic 
     characteristics with Winnipeg population data using chi-square 
     goodness-of-fit tests. Results: In total, 665 adults accessing PT 
     participated. Respondents were older and had higher levels of income 
     and education compared to Winnipeg census data (p < 0.001). Our 
     sample included higher proportions of female and White individuals, 
     and lower proportions of Indigenous persons, newcomers, and people 
     from visible minorities (p < 0.001). Conclusions: There are signs 
     that inequities exist in access to PT in Winnipeg; the cohort who 
     access private PT services does not reflect the wider population, 
     which suggests that some segments of the population are not receiving 
     care.]

     AB: Purpose: This scoping review aimed to identify which clinical 
     tests are used to assess upper limb, lower limb, and trunk motor 
     coordination, and their metric and measurement properties for adult 
     neurological populations. Method: MEDLINE (1946-) and EMBASE (1996-) 
     databases were searched using keywords such as movement quality, 
     motor performance, motor coordination, assessment, and psychometrics. 
     Data regarding the body part assessed, neurological condition, 
     psychometric properties, and scored metrics of spatial and/or 
     temporal coordination were independently extracted by two reviewers. 
     Alternate versions of some tests such as the Finger-to-Nose Test were 
     included. Results: Fifty-one included articles yielded 2 tests 
     measuring spatial coordination, 7 tests measuring temporal 
     coordination, and 10 tests measuring both. Scoring metrics and 
     measurement properties differed between tests, with a majority of 
     tests having good-to-excellent measurement properties. Conclusions: 
     The metrics of motor coordination scored by current tests vary. Since 
     tests do not assess functional task performance, the onus falls on 
     clinicians to infer the connection between coordination impairments 
     and functional deficits. Clinical practice would benefit from the 
     development of a battery of tests that assesses the metrics of 
     coordination related to functional performance.]

     AB: Purpose: The main objective was to assess the feasibility of 
     conducting a full randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the 
     effectiveness of the OA Go Away (OGA) behavioural intervention on 
     adherence to prescribed exercise, level of physical activity, goal 
     attainment, and health outcomes, and to determine the acceptability 
     of the OGA. The OGA is an internal reinforcement tool designed to 
     promote exercise adherence for people with hip or knee OA. Method: 
     This 3-month pragmatic pilot RCT included 40 participants with hip or 
     knee OA who were randomized into the treatment group who used the OGA 
     for three months, or standard care. Results: This pilot RCT which 
     included 37 participants (17 in the treatment group and 20 in the 
     control group) showed that it would be feasible to complete a full 
     RCT of the OGA behavioural intervention with adjustments to the 
     format of the OGA (electronic), inclusion criteria, outcome measures 
     and duration. The OGA was felt to be useful (75%) and motivational 
     (82%) by participants. Conclusions: This pilot RCT justifies a formal 
     RCT of the OGA and shows promising results concerning its 
     acceptability, especially if available in an electronic format.]

     AB: Abstract. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), as one of the 
     crystallizations of Chinese wisdom, emphasizes the balance of Yin and 
     Yang to keep the body healthy. Under the theoretical guidance of a 
     holistic view, the diagnostic process in TCM has characteristics of 
     subjectivity, fuzziness, and complexity. Therefore, realizing 
     standardization and achieving objective quantitative analysis are the 
     bottlenecks of the development of TCM. The emergence of artificial 
     intelligence (AI) technology has brought unprecedented challenges and 
     opportunities to traditional medicine, which is expected to provide 
     objective measurements and improve the clinical efficacy. However, 
     the combination of TCM and AI is still in its infancy and currently 
     faces many challenges. Therefore, this review provides a 
     comprehensive discussion of the existing advances, problems, and 
     prospects of the applications of AI technologies in TCM with the hope 
     of promoting a better understanding of the TCM modernization and 
     intellectualization.]

     AB: Abstract. Ginseng is a very commonly used natural product in the 
     world, and its two main species are Asian ginseng and American 
     ginseng. Ginseng is an adaptogenic botanical that reportedly protects 
     the body against stress, stabilizes physiological processes, and 
     restores homeostasis. Previously, different animal models and 
     contemporary research methodologies have been used to reveal 
     ginseng's biomedical activities in different body systems and the 
     linked mechanisms of actions. However, human clinical observation 
     data on ginseng effects have attracted more attention from the 
     general public and medical community. In this paper, after an 
     introduction of the phytochemistry of ginseng species, we review 
     positive ginseng clinical studies, mainly conducted in developed 
     countries, performed over the past 20 years. The reported effects of 
     ginseng are presented in several sections, and conditions impacted by 
     ginseng include diabetes; cardiovascular disorders; cognition, 
     memory, and mood; the common cold and flu; cancer fatigue and 
     well-being; quality of life and social functioning, etc. 
     Administration of ginseng demonstrated a good safety record in 
     humans. Although encouraging beneficial effects obtained from 
     clinical data, using the study treatment regimen, the reported 
     ginseng effects in general only ranged from mild to moderate. 
     Nonetheless, these beneficial effects of ginseng could be a valuable 
     add-on therapy for patients receiving standard drug treatments. 
     Additionally, as a dietary supplement, ginseng possesses an important 
     role in maintaining and promoting human health. We believe that the 
     quality of future ginseng trials should be improved, particularly by 
     providing detailed herbal phytochemistry and quality control 
     information. With solid effectiveness data obtained from a 
     well-designed, carefully executed ginseng clinical trial, this 
     meritoriously herbal medicine will be widely used by consumers and 
     patients.]

     AB: Abstract. Fermentation is a processing method used in traditional 
     Chinese medicine (TCM). However, traditional fermentation methods 
     suffer from poor production control. In contrast, probiotic fermented 
     herbal medicine (PFHM) offers advantages such as the use of pure 
     strains, a controllable process, and the ability to produce a variety 
     of active enzymes during fermentation. As a result, PFHM has become a 
     research hotspot. This review focuses on the progress, challenges, 
     and opportunities in the research of PFHM. The use of probiotic 
     enzymes during fermentation alters the active ingredients of TCM, 
     resulting in positive pharmacological effects such as increased 
     active ingredients, reduced toxicity, new pharmacological effects, 
     and the reuse of herbal residues. PFHM has the potential to transfer 
     the metabolic transformation of the effective components of TCM by 
     intestinal flora outside the body during production and preparation, 
     which has a broad application prospect. However, due to the 
     complexity of the chemical composition of TCM, the mechanism of PFHM 
     requires further investigation. Finally, we discuss the prospects of 
     industrializing PFHM, which is essential for promoting the innovation 
     and modernization of TCM.]

     AB: Abstract. The brain metabolic changes caused by the interruption 
     of blood supply are the initial factors of brain injury in ischemic 
     stroke. Electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment has been shown to 
     protect against ischemic stroke, but whether its neuroprotective 
     mechanism involves metabolic regulation remains unclear. Based on our 
     finding that EA pretreatment significantly alleviated ischemic brain 
     injury in mice by reducing neuronal injury and death, we performed a 
     gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) to 
     investigate the metabolic changes in the ischemic brain and whether 
     EA pretreatment influenced these changes. First, we found that some 
     glycolytic metabolites in the normal brain tissues were reduced by EA 
     pretreatment, which may lay the foundation of neuroprotection for EA 
     pretreatment against ischemic stroke. Then, 6h of cerebral 
     ischemia-induced brain metabolic changes, especially the enhanced 
     glycolysis, were partially reversed by EA pretreatment, which was 
     manifested by the brain levels of 11 of 35 up-regulated metabolites 
     and 18 of 27 down-regulated metabolites caused by cerebral ischemia 
     significantly decreasing and increasing, respectively, due to EA 
     pretreatment. A further pathway analysis showed that these 11 and 18 
     markedly changed metabolites were mainly involved in starch and 
     sucrose metabolism, purine metabolism, aspartate metabolism, and the 
     citric acid cycle. Additionally, we found that EA pretreatment raised 
     the levels of neuroprotective metabolites in both normal and ischemic 
     brain tissues. In conclusion, our study revealed that EA pretreatment 
     may attenuate the ischemic brain injury by inhibiting glycolysis and 
     increasing the levels of some neuroprotective metabolites.]

     AB: Abstract. COVID-19 has posed unprecedented challenges to global 
     public health since its outbreak. The Qing-Fei-Pai-Du decoction 
     (QFPDD), a Chinese herbal formula, is widely used in China to treat 
     COVID-19. It exerts an impressive therapeutic effect by inhibiting 
     the progression from mild to critical disease in the clinic. However, 
     the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Both SARS-CoV-2 and 
     influenza viruses elicit similar pathological processes. Their severe 
     manifestations, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 
     multiple organ failure (MOF), and viral sepsis, are correlated with 
     the cytokine storm. During flu infection, QFPDD reduced the lung 
     indexes and downregulated the expressions of MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-6, and 
     IL-1β in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lungs, or serum 
     samples. The infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes 
     in lungs was decreased dramatically, and lung injury was ameliorated 
     in QFPDD-treated flu mice. In addition, QFPDD also inhibited the 
     polarization of M1 macrophages and downregulated the expressions of 
     IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-2, MCP-1, and IP-10, while also upregulating the 
     IL-10 expression. The phosphorylated TAK1, IKKα/β, and Iκ Bα and 
     the subsequent translocation of phosphorylated p65 into the nuclei 
     were decreased by QFPDD. These findings indicated that QFPDD reduces 
     the intensity of the cytokine storm by inhibiting the NF-κB 
     signaling pathway during severe viral infections, thereby providing 
     theoretical and experimental support for its clinical application in 
     respiratory viral infections]

     AB: Abstract. HIV mutations occur frequently despite the substantial 
     success of combination antiretroviral therapy, which significantly 
     impairs HIV progression. Failure to develop specific vaccines, the 
     occurrence of drug-resistant strains, and the high incidence of 
     adverse effects due to combination antiviral therapy regimens call 
     for novel and safer antivirals. Natural products are an important 
     source of new anti-infective agents. For instance, curcumin inhibits 
     HIV and inflammation in cell culture assays. Curcumin, the principal 
     constituent of the dried rhizomes of Curcuma longa L. (turmeric), is 
     known as a strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent with 
     different pharmacological effects. This work aims to assess 
     curcumin's inhibitory effects on HIV in vitro and to explore the 
     underpinning mechanism, focusing on CCR5 and the transcription factor 
     forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3). First, curcumin and the RT inhibitor 
     zidovudine (AZT) were evaluated for their inhibitory properties. 
     HIV-1 pseudovirus infectivity was determined by green fluorescence 
     and luciferase activity measurements in HEK293T cells. AZT was used 
     as a positive control that inhibited HIV-1 pseudoviruses 
     dose-dependently, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Then, a 
     molecular docking analysis was carried out to assess the binding 
     affinities of curcumin for CCR5 and HIV-1 RNase H/RT. The anti-HIV 
     activity assay showed that curcumin inhibited HIV-1 infection, and 
     the molecular docking analysis revealed equilibrium dissociation 
     constants of − 9.8kcal/mol and − 9.3kcal/mol between curcumin and 
     CCR5 and HIV-1 RNase H/RT, respectively. To examine curcumin's 
     anti-HIV effect and its mechanism in vitro, cell cytotoxicity, 
     transcriptome sequencing, and CCR5 and FOXP3 amounts were assessed at 
     different concentrations of curcumin. In addition, human CCR5 
     promoter deletion constructs and the FOXP3 expression plasmid 
     pRP-FOXP3 (with an EGFP tag) were generated. Whether FOXP3 DNA 
     binding to the CCR5 promoter was blunted by curcumin was examined 
     using transfection assays employing truncated CCR5 gene promoter 
     constructs, a luciferase reporter assay, and a chromatin 
     immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Furthermore, micromolar 
     concentrations of curcumin inactivated the nuclear transcription 
     factor FOXP3, which resulted in decreased expression of CCR5 in 
     Jurkat cells. Moreover, curcumin inhibited PI3K-AKT activation and 
     its downstream target FOXP3. These findings provide mechanistic 
     evidence encouraging further assessment of curcumin as a dietary 
     agent used to reduce the virulence of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. 
     Curcumin-mediated FOXP3 degradation was also reflected in its 
     functions, namely, CCR5 promoter transactivation and HIV-1 virion 
     production. Furthermore, curcumin inhibition of CCR5 and HIV-1 might 
     constitute a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing HIV 
     progression.]

     AB: Abstract. Cardiovascular diseases in post-menopausal women are on 
     a rise. Oxidative stress is the main contributing factor to the 
     etiology and pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Diosgenin, a 
     member of steroidal sapogenin, is structurally similar to estrogen 
     and has been shown to have antioxidant effects. Therefore, we aimed 
     to investigate the effects of diosgenin in preventing 
     oxidation-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and assessed its potential 
     as a substitute substance for estrogen in post-menopausal women. 
     Apoptotic pathways and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured 
     in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells and neonatal cardiomyocytes treated with 
     diosgenin for 1h prior to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stimulation. 
     H2O2-stimulated H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells displayed cytotoxicity and 
     apoptosis via the activation of both Fas-dependent and 
     mitochondria-dependent pathways. Additionally, it led to the 
     instability of the mitochondrial membrane potential. However, the 
     H2O2-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis was rescued by diosgenin through 
     IGF1 survival pathway activation. This led to the recovery of the 
     mitochondrial membrane potential by suppressing the Fas-dependent and 
     mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Diosgenin also inhibited 
     H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis through the estrogen receptor 
     interaction with PI3K/Akt and extracellular regulated protein kinases 
     1/2 activation in myocardial cells. In this study, we confirmed that 
     diosgenin attenuated H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis through 
     estrogen receptors-activated phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and ERK 
     signaling pathways in myocardial cells via estrogen receptor 
     interaction. All results suggest that H2O2-induced myocardial damage 
     is reduced by diosgenin due to its interaction with estrogen 
     receptors to decrease the damage. Herein, we conclude that diosgenin 
     might be a potential substitute substance for estrogen in 
     post-menopausal women to prevent heart diseases.]

     AB: Abstract. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease 
     characterized by CD4+ T cell-mediated immune cell infiltration and 
     demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). The subtypes of 
     CD4+ T cells are T helper cells 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, and regulatory T 
     cells (Treg), while three other types of cells besides Th2 play a key 
     role in MS and its classic animal model, experimental autoimmune 
     encephalomyelitis (EAE). Tregs are responsible for immunosuppression, 
     while pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells cause autoimmune-associated 
     demyelination. Therefore, suppressing Th1 and Th17 cell 
     differentiation and increasing the percentage of Treg cells may 
     contribute to the treatment of EAE/MS. Astragali Radix (AR) is a 
     representative medicine with immunoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, 
     antitumor, and neuroprotective effects.The active ingredients in AR 
     include astragalus flavones, polysaccharides, and saponins. In this 
     study, it was found that the total flavonoids of Astragus (TFA) could 
     effectively treat EAE in mice by ameliorating EAE motor disorders, 
     reducing inflammatory damage and demyelination, inhibiting the 
     proportion of Th17 and Th1 cells, and promoting Tregs differentiation 
     by regulating the JAK/STAT and NFκB signaling pathways. This novel 
     finding may increase the possibility of using AR or TFA as a drug 
     with immunomodulatory effects for the treatment of autoimmune 
     diseases.]

     AB: Abstract. Liver fibrosis is a disease largely driven by resident 
     and recruited macrophages. The phenotypic switch of hepatic 
     macrophages can be achieved by chemo-attractants and cytokines. 
     During a screening of plants traditionally used to treat liver 
     diseases in China, paeoniflorin was identified as a potential drug 
     that affects the polarization of macrophages. The aim of this study 
     was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of paeoniflorin in an animal 
     model of liver fibrosis and explore its underlying mechanisms. Liver 
     fibrosis was induced in Wistar rats via an intraperitoneal injection 
     of CCl4. In addition, the RAW264.7 macrophages were cultured in the 
     presence of CoCl2 to simulate a hypoxic microenvironment of fibrotic 
     livers in vitro. The modeled rats were treated daily with either 
     paeoniflorin (100, 150, and 200mg/kg) or YC-1 (2mg/kg) for 8 weeks. 
     Hepatic function, inflammation and fibrosis, activation of hepatic 
     stellate cells (HSC), and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition were 
     assessed in the in vivo and in vitro models. The expression levels of 
     M1 and M2 macrophage markers and the NF-κB/HIF-1α pathway factors 
     were measured using standard assays. Paeoniflorin significantly 
     alleviated hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, as well as hepatocyte 
     necrosis in the CCl4-induced fibrosis model. Furthermore, 
     paeoniflorin also inhibited HSC activation and reduced ECM deposition 
     both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, paeoniflorin restrained 
     M1 macrophage polarization and induced M2 polarization in the 
     fibrotic liver tissues as well as in the RAW264.7 cells grown under 
     hypoxic conditions by inactivating the NF-κB/HIF-1α signaling 
     pathway. In conclusion, paeoniflorin exerts its anti-inflammatory and 
     anti-fibrotic effects in the liver by coordinating macrophage 
     polarization through the NF-κB/HIF-1α pathway.]

     AB: Abstract. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most serious 
     complications of diabetes and the most common cause of death. The 
     autophagy of podocytes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of 
     DN. Here, through screening the constituent compounds of practical 
     and useful Chinese herbal formulas, we identified that isoorientin 
     (ISO) strongly promoted the autophagy of podocytes and could 
     effectively protect podocytes from high glucose (HG)-induced injury. 
     ISO significantly improved autophagic clearance of damaged 
     mitochondria under HG conditions. Through a proteomics-based 
     approach, we identified that ISO could reverse the excessive 
     phosphorylation of TSC2 S939 under HG conditions and stimulate 
     autophagy through inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-TSC2-mTOR pathway. 
     Furthermore, ISO was predicted to bind to the SH2 domain of 
     PI3Kp85β, which is crucial for the recruitment and activation of 
     PI3K. The protective effect of ISO and its effects on autophagy and 
     particularly on mitophagy were further proved using a DN mice model. 
     To summarize, our study identified the protective effects of ISO 
     against DN and demonstrated that ISO was a strong activator of 
     autophagy, which could provide a basis for drug development.]

     AB: Abstract. Solasonine (SS) is a natural glycoalkaloid compound 
     that has been reported to possess a significant anticancer function. 
     However, its anticancer effects and related mechanisms in 
     osteosarcoma (OS) have not been studied. This study sought to 
     investigate the impact of SS on the growth of OS cells. OS cells were 
     treated with different concentrations of SS for 24h, and the results 
     showed that SS attenuated the survival of OS cells in a 
     dose-dependent manner. Additionally, SS suppressed cancer stem-like 
     properties and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by inhibiting 
     aerobic glycolysis in OS cells in an ALDOA-dependent manner. 
     Additionally, SS reduced the levels of Wnt3a, β-catenin, and Snail 
     in OS cells in vitro. Furthermore, Wnt3a activation reversed the 
     SS-induced inhibition of glycolysis in OS cells. Collectively, this 
     study discovered a novel effect of SS in inhibiting aerobic 
     glycolysis, in addition to cancer stem-like features and EMT, 
     implying that SS could be a therapeutic candidate for OS treatment.]

     AB: Abstract. Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of 
     cancer-related death among men. Treatment of PC becomes difficult 
     after progression because PC that used to be androgen-dependent 
     becomes androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). Veratramine, an 
     alkaloid extracted from the root of the Veratrum genus, has recently 
     been reported to have anticancer effects that work against various 
     cancers; however, its anticancer effects and the underlying mechanism 
     of action in PC remain unknown. We investigated the anticancer 
     effects of veratramine on AIPC using PC3 and DU145 cell lines, as 
     well as a xenograft mouse model. The antitumor effects of veratramine 
     were evaluated using the CCK-8, anchorage-independent colony 
     formation, trans-well, wound healing assays, and flow cytometry in 
     AIPC cell lines. Microarray and proteomics analyses were performed to 
     investigate the differentially expressed genes and proteins induced 
     by veratramine in AIPC cells. A xenograft mouse model was used to 
     confirm the therapeutic response and in vivo efficacy of veratramine. 
     Veratramine dose dependently reduced the proliferation of cancer 
     cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, veratramine treatment 
     effectively suppressed the migration and invasion of PC cells. The 
     immunoblot analysis revealed that veratramine significantly 
     downregulated Cdk4/6 and cyclin D1 via the ATM/ATR and Akt pathways, 
     both of which induce a DNA damage response that eventually leads to 
     G1 phase arrest. In this study, we discovered that veratramine 
     exerted antitumor effects on AIPC cells. We demonstrated that 
     veratramine significantly inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells 
     via G0/G1 phase arrest induced by the ATM/ATR and Akt pathways. These 
     results suggest that veratramine is a promising natural therapeutic 
     agent for AIPC.]

     AB: Context: The influence of several psychological characteristics 
     on the willingness of athletes to report concussion behaviors has not 
     been well explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 
     understand how athletic identity and sport passion predicted 
     participants' willingness to report symptoms above what was explained 
     by athlete demographics, concussion knowledge, and perceived 
     seriousness of concussions. Design: The study was cross-sectional. 
     Methods: Three-hundred and twenty-two male and female high school and 
     club sport athletes completed survey measures of concussion 
     knowledge, athletic identity, harmonious and obsessive passion, and 
     degree to which athletes indicated they would report concussions and 
     concussion symptoms. Results: Athletes scored moderately high on 
     their knowledge of symptoms and other concussion information (mean = 
     16.21; ± = 2.88) and above the midpoint on their attitudes and 
     behaviors toward reporting concussion symptoms (mean = 3.64; ± = 
     0.70). There were no differences between gender, t(299) = −.78, P = 
     .44, and previous concussion education, t(296) = 1.93, P = .06, 
     related to concussion knowledge. Results of a hierarchical regression 
     indicated that after entering athlete demographics, concussion 
     knowledge, and perceived seriousness of concussions, of the 3 
     psychological variables in the final stage of the model, only 
     obsessive passion was a significant predictor of athlete's attitudes 
     to report a concussion. Conclusions: Perceived seriousness of 
     concussion, perceived threat to long-term health, and obsessive 
     passion were the strongest predictors of athlete's willingness to 
     report concussions. Athletes who did not believe concussions posed a 
     threat to their current or future health, and those that held an 
     obsessive passion for sport were most at risk for not reporting 
     concussions. Future research should continue to investigate the 
     relationship between reporting behaviors and psychological factors.]

     AB: Context: Long-lever shoulder strength tests may aid clinical 
     decision-making regarding return to sport after a shoulder injury. 
     The Athletic Shoulder Test (AST) was developed to measure force 
     production in 3 positions of shoulder abduction (90°, 135°, and 
     180°) using force plates. However, handheld dynamometers (HHDs) are 
     more portable, affordable, and may provide valid and reliable results 
     which would increase the clinical utility of long-lever tests. HHDs 
     vary in shape, design, and their capacity to report parameters such 
     as rate of force production and require further investigation. The 
     aim of this study was to examine the intrarater reliability of the 
     Kinvent HHD and assess its validity against Kinvent force plates in 
     the AST. Peak force (in kilograms), torque (in Newton meters), and 
     normalized torque (in Newton meters per kilogram) were reported. 
     Design: Validity and reliability study. Methods: Twenty-seven 
     participants with no history of upper limb injury performed the test 
     in a randomized order using the Kinvent HHD and force plates. Each 
     condition was assessed 3 times, and peak force was recorded. Arm 
     length was measured to calculate peak torque. Normalized peak torque 
     was calculated by dividing torque by bodyweight (in kilograms). 
     Results: The Kinvent HHD is reliable when measuring force (intraclass 
     correlation coefficient [ICC] ≥ .80), torque (ICC ≥ .84), and 
     normalized torque (ICC ≥ .64) during the AST. The Kinvent HHD is 
     also valid when compared with the Kinvent force plates for force (ICC 
     ≥ .79; r ≥ .82), torque (ICC ≥ .82; r ≥ .76), and normalized 
     torque (ICC ≥ .71; r ≥ .61). There were no statistically 
     significant differences across the 3 trials on analyses of variance 
     (P > .05). Conclusions: The Kinvent HHD is a reliable tool when used 
     to measure force, torque, and normalized torque in the AST. 
     Furthermore, given the lack of significant difference between trials, 
     clinicians can use one test to accurately report relative peak 
     force/torque/normalized torque rather than average 3 separate trials. 
     Finally, the Kinvent HHD is valid when compared with Kinvent force 
     plates.]

     AB: Context: Bridge exercises are extensively used in 
     trunk-strengthening programs. The aim of this study was to 
     investigate the effect of bridging duration on lateral abdominal 
     muscle thickness and gluteus maximus activation. Design: 
     Cross-sectional. Methods: Twenty-five young males participated in 
     this study. Transversus abdominal (TrA), external and internal 
     oblique ultrasound thickness, gluteus maximus electromyographic 
     activation, and sacral tilt angle were simultaneously measured for 
     every second during 30-second bridging exercise. The contraction 
     thickness ratio and root mean squared signal (normalized to maximum 
     isometric contraction signal) during 6 exercise durations (from 0 to 
     5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 s) were also calculated and compared using 
     analysis of variance designs. Results: TrA and internal oblique 
     contraction thickness ratio and gluteus maximus root mean squared 
     increased during the first 8 to 10 seconds and remained elevated 
     until the end of the 30-second exercise (P < .05). External oblique 
     contraction thickness ratio declined during exercise (P < .05). 
     Five-second bridging showed less TrA thickness and anteroposterior 
     and mediolateral sacral tilt angle and a lower anteroposterior tilt 
     variability compared with bridges, which lasted more than 10 seconds 
     (P < .05). Conclusions: Bridge exercises longer than 10 seconds may 
     be better for promoting TrA recruitment than bridges of shorter 
     duration. Clinicians and exercise specialists could adjust the 
     duration of bridge exercise based on the aims of the exercise 
     program.]

     AB: Context: Different resistance exercise determinants modulate the 
     musculotendinous adaptations following eccentric hamstring training. 
     The Nordic Hamstring Exercise (NHE) can be performed 2-fold: the 
     movement velocity irreversibly increases toward the end of the range 
     of motion or it is kept constant. Design: This cross-sectional study 
     aimed to investigate if the downward acceleration angle (DWAangle) 
     can be used as a classification parameter to distinguish between 
     increasing and constant velocity NHE execution. Furthermore, the 
     kinetic and kinematic differences of these 2 NHE execution conditions 
     were examined by analyzing the DWAangle in relation to the angle of 
     peak moment. Methods: A total of 613 unassisted NHE repetitions of 12 
     trained male sprinters (22 y, 181 cm, 76 kg) were analyzed. Results: 
     The majority of analyzed parameters demonstrated large effects. NHEs 
     with constant velocity (n = 285) revealed significantly higher 
     impulses (P < .001; d = 2.34; + 61%) and fractional time under 
     tension (P < .001; d = 1.29; +143%). Although the generated peak 
     moments were significantly higher for constant velocity (P = .003; d 
     = 0.29; +4%), they emerged at similar knee flexion angles (P = .167; 
     d = 0.28) and revealed on average just low relationships to the 
     DWAangle (R2mean=22.4%). DWAangle highly correlated with the impulse 
     (R2mean=60.8%) and δ (DWAangle-angle of peak moment; R2mean=83.6%). 
     Conclusions: Relating DWAangle to angle of peak moment assists to 
     distinguish between significantly different NHE execution, which will 
     potentially elicit different musculotendinous adaptations. These 
     insights are essential for coaches and athletes to understand how to 
     manipulate eccentric hamstring training to change its purpose.]

     AB: Context: Early physical activity (PA) after concussion may

     frequency/duration, yet precise PA intensity or volume required for 
     optimal recovery requires further investigation. moderate to vigorous 
     physical activity (MVPA) is beneficial for physical health. We 
     investigated whether sedentary time, light activity time, MVPA time, 
     or activity frequency in the weeks following concussion are 
     associated with time to symptom resolution among adolescents. Design: 
     Prospective cohort study. Methods: Adolescents 10-18 years of age 
     were tested ≤14 days of concussion and followed until symptom 
     resolution. At the initial visit, participants rated symptom severity 
     and were provided wrist-worn activity trackers to monitor PA for the 
     following week. PA behavior was categorized each day based on heart 
     rate: sedentary (resting), light PA (50%-69% age-predicted max heart 
     rate), and MVPA (70%-100% age-predicted max heart rate). Symptom 
     resolution was defined as the date when participants reported 
     cessation of concussion-like symptoms. Patients were not given 
     specific PA instructions, though some may have received instructions 
     from their physician. Results: Fifty-four participants were included 
     in the study (54% female; mean age = 15.0 [1.8] y; initially assessed 
     7.5 [3.2] d after concussion). Female athletes recorded more 
     sedentary time (900 [46] vs 738 [185] min/d; P = .01; Cohen d = 
     0.72), and less time in light PA (194.7 [64.5] vs 224 [55] min/d; P = 
     .08; Cohen d = 0.48) and MVPA (23 [17] vs 38 [31] min/d; P = .04; 
     Cohen d = 0.58) than male athletes. After adjusting for sedentary 
     time, hours per day with >250 steps, sex, and initial symptom 
     severity, more MVPA time was associated with faster symptom 
     resolution time (hazard ratio = 1.016; 95% confidence interval, 
     1.001-1.032; P = .04). Conclusion: Our findings offer preliminary 
     insight into how varying PA intensities affect concussion recovery, 
     as MVPA may be a higher intensity than what is typically prescribed 
     in concussion care.]

     (The Landing Error Scoring System) using a markerless motion capture 
     system and depth camera. Data on incidence of lower-extremity injury,

     total of 1905 participants (452 females, 23.7%) were examined for 
     knee valgus and BSI status. A total of 50 BSI occurred during the 
     study period (incidence proportion = 2.6%). The unadjusted odds ratio 
     for BSI at initial contact was 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
     0.94-1.14; P = .49). Adjusted for sex, the odds ratio for BSI at 
     initial contact was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87-1.06; P = .47). At the instant 
     of maximum knee-flexion angle, the unadjusted odds ratio was 1.06 
     (95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P = .01), and the odds ratio was 1.02 (95% CI, 
     0.98-1.07; P = .29) after adjusting for sex. This suggests that there 
     was not a significant enough association for an increase in the odds 
     of BSI based on either degree of knee valgus. Conclusions: Our 
     results did not demonstrate an association between knee valgus angle 
     data during a jump-landing task and future increased odds of BSI in a 
     military training population. Further analysis is warranted, but the 
     results suggests the association between kinematics and BSI cannot be 
     effectively screened by knee valgus angle data in isolation.]

     TI: Context: Current lower-extremity return to sport testing 
     primarily considers the physical status of an athlete; however, sport 
     participation requires continuous cognitive dual-task engagement. 
     Therefore, the purpose was to develop and evaluate the reliability of 
     a visual-cognitive reactive (VCR) triple hop test that simulates the 
     typical sport demand of combined online visual-cognitive processing 
     and neuromuscular control to improve return to sport testing after 
     lower-extremity injury. Design: Test-retest reliability. Methods: 
     Twenty-one healthy college students (11 females, 23.5 [3.7] y, 1.73 
     [0.12] m, 73.0 [16.8] kg, Tegner Activity Scale 5.5 [1.1] points) 
     participated. Participants performed a single-leg triple hop with and 
     without a VCR dual task. The VCR task incorporated the FitLight 
     system to challenge peripheral response inhibition and central 
     working memory. Maximum hop distance, reaction time, cognitive 
     errors, and physical errors were measured. Two identical testing 
     visits were separated by 12 to 17 days (14 [1] d). Results: 
     Traditional triple hop (intraclass correlation coefficients: ICC(3,1) 
     = .96 [.91-.99]; standard error of the measurement = 16.99 cm) and 
     the VCR triple hop (intraclass correlation coefficients(3,1) = .92 
     [.82-.97]; standard error of the measurement = 24.10 cm) both 
     demonstrated excellent reliability for the maximum hop distance, and 
     moderate reliability for the VCR triple hop reaction time (intraclass 
     correlation coefficients(3,1) = .62 [.09-.84]; standard error of the 
     measurement = 0.09 s). On average, the VCR triple hop resulted in a 
     hop distance deficit of 8.17% (36.4 [5.1] cm; P < .05, d = 0.55) 
     relative to the traditional triple hop. Conclusions: Hop distance on 
     the VCR triple hop had excellent test-retest reliability and induced 
     a significant physical performance deficit when compared with the 
     traditional triple hop assessment. The VCR triple hop reaction time 
     also demonstrated moderate reliability.]

     AB: Context: Hip muscle imbalance, especially between gluteal muscles 
     and tensor fasciae latae (TFL), is one of the risk factors for 
     developing low back pain which should be considered in rehabilitation 
     programs. This study compared the effect of exercises with

     semiexperimental intervention study with a pretest and posttest. 
     Methods: A total of 45 patients with nonspecific chronic low back 
     pain were randomly divided into 2 experimental groups of 
     gluteal-to-TFL muscle activation index above 50 (n = 15), below 50 (n 
     = 15), and a control group (n = 15). Pain intensity (visual analog 
     scale), disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire), and 
     lower limbs' ROM including hip extension, hip abduction, hip external 
     rotation, and knee extension (goniometer) were assessed at pretest 
     and after 8 weeks of intervention. Results: Within-group comparison 
     showed significant improvement of pain, disability, and ROMs in both 
     experimental groups. No significant changes were observed in the 
     control group. In between-group analysis, significant differences 
     were observed in group of gluteal-to-TFL muscle activation index 
     above 50 for only pain (P = .03) and disability (P = .01). For ROMs, 
     although clinical improvement of lower limbs' ROMs was higher in

     statistically and clinically superior effectiveness of exercises with 
     a gluteal-to-TFL muscle activation index above 50 in the reduction of 
     pain and disability. Based on the clinical significance of exercises 
     with a gluteal-to-TFL muscle activation index above 50 for improving 
     ROMs, utilizing specific exercises that more activated gluteal muscle 
     compared to TFL is recommended for patient with restricted lower 
     limbs' ROMs.]

     AB: Background: Low-intensity resistance exercise therapy (LIRET) 
     based on myofascial chains, applied to both affected and nonlocal 
     joints, is an effective method for knee osteoarthritis (OA) 
     rehabilitation. This study applied LIRET in a comparison of prevalues 
     and postvalues of lower-limb tension in female patients with knee OA 
     and asymptomatic participants. Methods: Twenty-four female 
     participants with knee OA and 20 asymptomatic women took part in a 
     3-month long application of LIRET. Participants' ankle passive torque 
     and ankle range of motion in the sagittal plane were assessed with an 
     isokinetic dynamometer. The collected values were used to estimate 
     the sagittal-plane lower-limb tension. Results: Compared with the 
     asymptomatic group, participants with knee OA presented decreased 
     maximum ankle dorsiflexion (P < .001), decreased ankle plantar 
     flexion range (P = .023), ankle resting position more inclined to 
     dorsiflexion (P = .017), increased ankle dorsiflexion stiffness (P = 
     .005), and lower ankle plantar flexion stiffness (P = .034). After 
     exercise intervention, the knee OA group self-reported less knee pain 
     (P < .001), improved physical function (P < .001), increased maximum 
     dorsiflexion (P = .021), and increased plantar flexion range (P < 
     .001). While plantar flexion stiffness increased (P = .037), 
     dorsiflexion stiffness decreased (P = .015) and ankle resting 
     position moved toward dorsiflexion (P = .002). Results suggest 
     possible decreased anterior leg tension and possible increased 
     posterior leg tension in patients with knee OA. Conclusions: The 
     results supported that knee OA patients present imbalanced myofascial 
     tension of lower limbs. LIRET based on myofascial chains appears to 
     decrease pain, and stiffness, and improve physical function of 
     patients with knee OA and change their lower-limb tension.]

     AB: Abstract. SARS-CoV-2 has posed a threat to the health of people 
     around the world because of its strong transmission and high 
     virulence. Currently, there is no specific medicine for the treatment 
     of COVID-19. However, for a wide variety of medicines used to treat 
     COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays a major role. In 
     this paper, the effective treatment of COVID-19 using TCM was 
     consulted first, and several Chinese medicines that were frequently 
     used apart from their huge role in treating it were found. Then, when 
     exploring the active ingredients of these herbs, it was discovered 
     that most of them contained flavonoids. Therefore, the structure and 
     function of the potential active substances of flavonoids, including 
     flavonols, flavonoids, and flavanes, respectively, are discussed in 
     this paper. According to the screening data, these flavonoids can 
     bind to the key proteins of SARS-CoV-2, 3CLpro, PLpro, and RdRp, 
     respectively, or block the interface between the viral spike protein 
     and ACE2 receptor, which could inhibit the proliferation of 
     coronavirus and prevent the virus from entering human cells. Besides, 
     the effects of flavonoids on the human body systems are expounded on 
     in this paper, including the respiratory system, digestive system, 
     and immune system, respectively. Normally, flavonoids boost the 
     body's immune system. However, they can suppress the immune system 
     when over immunized. Ultimately, this study hopes to provide a 
     reference for the clinical drug treatment of COVID-19 patients, and 
     more TCM can be put into the market accordingly, which is expected to 
     promote the development of TCM on the international stage.]

     AB: Abstract. Few studies have reported the therapeutic effects of 
     Korean red ginseng (KRG) against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
     coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the positive effects of KRG on 
     other viruses have been reported and the effects of KRG on pulmonary 
     inflammatory diseases have also been studied. Therefore, this study 
     investigated the therapeutic effects of KRG-water extract (KRG-WE) in 
     a pseudo-type SARS-CoV-2 (PSV)-induced lung injury model. 
     Constructing the pseudovirus, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
     (hACE2) transgenic mice were infected via intranasal injection that 
     had been orally administered with KRG-WE for six weeks. After 7-days 
     post infection (dpi), the antiviral effects of KRG-WE were confirmed, 
     followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blot 
     analysis, flow cytometric analysis, and an enzyme-linked immunoassay 
     (ELISA). KRG-WE significantly inhibited an increase in immunoglobulin 
     caused by PSV. Furthermore, KRG-WE effectively suppressed alveolar 
     macrophages (AMs) inside the lungs and helped normalize the 
     population of other immune cells. In addition, virus-induced gene 
     expression and inflammatory signals such as nuclear factor-kappa B 
     and other upstream molecules were downregulated. Moreover, KRG-WE 
     also normalized gene expression and protein activity in the spleen. 
     In conclusion, KRG-WE reduced AMs, normalized the immune response, 
     and decreased the expression of inflammatory genes and activation of 
     signaling pathway phosphorylation, thereby exhibiting 
     anti-inflammatory effects and attenuating lung damage.]

     AB: Abstract. Toxic Chinese materia medica (CMM) has both 
     pharmacological activities and toxic effects. Based on thousands of 
     years of experience in the application of CMMs, people have explored 
     many practical processing methods of CMMs, also known as "Pao Zhi", 
     to reduce/control toxicity and preserve/enhance efficacy. Toxic CMMs 
     have been used throughout China's hospitals. Yet, the production and 
     use of toxic CMM should be carried out in accordance with the Chinese 
     pharmacopoeia (ChP) and the processing regulations formulated by the 
     health administrative departments of provinces, autonomous regions, 
     and municipalities directly under the Central Government. This paper 
     summarizes the current understanding and awareness of toxicity and 45 
     toxic CMMs, the commonly used processing methods of toxic CMMs 
     recorded in the 2020 edition of ChP, and the changes in the chemical 
     component, toxicity, or efficacy profiles after processing. This 
     review may provide useful information for the processing methods of 
     toxic CMMs worldwide. We believe that with an in-depth study and 
     understanding of toxic CMMs combined with a standardized application, 
     the toxicity of CMMs will be predictable and controllable in the 
     future.]

     AB: Abstract. Hepatic fibrosis (HF) is a wound healing response 
     featuring excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and 
     activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) that occurs during 
     chronic liver injury. As an initial stage of various liver diseases, 
     HF is a reversible pathological process that, if left unchecked, can 
     escalate into cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. HF is a 
     life-threatening disease presenting morbidity and mortality 
     challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. There is no specific and 
     effective anti-HF therapy, and the toxic side effects of the 
     available drugs also impose a heavy financial burden on patients. 
     Therefore, it is significant to study the pathogenesis of HF and 
     explore effective prevention and treatment measures. Formerly called 
     adipocytes, or fat storage cells, HSCs regulate liver growth, 
     immunity, and inflammation, as well as energy and nutrient 
     homeostasis. HSCs in a quiescent state do not proliferate and store 
     abundant lipid droplets (LDs). Catabolism of LDs is characteristic of 
     the activation of HSCs and morphological transdifferentiation of 
     cells into contractile and proliferative myofibroblasts, resulting in 
     the deposition of ECM and the development of HF. Recent studies have 
     revealed that various Chinese medicines (e.g. Artemisia annua, 
     turmeric, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, etc.) are able to 
     effectively reduce the degradation of LDs in HSCs. Therefore, this 
     study takes the modification of LDs in HSCs as an entry point to 
     elaborate on the process of Chinese medicine intervening in the loss 
     of LDs in HSCs and the mechanism of action for the treatment of HF.]

     AB: Abstract. Chicoric acid (CA), a functional food ingredient, is a 
     caffeic acid derivative that is mainly found in lettuce, pulsatilla, 
     and other natural plants. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of 
     CA in acute lung injury (ALI) remain poorly understood. This study 
     was conducted to investigate potential drug usage of CA for ALI and 
     the underlying molecular mechanisms of inflammation. C57BL/6 mice 
     were given injections of liposaccharide (LPS) to establish the in 
     vivo model. Meanwhile, BMDM cells were stimulated with LPS+ATP to 
     build the in vitro model. CA significantly alleviated inflammation 
     and oxidative stress in both the in vivo and in vitro models of ALI 
     through the inhibition of NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 
     (NLRP3)-mediated pyroptosis. In addition, CA attenuated mitochondrial 
     damage to suppress NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in the in vivo and in 
     vitro models of ALI by suppressing the production of reactive oxygen 
     species (ROS) via inhibiting the Akt/nuclear factor erythroid 
     2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. CA inhibited the interaction 
     between Akt at T308 and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK1) 
     at S549, thus promoting the phosphorylation of the Akt protein. 
     Furthermore, CA directly targeted the PDPK1 protein and accelerated 
     PDPK1 ubiquitination, indicating that 91-GLY, 111-LYS, 126-TYR, 
     162-ALA, 205-ASP, and 223-ASP might be responsible for the 
     interaction between PDPK1 and CA. In conclusion, CA from Lettuce 
     alleviated NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in the ALI model through 
     ROS-induced mitochondrial damage by activating Akt/Nrf2 pathway via 
     PDPK1 ubiquitination. The present study suggests that CA might be a 
     potential therapeutic drug to treat or prevent ALI in pneumonia or 
     COVID-19.]

     AB: Abstract. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, commonly known 
     as the formation of fibrofatty lesions in the artery wall, are the 
     leading causes of death globally. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein 
     (oxLDL) is one of the major components of atherosclerotic plaques. It 
     is evident that dietary supplementation containing sources of 
     antioxidants can prevent atherogenic diseases. Schisanhenol (SAL), a 
     dibenzocyclooctene lignin, has been shown to attenuate oxLDL-induced 
     apoptosis and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 
     endothelial cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are 
     still largely unknown. In this study, human umbilical vein 
     endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pre-treated with SAL and oxLDL. Our 
     results showed that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase 
     (AMPK) phosphorylation was enhanced in cells pre-treated with SAL in 
     time-dependent and dose-dependent manners. Subsequently, 
     oxLDL-induced AMPK dephosphorylation and protein kinase C (PKC) 
     phosphorylation were significantly reversed in the presence of SAL. 
     In addition, SAL treatment led to an inhibiting effect on the 
     oxLDL-induced membrane assembly of NADPH oxidase subunits, and a 
     similar effect was observed in ROS generation. This effect was 
     further confirmed using knockdown AMPK with small interfering RNA 
     (siRNA) and pharmaceutical reagents, such as the AMPK activator 
     (AICAR), PKC inhibitor (Gö 6983), and ROS inhibitor (DPI). 
     Furthermore, the oxLDL-induced intracellular calcium rise and the 
     potential collapse of the mitochondrial membrane reduced the 
     Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and released cytochrome c from the mitochondria, 
     leading to the subsequent activation of caspase-3 in HUVECs, which 
     were also markedly suppressed by SAL pretreatment. The results 
     mentioned above may provide additional insights into the possible 
     molecular mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular protective effects 
     of SAL.]

     that has been used to treat different inflammatory diseases. The 
     purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of 
     Rosa roxburghii Tratt extract (RRTE) against ulcerative colitis (UC) 
     using network pharmacology and experimental validation. 
     HPLC-Q/Orbitrap MS was used to rapidly identify the substances 
     contained in RRTE after extracting the active components from the 
     fruit. Then, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking was 
     used to explore the critical target and potential mechanism of RRTE 
     against UC using the active ingredients in RRTE as the research 
     object. Data are presented in a visual manner. Finally, the 
     pharmacological effects of RRTE in alleviating UC were further 
     verified using a DSS-induced UC model of NCM460. The results showed 
     that 25 components in RRTE were identified. A total of 250 targets of 
     the active components and 5376 targets associated with UC were 
     collected. Furthermore, a systematic analysis of the Protein-Protein 
     Interaction (PPI) networks suggests that epidermal growth factor 
     receptor (EGFR), phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 
     (PIK3R1), and serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) are critical targets 
     for RRTE in the treatment of UC. A comprehensive regulatory network 
     analysis showed that RRTE alleviated UC through the EGFR-mediated 
     PI3K/Akt pathway, and molecular docking showed that active components 
     could strongly bind to EGFR, PIK3R1, and AKT1. In addition, RRTE 
     alleviated dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced cell injury and 
     significantly decreased the protein expression levels of EGFR, 
     PIK3R1, and p-AKT in NCM460 cells in vitro. Furthermore, RRTE 
     significantly regulated the expression of the apoptosis-related 
     proteins Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf1), cleaved 
     caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2), and Bcl2 associated X protein 
     (Bax). In conclusion, the components of RRTE are complex, and RRTE 
     can relieve UC through the EGFR-mediated PI3K/Akt pathway]

     AB: Abstract. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic 
     inflammatory disorders that include Crohn's disease (CD) and 
     ulcerative colitis (UC). Today, IBD has no successful treatment. As a 
     result, it is of paramount importance to develop novel therapeutic 
     agents for IBD prevention and treatment. Astragalus membranaceus 
     (AMS) is a traditional Chinese medicine found in the AMS root. Modern 
     pharmacological studies indicate that AMS and its constituents 
     exhibit multiple bioactivities, such as anti-inflammatory, 
     anti-oxidant, immune regulatory, anticancer, hypolipidemic, 
     hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, expectorant, and diuretic effects. 
     AMS and its active constituents, which have been reported to be 
     effective in IBD treatment, are believed to be viable candidate drugs 
     for IBD treatment. These underlying mechanisms are associated with 
     anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, immunomodulation, intestinal 
     epithelial repair, gut microbiota homeostasis, and improved energy 
     metabolism. In this review, we summarize the efficacy and underlying 
     mechanisms involved in IBD treatment with AMS and its active 
     constituents in preclinical studies.]

     AB: Abstract. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a recurrent disease 
     associated with a potential risk of colorectal cancer. Abelmoschus 
     manihot (AM), a Chinese herbal medicine, is known to alleviate IBD. 
     However, its mechanism of action requires further clarification. 
     Here, we focused on the role of IL-10 and the gut microbiota in the 
     mechanism of action of AM. The effects of AM on intestinal 
     inflammation, mucus production, and gut microbes were evaluated in 
     dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced acute and chronic IBD models and 
     in IL-10-deficient mice (IL-10−∕−). AM exhibited protective 
     effects on acute and chronic models of IBD in wild-type mice by 
     restoring body weight and colon length, promoting IL-10 secretion, 
     and decreasing TNF-α levels. Moreover, AM alleviated inflammatory 
     infiltration, increased mucin 2 transcription, and increased the 
     number of goblet cells in the colon. On the contrary, these effects 
     were diminished in IL-10−∕− mice, which implied that the effect 
     of AM on intestinal inflammation is IL-10-dependent. A gut microbial 
     sequencing analysis showed that gut microbial dysbiosis was modulated 
     by AM intervention. The regulatory effects of AM on Eggerthellaceae, 
     Sutterellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Burkholderiaceae, 
     Desulfovibrionaceae, and Enterococcaceae were dependent on IL-10. 
     These results revealed that AM ameliorated IBD and modulated gut 
     microbes by promoting IL-10 secretion, indicating that AM has the 
     potential to improve IBD and that AM is IL-10-dependent.]

     AB: Abstract. Rhizoma coptidis (CR) is traditionally used for 
     treating gastrointestinal diseases. Wine-processed CR (wCR), 
     zingiber-processed CR (zCR), and evodia-processed CR (eCR) are its 
     major processed products. However, the related study of their 
     specific mechanisms is very limited, and they need to be further 
     clarified. The aim of this study is to compare the intervening 
     mechanism of wCR/zCR/eCR on rats via faecal metabolomics and 16S rDNA 
     gene sequencing analysis. First, faecal samples were collected from 
     the control and CR/wCR/zCR/eCR groups. Then, a metabolomics analysis 
     was performed using UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS to obtain the metabolic profile 
     and significantly altered metabolites. The 16S rDNA gene sequencing 
     analysis was carried out to analyze the composition of gut microbiota 
     and screen out the significantly altered microbiota at the genus 
     level. Finally, a pathway enrichment analysis of the significantly 
     altered metabolites via the KEGG database and a functional prediction 
     of relevant gut microbes based on PICRUSt2 software were performed in 
     combination. Together with the correlation analysis between 
     metabolites and gut microbiota, the potential intervening mechanism 
     of wCR/zCR/eCR was explored. The results suggested that wCR played a 
     good role in maintaining immune homeostasis, promoting glycolysis, 
     and reducing cholesterol; zCR had a better effect on protecting the 
     integrity of the intestinal mucus barrier, preventing gastric ulcers, 
     and reducing body cholesterol; eCR was good at protecting the 
     integrity of the intestinal mucus barrier and promoting glycolysis. 
     This study scientifically elucidated the intervening mechanism of 
     wCR/zCR/eCR from the perspective of faecal metabolites and gut 
     microbiota, providing a new insight into the processing mechanism 
     research of Chinese herbs.]

     AB: Abstract. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of 
     cancer-related death in the United States, and chronic gut 
     inflammation is a risk factor for CRC initiation and development. 
     Curcuma longa L. or turmeric, has become one of the most studied 
     herbal medicines in recent years due to its anticancer potentials. It 
     is generally accepted that the major component in turmeric is 
     curcuminoids, and the active constituent in curcuminoids is curcumin. 
     However, unprocessed curcumin is characterized by poor water 
     solubility, which means low bioavailability in humans. To increase 
     the bioavailability of curcumin, in this study, we utilized a novel 
     surfactant-formulated curcumin (CuminUP60®) and evaluated its CRC 
     chemopreventive activities. Compared with the chemo-sensitive CRC 
     cell line HCT-116, the management of the CRC SW-480 cell line is a 
     challenge, since the latter is chemo-resistant. In other words, these 
     cancer cells resist the effects of the chemotherapy. Using the newly 
     formulated CuminUP60® water solution, this study demonstrated its 
     strong antiproliferative effects on the SW-480 cells in a dose- and 
     time-dependent manner. This new formulation induced early apoptosis 
     and arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase via the upregulation of 
     cyclin B1. We also observed that this new formulation possessed 
     inhibitory effects on Th17 cell differentiation, which regulates the 
     body's immune response against gut malignancies. In summary, our 
     results exhibited a potential clinical utility of the 
     surfactant-formulated curcumin in chemo-resistant colorectal cancer 
     management.]

     AB: Abstract. Cinobufagin, a cardiotonic steroid derived from toad 
     venom extracts, exhibits significant anticancer properties by 
     inhibiting Na++/K++-ATPase in cancer cells. It is frequently used in 
     clinical settings to treat advanced-stage cancer patients, improving 
     their quality of life and survival time. However, its long-term use 
     can result in multidrug resistance to other chemotherapy drugs, and 
     the exact mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown. 
     Therefore, this study explores the molecular mechanism underlying the 
     anticancer effects of cinobufagin in hepatocellular carcinomas 
     (HCCs), specifically in HepG2 and Huh-7 cells. As determined using 
     transcriptome analysis, cinobufagin-triggered protective autophagy 
     suppressed cell apoptosis in liver cancer HepG2 and Huh-7 cells by 
     inhibiting the phosphoinositide-3-Kinase (PI3K)-AKT serine/threonine 
     kinase (AKT)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. 
     Cinobufagin-inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and 
     generated cell autophagy by upregulating the expression of MAP1 light 
     chain 3 protein II, Beclin1, and autophagy-related protein 12-5. In 
     addition, the autophagy inhibitor MRT68921 improved the 
     antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of cinobufagin in the 
     studied cell lines. Overall, this study suggests that combining 
     cinobufagin with an autophagy inhibitor can effectively treat HCC, 
     providing a potential strategy for cancer therapy.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction: Parenting is a valued and complex role 
     that is shaped by culture and context, which can be significantly 
     impacted by a cancer diagnosis. This scoping review explored the 
     unmet supportive care needs and impact on daily life for parents 
     living with and beyond cancer. Methods: We used the PRISMA extension 
     for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) reporting guidelines to conduct a 
     scoping review of the literature. Peer-reviewed literature published 
     between January 2006 and December 2021 was searched using five 
     databases: CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. 
     Results: A total of 47 articles were included in the review 
     representing 14 countries. Unmet supportive care needs persist across 
     physical, spiritual, psychological, social, informational, practical, 
     emotional domains, regardless of cancer diagnosis, stage of cancer or 
     phase of the cancer care continuum. These unmet needs significantly 
     impacted the daily lives of mothers and fathers living with and 
     beyond cancer throughout studies. Conclusion: The results from this 
     review highlight the range of reported supportive care needs of 
     parents and its impact potentially contributing to occupational 
     disruption. This provides a unique opportunity for occupational 
     therapy practitioners to contribute to the occupational needs of 
     parents living with and beyond cancer as an integral member of the 
     interprofessional cancer care team.]

     whether an Instrumental Activities of Daily Living intervention 
     relieves psychological distress during hospital stays after digestive 
     cancer surgery. Methods:. In all, 24 patients were divided into two 
     groups according to the experience of cooking programme during 
     hospital stay ('control group', n = 11 and 'cooking group', n = 13) 
     and both groups received usual postoperative care. The two groups 
     were matched using propensity scores to reduce the potential for 
     confounding factors. Outcome measures included psychological distress 
     assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Basic 
     Activities of Daily Living assessed by the Functional Independence 
     Measure. Assessment time points were after surgical treatment and 
     before discharge. Results:. Propensity score matching generated nine 
     pairs ('control group', n = 9 and 'cooking group', n = 9). The 
     Functional Independence Measure improved in both groups (p = 0.008, r 
     = 0.89) and the improvements in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
     Scale were only found in the cooking group (p ≤ 0.049, r ≥ 0.66). 
     Conclusion:. We found significant improvement in Basic Activities of 
     Daily Livings in both groups and additional improvements in 
     psychological distress in the cooking group. These observations 
     suggest that Instrumental Activities of Daily Living-based 
     intervention could improve mental health in patients with cancer in 
     their early postoperative period.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction: Distance methods of supervision rapidly 
     increased in use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
     pandemic, and it is important to consider if these methods meet the 
     needs of supervisees when deciding whether to retain these practices 
     moving forward. Methods: An interpretative phenomenological approach 
     was used to gain insight into the lived experience of distance 
     supervision. Semi-structured interviews were completed with six 
     occupational therapists who had experience receiving distance 
     supervision as a supervisee, all of whom work in inpatient mental 
     health units within a private healthcare company. Results:. 
     Interpretative phenomenological analysis revealed four superordinate 
     themes of an altered interaction; the importance of a protected 
     space; factors within the supervisory relationship and maximising the 
     best of both worlds. Conclusion: Distance supervision methods afford 
     increased access for supervisees and a reduction in the practical 
     demands when supervised by an off-site supervisor. There are, 
     however, clear differences in the nature of the experience which need 
     to be considered to ensure that supervisee needs are met. This study 
     provides insight into how distance supervision methods impact on the 
     experience for supervisees and suggests areas for further 
     consideration in moving forward with such approaches.]

     devices that can encourage deep reflection and offer new insight. 
     Metaphors have been used within the both the occupational therapy and

     phenomenological study was to identify, analyze, and interpret 
     metaphors used by pediatric occupational therapists to describe 
     mindfulness in their clinical practices with children and youth. 
     Method: Eight North American Occupational Therapists participated in 
     semi-structured interviews which were transcribed verbatim. 
     Transcripts were read to identify idiographic or naturally occurring 
     metaphors used by participants. Metaphors of mindfulness were also 
     elicited from participants as an interview question. Findings: Three 
     themes were identified within participants' idiographic metaphors of 
     mindfulness: mindfulness as a tool, mindfulness as exploration, and 
     mindfulness as a support. Two additional themes were identified 
     within participants' idiographic metaphors of themselves as 
     facilitators of mindfulness: therapist as a guide, and therapist as a 
     gardener. Elicited metaphors generally aligned with the themes 
     identified for idiographic metaphors while some offered additional 
     unique insights. Conclusion: The findings open conversations about 
     therapists' framing of the use of mindfulness within the context of 
     pediatric occupational therapy.]

     experienced by women of reproductive age and encompasses somatic, 
     psychological and behavioural symptoms that recur during the luteal 
     stage of menstrual cycle and resolves during or after menstruation. 
     Although premenstrual syndrome has gained growing interest in recent 
     years, the experience of women living with premenstrual syndrome has 
     not yet been explored from an occupational perspective. Method: This 
     qualitative study an used exploratory and descriptive design to gain 
     a deeper understanding of the lived experience of women with 
     premenstrual syndrome through an occupational lens. Data were 
     collected using semi-structured interviews with four women living 
     with premenstrual syndrome symptoms. Each interview was transcribed 
     verbatim and thematically analysed. Findings: Three themes were 
     identified: (1) occupational disturbance, (2) social impairment and 
     occupational disengagement, and (3) the importance of self-awareness 
     to engage in occupations. Women with premenstrual syndrome symptoms 
     experienced difficulties that impacted their ability to engage in 
     occupations including self-care, productivity and leisure, 
     interfering with their occupational routine and interpersonal 
     relationships. A level of awareness was considered important to 
     manage premenstrual syndrome symptoms. Conclusion: The findings of 
     this study are relevant to understanding the impact of premenstrual 
     symptoms on daily living and for tailoring future interventions to 
     address the occupational needs in women with premenstrual syndrome.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction: There is a lack of explicit tool 
     recommendations for upper limb (UL) assessment in stroke, 
     occupational therapists are frequently underrepresented in consensus 
     studies, and the frequency of use of tools is highly variable between 
     countries. The objective was to generate national occupational 
     therapy consensus recommendations on UL assessment tools in stroke, 
     and to classify the tools that achieve consensus according to the 
     International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health 
     (ICF) components. Methods: Three-round e-Delphi study of national 
     scope. Occupational therapists working in Spain with training and 
     experience in neurorehabilitation were recruited. Rounds were based 
     on the completion of questionnaires on UL stroke assessment tools. 
     Consensus was reached when ≥75% of experts gave a ≥7 rating on a 
     nine-point Likert scale. Results: A total of 29 occupational 
     therapists comprised the expert panel. Twenty-three (17.8%) 
     assessment tools achieved consensus and were classified according to 
     the ICF components of body functions and structures (7), activities 
     (11), participation (3) and other (2). Conclusion: The expert panel 
     recommended 23 outcome measures for UL recovery in stroke, 
     representing all ICF components. The consensus recommendations are 
     intended to assist occupational therapists in their clinical 
     decision-making process, and to reduce the heterogeneity of research 
     tools.]

     pharmacy professional program. Health administration, nutrition and 
     dietet- ics, nursing, respiratory therapy, and clinical lab science 
     programs were also represented. METHODS: Participants were randomly 
     assigned to IPE teams of 6-7 individuals. The 1-day activity 
     transpired at a high-fidelity simulation facility and included a 
     pre-briefing, simulated scenario with high-fidelity mannequins, and a 
     faculty-guided video-assisted debriefing session. The patient 
     scenario was designed by subject area faculty experts and featured an 
     adult patient on hemodialysis. Participants completed pre and 
     post-activity questionnaires that included the Student Perceptions of 
     Interprofessional Clinical Education-Revised (SPICE-R) instrument. 
     RESULTS: Participants completed pre (n=107) and post-activity (n=81) 
     questionnaires. There was a significant increase from the pre-event 
     (M=3.90, SD 0.91) and post-event score (M=4.22, SD 0.84) for the 
     SPICE-R item regarding understanding "the roles of other 
     professionals within the interdisciplinary team"; t(186)= -2.471, 
     p=0.01. The SPICE-R item score for "health professionals should

     positively change students' perceptions of IPE. Future studies should 
     consider the impact of IPE on perceptions of diversity.]

     informative, and 3) collaboration. Themes related to patients as a 
     team member included: 1) active listening, 2) patients of 
     similar/dissimilar back- grounds, 3) person-centered care, and 4) 
     awareness. Themes derived from prompt about future collaborations 
     included: 1) collaboration, 2) awareness, and 3) person-centered 
     care. CONCLUSIONS: This SDH-focused experiential IPE advanced the 
     understanding among early learners of how social factors that 
     patients experience are barriers to how care is delivered and 
     interprofessional teams must collaborate to consider factors to 
     support patients.]

     AB: AIMS: Engaged and trained faculty to support and role- model 
     interprofessional education (IPE)-related concepts and behaviors are 
     vital in the development, implementation, and sustainability of IPE 
     academic teaching and train- ing programs. Thus, recruitment of 
     engaged faculty is essential for effective IPE expansion, scalability 
     innovation, and sustainability across a variety of schools, programs, 
     and students. The primary aim of this descriptive study was to 
     implement a strategy to recruit and engage new IPE faculty and 
     determine the strategy's effectiveness in increasing faculty's intent 
     to participate in future IPE. A secondary aim was to identify 
     implementation recommendations for this strategy as a first step of 
     IPE faculty engagement. METHODS: An introductory experiential 
     recruitment and engagement strategy for new Faculty Observers was 
     developed. The project used a descriptive study design and data were 
     gathered through pre- and post-program online self-administered 
     surveys completed by Faculty Observer participants. The surveys 
     included questions about demographics, rating usefulness of 
     activities, engagement motivators, and willingness to facilitate in 
     the future. RESULTS: Fifteen faculty with no or limited IPE 
     experience participated. Post-survey results indicated that 85% of 
     the participants expressed willingness to participate in this program 
     in the future, and 100% would recommend using this experiential 
     recruitment and engagement strategy. DISCUSSION: A "dip your toes in 
     the water" experiential strategy for IPE faculty recruitment and 
     engagement was effective in recruitment of new IPE faculty.]

     AB: INTRODUCTION: Several universities modified interprofes- sional 
     education (IPE) to a virtual format, showing similar outcomes as IPE 
     delivered through an in-person format. This study aimed to describe 
     perceptions of 106 students from programs in occupational therapy, 
     dietetics, nursing, athletic training, and speech-language pathology 
     (SLP) following an established IPE activity in a virtual format. This 
     information will add to previous literature through inclusion of 5 
     healthcare programs as well as identifying attitudes from each 
     discipline. both of which will enhance future IPE curriculum 
     development. METHODS: Following the IPE event with a case study, 
     participants wrote reflective essays describing their perceptions of 
     the virtual IPE experience. Four researchers analyzed the reflective 
     essays using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Findings revealed four 
     themes: beneficial learning experience, roles, the more the merrier, 
     and logistics. Participants felt overall that the vir- tual IPE 
     experience was beneficial, but the logistical issues of the online 
     format as well as students' amount of participation created negative 
     perceptions. Participants from dietetics expressed the most positive 
     comments (70%), followed by occupational therapy (69%), athletic 
     training (67%), speech-language pathology (54%) and nursing (48%). 
     Undergraduate students (dietetics and nursing) made 4% more positive 
     comments than graduate students (SLP, athletic training, occupational 
     therapy). DISCUSSION: Participants shared that the virtual IPE 
     experience is beneficial for optimal holistic care and felt some 
     components of the IPE experience prepared them for real-world 
     clinical practice. However, logistical issues (large group size and 
     online format) prevented equal participation and establishing a 
     connection with other participants.]

     AB: OBJECTIVES: Knowledge associated with the construct of leadership 
     and the sociodemographic profiles of those in leadership positions 
     within academic communication sciences and disorders (COSD) programs 
     in the United States is limited. The purpose of this study was to 
     investigate the sociodemographic profiles of people holding 
     department chair and/or program director positions in accredited 
     graduate speech-language pathology (SLP) and audiology (AUD) 
     programs. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational investigation 
     using public information was conducted to profile individuals in 
     leadership positions of academic programs. Tabulated data included 
     program variables (SLP, AUD, or SLP+AUD), degree offered, program 
     level, and national ranking, in addition to sociodemographic 
     variables of the individuals holding a leadership position. A 
     multidimensional statistical analysis was employed to address three 
     research questions examining: (a) the sociodemographic 
     characteristics of people in COSD leadership positions, (b) gender 
     distribution within leadership positions, and (c) national ranking of 
     institutions from which leaders obtained their terminal degree. 
     RESULTS: Data were acquired from 502 people holding a department 
     chair or program director positions at 305 universities, representing 
     98% of all accredited graduate programs. Over 80% of leaders held a 
     research doctorate (PhD) in COSD, and a large majority of all 
     leadership positions were in standalone academic departments. A 
     greater proportion of males held leadership positions when compared 
     to the distribution of male members of the American 
     Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), but the proportion of 
     male academic leaders was equivalent to their representation among 
     all male COSD faculty (20%). A larger proportion of academic COSD 
     leaders tended to have earned their terminal degree from a highly 
     ranked academic program. CONCLUSIONS: This study illuminates the 
     current profiles of those in leadership positions of academic 
     graduate programs in COSD. Given the critical shortage of qualified 
     faculty to staff accredited COSD programs, findings from this study 
     may inform potential solutions to the problem of faculty sufficiency 
     to assume leadership roles.]

     approach with feedback in various forms. The purpose of this study 
     was to examine the effect of novice peer versus experienced faculty 
     feedback utilizing video recordings on improving body mechanics 
     during a sit-to-stand transfer. METHODS: Twenty participants were 
     randomly assigned into groups receiving novice peer or experienced 
     faculty feedback utilizing video recordings. Surface electromyography 
     (sEMG) measurements of bilateral gluteus maximus (GM) and erector 
     spinae (ES) activation were collected during a sit-to-stand transfer 
     pre- and post-feed-back intervention. RESULTS: sEMG activity for all 
     participants pre- and post-intervention resulted in a statistically 
     significant decrease of bilateral ES and left GM activation. 
     Statistically significant decreases of left ES and left GM activation 
     were found in the faculty member group, while statistically 
     significant decrease of left ES activation was found in the peer 
     group. No statistically significant between-group differences were 
     found in post-intervention activation levels. CONCLUSION: The results 
     indicate that feedback utilizing video recordings can improve body 
     mechanics regardless of experience level of the person providing the 
     feedback. Using feedback from video recordings can have positive 
     effects on psychomotor skill acquisition.]

     AB: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and 
     Prevention established infection prevention recommendations, 
     resulting in hospital systems adopting universal mask-wearing. 
     Mask-wearing and its impact on patient-provider communication have 
     been highlighted, yet have not been systematically studied to date. 
     The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of mask-wearing on 
     provider communication during wheelchair education. Allied health 
     professionals (65 physical and occupational therapists and 1 other) 
     completed a 24-item, online self-report survey on the impact of 
     provider maskwearing on communication with patients and/or their 
     caregivers during wheelchair education. This survey contained 
     questions, graded on 5-point Likert-like scales, regarding the 
     perceived impact of mask-wearing on the quality of communication 
     efficiency and effectiveness, the types and frequency of 
     communication strategies used to enhance communication during 
     breakdowns, knowledge/confidence in implementing communication 
     strategies, and preferences for additional training. Results 
     indicated that maskwearing impacted communication, yet clinicians 
     made adaptations of various verbal and nonverbal communication 
     strategies to avoid disruptions in providing education.]

     AB: PURPOSE: To describe the product evaluation of a curriculum of 
     integrated clinical education (ICE) implemented into a Doctor of 
     Physical Therapy program. METHODS: A novel curriculum incorporating 
     five stand-alone ICE courses was developed and evaluated using the 
     Context, Input, Product, Process program assessment model. Primary 
     outcomes for product evaluation included Clinical Performance 
     Instrument (web-CPI) ratings of student performance, student 
     self-assessment aptitude, student satisfaction, and clinical 
     remediation counts during full-time clinical education experiences 
     (FTCEs). RESULTS: Outcomes from the first ICE curriculum cohort 
     (n=58) were compared to the prior two traditional curriculum cohorts 
     (n=76). There were no differences in clinical instructors' (CI) final 
     web-CPI assessments during terminal FTCEs. However, ICE students 
     scored higher on initial and intermediate FTCEs and were more 
     satisfied with the clinical education program. Student and CI final 
     web-CPI ratings indicated ICE group's ratings aligned more closely 
     with CI ratings. Remediation was simi- lar between the two curricula, 
     and the majority of CIs felt ICE students were at least as well 
     prepared for FTCEs as students in the traditional curriculum. 
     CONCLUSION: The outcomes of our product evaluation suggest that 
     educational strategies such as ICE may be capable of maximizing 
     student potential and reducing clinic and program resources during 
     clinical education.]

     There are limited publications on the admissions process in orthotics 
     and prosthetics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact 
     of the admissions interview weighting on the diversity of the 
     top-ranked applicants at one education program. METHODS: Researchers 
     gathered retrospective data from 3 years of admissions interviews 
     (n=144). The proportions of the screening scores and interview scores 
     were systematically adjusted to determine various ranking scores. At 
     each adjustment point, descriptive statistics of racial demographics, 
     age, gender, and military status of the top-ranking applicants were 
     evaluated. RESULTS: Adjustments in the weights of the screening and 
     interview scores had an impact on cohort diversity within, but not 
     across, admissions cycles. Increasing the weight of the interview 
     score decreased the mean age of a cohort for all admissions cycles. 
     CONCLUSION: This study is the first to present an evaluation of the 
     admissions process in an orthotics and prosthetics education program. 
     The methodology can be used by health professions education programs 
     which incorporate interview scoring into admissions decisions.]

     AB: AIMS:Previous research during novel disease outbreaks shows 
     mental health amongst frontline healthcare workers to be of concern. 
     Currently, there are limited data regarding mental health of 
     rehabilitation professionals working through the COVID-19 pandemic in 
     the acute care setting. This research examines the impact on mental 
     health amongst rehabilitation professionals working in the acute care 
     setting during the COVID-19 pandemic to better understand what 
     administrative policies can be imple- mented to support workers. 
     METHODS: The study administered a 22-question online survey to 221 
     occupational therapists, physical therapists, and speech-language 
     pathologists working in acute care/hospital settings. Data collection 
     occurred over 30 days in late 2021. Data were analyzed using 
     chi-squared analysis and t-test of means to identify significant 
     differences between demographic variables and reported emotional 
     health outcomes. RESULTS: Those of higher age reported higher 
     frequencies of depression and anxiety symptoms and fatigue (p >0.05). 
     Professionals with higher COVID-19 contact hours had higher emotional 
     distress and suicidal thoughts (p >0.05). Compared to certified 
     occupational therapy assistants and physical therapy assistants, 
     evaluating therapists had significantly higher reports of lifestyle 
     impacts (p >0.05). CONCLUSION: These finding serve as considerations 
     for management decisions for rehabilitation professionals during 
     future disease outbreaks. Targeted support must be shown to employees 
     of older age and evaluating therapists. This shows that 
     administrators must consider implementing more equal spread of 
     patient contact to avoid serious impacts.]

     cardiovascular health. Objective assessments of cardiovascular 
     function assist in identifying the presence or absence of exertional 
     symptoms, and functional and physiological thresholds necessary to 
     inform safe and effective exercise programmes. This study aimed to 
     generate expert consensus on assessments of cardiovascular function 
     to support clinical decision-making for professionals providing 
     clinical exercise services. Design. Three-round e-Delphi. Methods. 
     Expert Exercise Physiologists and Physiotherapists were recruited to 
     participate in an e-Delphi. Experts were asked to list all objective 
     cardiovascular assessments deemed necessary to inform safe and 
     effective exercise prescription. In subsequent e-Delphi rounds, 
     experts rated the importance of each item, provided a rationale to 
     support their assertions, and reconsidered others' ratings and 
     rationale to shift or reaffirm their position. These results were 
     then translated into a clinical guidance document by the authors in 
     consultation with a Cardiologist and an experienced Exercise 
     Physiologist with expertise in cardiovascular assessment. Results. 
     Thirty-one experts participated in the e-Delphi and fourteen 
     participants completed all three rounds. Forty objective assessments 
     were initially suggested. Six items reached consensus by the end of 
     Round 2 (resting and exercise heart rate, resting, exercise, and 
     recovery blood pressure, and peak exercise-induced rating of 
     perceived exertion). One additional item reached consensus in Round 3 
     (exercise oxygen saturation). Conclusions. In the absence of research 
     evidence, the collective experience and insights of an expert panel 
     can inform an evidence gap. Further research is required to determine 
     the feasibility of implementing these seven assessments in practice 
     where CV assessment is indicated.]

     aroma solution in 58 dementia patients (29 each in the experimental 
     and control groups) admitted to a long-term care hospital in South 
     Korea. The experimental group received oral care with a solution 
     containing peppermint, tea tree, and lemon essential oils, and the 
     control group with a saline solution. The effectiveness of oral care 
     was assessed by the participants' oral condition, salivary pH, and 
     halitosis. The experimental group showed significant improvements 
     (P<.001) in all three outcomes, indicating that oral care with an

     downward and upward with a cane and a RW respectively. With the RW 
     use, downward walking show a faster velocity, higher cadence, less 
     stance time, bigger steps and strides than upward walking (p≤.05); 
     but no differences were seen with cane use. When comparing walking 
     between a RW and a cane, those using a cane had faster velocity, 
     larger step and stride lengths (P≤.01) but only during the upward 
     condition. Incline surface plays a critical role in gait differences 
     when walking with walking device. Geriatric professionals need to 
     know the changes in gait that result from the type of device being

     AB: Abstract. Objective. The objective of this study was to 
     investigate the impact of virtual reality-based exercise on the 
     quality of life, some balance variables, and depression among older 
     adults aged 60 years or older. Method. We systematically searched 
     five electronic databases. Results. Twenty-seven articles met our 
     inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis revealed that exercise using 
     virtual reality had a significant positive effect on overall quality 
     of life (p = 0.05), mental (p = 0.001) and physical component scores 
     (p = 0.01), social relation (p = 0.0002), psychological health(p = 
     0.01), physical health(p = 0.04), and environmental health (p = 
     0.04). Additionally, depression significantly improved following 
     virtual reality-based exercise (p = 0.01). However, there were 
     significant improvements in the balance berg scale (p<0.00001) and 
     ABC scale (p<0.00001) but not in timed-up-and-go(TUG) or 
     8-foot-up-and-go(8-FUG). Discussion. Virtual reality-based exercise 
     has a positive impact on various aspects of quality of life, BBS and 
     ABC scores, and depression. More studies with larger sample sizes and 
     less heterogeneity in design and assessments are required.]

     (SF) in older patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and examine 
     the mediating role of social support and depressive symptoms between 
     activities of daily living and SF. Methods. Using a convenience 
     sampling method, 205 older patients with CHF were recruited from 
     China between November 2021 and May 2022. Activities of daily living, 
     social support, depressive symptoms, and SF were assessed using a 
     self-administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed using structural 
     equation modeling. Results. The final model obtained a good fit. 
     Activities of daily living in older patients with CHF were directly 
     related to SF. The multiple mediation analysis revealed that the 
     relationship between activities of daily living and SF was mediated 
     by social support (effect: -0.010, 95% CI [-0.021, -0.003]) and 
     depressive symptoms (effect: -0.011, 95% CI [-0.019, -0.005) 
     separately, and serially (effect: -0.007, 95% CI [-0.012, -0.003). 
     Conclusions. Social support and depressive symptoms are multiple 
     mediating variables in the relationship between activities of daily 
     living and SF. Activities of daily living can improve patients' SF 
     through social support and depressive symptoms.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Although impairments in dorso-lumbar spine 
     mobility have been previously reported in patients with low back 
     pain, its exact mechanism is not yet clear. Therefore, the purpose of 
     this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate and 
     compare spinal kinematics between subjects with and without low back 
     pain and identify appropriate tools to evaluate it. Methods. The 
     PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched for 
     relevant literature. The search strategy was mainly focused on 
     studies investigating lumbar kinematics in subjects with and without 
     low back pain during clinical functional tests, gait, sports and 
     daily functional activities. Papers were selected if at least one of 
     these outputs was reported: lumbar range of motion, lumbar velocity, 
     lumbar acceleration and deceleration, lordosis angle or lumbar 
     excursion. Findings Among 804 papers, 48 met the review eligibility 
     criteria and 29 were eligible to perform a meta-analysis. Lumbar 
     range of motion was the primary outcome measured. A statistically 
     significant limitation of the lumbar mobility was found in low back 
     pain group in all planes, and in the frontal and transverse planes 
     for thoracic range of motion, but there is no significant limitation 
     for pelvic mobility. The amount of limitation was found to be more 
     important in the lumbar sagittal plane and during challenging 
     functional activities in comparison with simple activities. 
     Interpretation. The findings of this review provide insight into the 
     impact of low back pain on spinal kinematics during specific 
     movements, contributing to our understanding of this relationship and 
     suggesting potential clinical implications.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Lower limb prosthesis users exhibit high 
     rates of joint pain and disease, such as osteoarthritis, in their 
     intact limb. Overloading of their intact limb during daily activities 
     may be a contributing factor. Limb loading biomechanics have been 
     extensively studied during walking, but fewer investigations into 
     limb loading during other functional movements exist. The purpose of 
     this study was to characterize the lower limb loading of transtibial 
     prosthesis users during three common daily tasks: sit-to-stand, 
     squatting, and lifting. Methods. Eight unilateral transtibial 
     prosthesis users performed sit-to-stand (from three chair heights), 
     squatting, and lifting a 10 kg box. Peak vertical ground reaction 
     forces and peak knee flexion moments were computed for each limb 
     (intact and prosthetic) to characterize limb loading and asymmetry. 
     Ranges of motion of the intact and prosthetic ankles were also 
     quantified. Findings. Users had greater peak ground reaction forces 
     and knee flexion moments in their intact limb for all tasks (p < 
     0.02). On average, the intact limb had 36-48% greater peak ground 
     reaction forces and 168-343% greater peak knee flexion moments 
     compared to the prosthetic limb. The prosthetic ankle provided <10° 
     of ankle range of motion for all tasks, less than half the range of 
     motion provided by the intact ankle. Interpretation. Prosthesis users 
     overloaded their intact limb during all tasks. This asymmetric 
     loading may lead to an accumulation of damage to the intact limb 
     joints, such as the knee, and may contribute to the development of 
     osteoarthritis. Prosthetic design and rehabilitation interventions 
     that promote more symmetric loading should be investigated for these 
     tasks.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Children with unilateral cerebral palsy 
     often report difficulty with balance in everyday life. The single leg 
     stance test is a challenging task, requiring rapid sensory input and 
     precise motor adjustment. The purpose of this study was to examine 
     how children with cerebral palsy perform this test, compared to 
     typically developing children. Methods. Three-dimensional kinematics 
     of the trunk and lower limbs of 10 children with cerebral palsy and 
     15 children with typical development were captured as they performed 
     a single leg stance test on their non-dominant leg on a force 
     platform. Stance time, joint kinematics and centre of pressure sway 
     were measured and examined. Findings. There was evidence of shorter 
     single leg stance performance and increased mediolateral centre of 
     pressure sway in children with cerebral palsy. Coronal plane movement 
     at the subtalar joint and foot was reduced (−6.0° (−10.9, 
     −1.2°)), while proximally there was greater trunk movement in the 
     coronal (13.5° (2.4°, 24.5°)) and transverse planes (9.9° (0.7, 
     19°)) and pelvis movement in the transverse plane (6.1° (1.7, 
     10.5°). An association existed between stance time and mediolateral 
     centre of pressure sway (p < 0.01), with an average reduction in 
     stance time of 0.15 s for every 1 mm/s increase in mediolateral sway. 
     Interpretation. Children with cerebral palsy showed poor mediolateral 
     control of centre of pressure sway, leading to shorter stance time. 
     They have a less effective coronal foot-tilt strategy and excessive 
     trunk and pelvis movement. Interventions aimed at improving single 
     leg stance performance should consider addressing both ankle / foot 
     and trunk motor control.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The inherent nature of the torque-velocity 
     relationship is the inverse nature between the velocity of muscle 
     contraction and torque production and is an indication of muscle 
     function. The purpose of this study was to characterize the 
     torque-velocity relationship in the quadriceps following anterior 
     cruciate ligament reconstruction compared to healthy limbs. Methods. 
     681 participants were included, 493 of which were patients at least 
     four months following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (23.2 
     ± 10.08 yr, 6.6 ± 5.37 months post-surgery) and 188 were healthy 
     participants (21.6 ± 3.77 yr). A subset of 175 post-surgical 
     participants completed a repeated visit (8.1 ± 1.71 months 
     post-surgery). Participants completed isokinetic knee extension at 
     90°/s and 180°/s. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare torque 
     velocity relationships by limb type (surgical, contralateral, 
     healthy). Paired samples t-tests were conducted to analyze the 
     torque-velocity relationship across limbs and across time. Findings. 
     There was a large effect for limb type on torque-velocity (F(2, 1173) 
     = 146.08, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.20). Surgical limbs demonstrated 
     significantly lower torque-velocity relationships compared to the 
     contralateral limbs (ACLR: 0.26 Nm/kg, contralateral:0.55 Nm/kg, p < 
     0.001, d = 1.18). Healthy limbs had similar torque-velocity 
     relationships bilaterally (dominant limb: 0.48 Nm/kg, non-dominant 
     limb: 0.49 Nm/kg, p = 0.45). The torque velocity relationship for the 
     involved limb significantly increased in magnitude over time (+0.11 
     Nm/kg, p < 0.001, d = −0.61) while the contralateral limb 
     torque-velocity relationship remained stable over time (0.0 Nm/kg 
     difference, p = 0.60). Interpretation. Following surgery, the knee 
     extensors appear to have altered torque-velocity relationships 
     compared to contralateral and healthy limbs. This may indicate a 
     specific target for assessment and rehabilitation following surgery.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. In ankle fractures with syndesmotic injury, 
     the anatomic reduction of the ankle mortise is crucial for preventing 
     osteoarthritis. Yet, no studies have analysed the effect of surgical 
     reduction after unstable ankle fractures on patients' active 
     functional outcome. Methods. The Intraoperative 3D imaging data of 
     patients surgically treated between 2012 and 2019 for ankle fracture 
     with concomitant syndesmotic injury were reviewed. 58 patients were 
     allocated to two groups depending on whether the criteria for 
     radiologically optimal reduction were met (39 patients) or not (19 
     patients). Criteria for optimal reduction were composed of 
     objectively measured and subjectively rated data. After undertaking 
     the Olerud/Molander ankle score, a gait analysis and several active 
     function tests using 3D motion capture were performed in order to 
     evaluate kinetic and kinematic differences between both groups. 
     Findings. Patients showed deficits of range of motion and balance 
     parameters on the injured ankle, however, there were no significant 
     differences between both groups. Interpretation. Although, the data 
     did not show that radiological reduction criteria have a 
     statistically significant effect on active functional outcome after a 
     mean follow up time of 5.7 years, tendencies for a better outcome of 
     patients that met the criteria could be seen. It also must be taken 
     into consideration that results are limited by case number and 
     allocation ratio, which made a sub-analysis of the separate reduction 
     criteria unfeasible.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Individuals with unilateral transfemoral 
     amputation walk with increased levels of asymmetry, and this is 
     associated with reduced gait efficiency, back pain and overuse of the 
     intact limb. This study investigated the effect of walking with a 
     unilateral absence of loading response knee flexion on the symmetry 
     of anterior-posterior kinetics and centre of mass accelerations. 
     Methods. A retrospective cohort study design was used, assessing 
     three-dimensional gait data from individuals with unilateral 
     transfemoral amputation (n = 56). The anterior-posterior gait 
     variables analysed included; peak ground reaction forces, impulse, 
     centre of mass acceleration, as well as rate of vertical ground 
     reaction force increase in early stance. With respect to these 
     variables, this study assessed the symmetry between intact and 
     prosthetic limbs, compared intact limbs against a healthy unimpaired 
     control group, and evaluated effect on symmetry of microprocessor 
     controlled knee provision. Findings. Significant between-limb 
     asymmetries were found between intact and prosthetic limbs across all 
     variables (p < 0.0001). Intact limbs showed excessive loading when 
     compared with control group limbs after speed normalisation across 
     all variables (p < 0.0001). No improvement in kinetic symmetry 
     following microprocessor controlled knee provision was found. 
     Interpretation. The gait asymmetries for individuals with 
     transfemoral amputation identified in this study suggest that more 
     should be done by developers to address the resultant overloading of 
     the intact limb, as this is thought to have negative long-term 
     effects. The provision of microprocessor controlled knees did not 
     appear to improve the asymmetries faced by individuals with 
     transfemoral amputation, and clinicians should be aware of this when 
     managing patient expectations.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Myalgic encephalomyelitis is an 
     invalidating chronic disease often associated with exercise-induced 
     alterations of muscle membrane excitability (M wave). No simultaneous 
     measurements of maximal isometric force production and sarcolemma 
     fatigue in the same muscle group have been previously reported. We 
     hypothesized that M wave alterations could be partly responsible for 
     the reduced muscle force present in this invalidating disease. 
     Methods. This retrospective study compared two groups of patients who 
     presented (n = 30) or not (n = 28) alterations of M waves evoked by 
     direct muscle stimulation during and after a cycling exercise bout. 
     The maximal handgrip strength was measured before and after exercise, 
     concomitantly with electromyogram recordings from flexor digitorum 
     longus muscle. The patients also answered a questionnaire to identify 
     eventual exacerbation of their clinical symptoms following the 
     exercise test. Findings. The M wave amplitude significantly decreased 
     in muscles and the M wave duration significantly increased in the 
     group of patients with M wave alterations after exercise. Resting 
     values of handgrip were significantly lower in patients with 
     exercise-induced M-wave alterations than in patients without M-wave 
     abnormalities. In patients with exercise-induced M-wave alterations, 
     handgrip significantly decreased after exercise and the changes in 
     handgrip and M wave were positively correlated. The frequency of 
     post-exertion malaise, increased fatigue, myalgia, headache and 
     cognitive dysfunction was significantly higher in patients with 
     M-wave alterations and variations in handgrip after exercise.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Walking biomechanics are commonly affected 
     after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and differ compared 
     to uninjured controls. Manipulating task difficulty has been shown to 
     affect the magnitude of walking impairments in those early after knee 
     surgery but it is unclear if patients in later phases post-op are 
     similarly affected by differing task demands. Here, we evaluated the 
     effects of manipulating walking speed on between-limb differences in 
     ground reaction force and knee biomechanics in those with and without 
     anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods. We recruited 28 
     individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and 20 
     uninjured control participants to undergo walking assessments at 
     three speeds (self-selected, 120%, and 80% self-selected speed). Main 
     outcomes included sagittal plane knee moments, angles, excursions, 
     and ground reaction forces (vertical and anterior-posterior). 
     Findings. We observed walking speed differentially impacted force and 
     knee-outcomes in those with anterior cruciate ligament 
     reconstruction. Between-limb differences increased at fast and 
     decreased at slow speeds in those with anterior cruciate ligament 
     reconstruction while uninjured participants maintained between-limb 
     differences regardless of speed (partial η2 = 0.13-0.33, p < 0.05). 
     Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction patients underloaded the 
     surgical limb relative to both the contralateral, and uninjured 
     controls in GRFs and sagittal plane knee moments (partial η2 range = 
     0.13-0.25, p < 0.05). Interpretation. Overall, our findings highlight 
     the persistence of walking impairments in those with anterior 
     cruciate ligament reconstruction despite completing formal 
     rehabilitation. Further research should consider determining if those 
     displaying larger changes in gait asymmetries in response to fast 
     walking also exhibit poorer strength and/or joint health outcomes.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is 
     common after unaccustomed exercises and can restrict performance if 
     intense physical activities are performed while the muscle is still 
     sore. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery process following 
     exercise-induced DOMS over a seven-day period by evaluating sensory, 
     functional, and electromyographic parameters. Methods. Twenty-four 
     healthy males participated in four experimental sessions (Day-0, 
     Day-2, Day-4, Day-7). Pain perception, pressure pain sensitivity, 
     active range of motion, maximal isometric strength, and muscle 
     activity of the hamstrings during the maximal isometric contraction 
     were assessed bilaterally at each session. A single-leg deadlift 
     eccentric exercise (5-sets of 20-reps) was performed at the end of 
     Day-0 to induce DOMS in the dominant leg. Findings. At Day-2, the 
     DOMS-side showed increased pain sensitivity and decreased active 
     range of motion, strength and muscle activity compared to Day-0 (P < 
     0.015). Muscle activity on the DOMS-side reached similar values than 
     at baseline on Day-4, whereas pain perception, pressure pain 
     sensitivity, maximal isometric strength, and active range of motion 
     had returned to the baseline state on Day-7. No changes over time 
     were observed on the control-side, showing all variables an excellent 
     reliability between values at Day-0 and Day-7 (Intraclass Correlation 
     Coefficient > 0.90). Interpretation. Surface electromyographic values 
     during a maximal isometric contraction recover faster than the other 
     parameters. Given the heterogeneous path of altered variables towards 
     DOMS recovery, trainers and clinicians should consider a multimodal 
     assessment, including quantitative sensory and functional measures in 
     addition to the subjective perception of recovery.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Gait characteristics in children with 
     cerebral palsy vary according to their individual walking speed. As 
     such, establishing methods to maintain a consistent gait velocity are 
     necessary to evaluate specific intervention effects in this clinical 
     population. Our study aim was to validate the accuracy of projection 
     mapping for guiding gait velocity to a control gait velocity. 
     Methods. This was a cross-sectional study of 13 children with 
     cerebral palsy (mean age [standard deviation] of 12.42 [2.31] years). 
     The target velocity was calculated from the average speed obtained 
     across three trials of self-selected walking speed. A virtual reality 
     system with four projectors was used to project an image onto the 
     floor to guide children to match two gait conditions: 100% and 125% 
     velocity of the average speed. Participants completed three gait 
     trials at each velocity under image guidance. Gait velocity was 
     quantified using a 3-dimensional motion capture system. Bland-Altman 
     plots were used to analyze systematic errors and the limits of 
     agreement calculated. Findings. The results indicated the limits of 
     agreement were acceptable for 0.10 m/s for 100% velocity and 0.12 m/s 
     for 125% velocity. Therefore, projection mapping was effective in 
     guiding children to adjust their gait to the intended velocity. 
     Interpretation. Projection mapping is a novel method for guiding 
     children with cerebral palsy to walk at a controlled target velocity 
     that may improve the reliability of gait analysis.]

     AB: ABSTRACT. Purpose. Linear acoustic indices are significantly 
     influenced by speaking voice intensity. The main aim of this work was 
     to compare acoustic measures based on linear and nonlinear models in 
     different speaking voice intensity levels and to analyze the 
     reliability of those measures in different intensity levels in 
     subjects with voice disorders. Methods. 435 samples from subjects 
     (314 women, 121 men with a mean age of 41.07 ± 13.73) diagnosed with 
     various voice disorders were used. In total, 17 acoustic measures 
     were derived from the vowel /ɛ/ sustained at three intensity levels 
     (soft, comfortable, and loud). Five were linear (standard deviation 
     of the fundamental frequency (f0), jitter, shimmer, 
     harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) and smoothed cepstral peak prominence 
     (CPPS)), and twelve were nonlinear measures, namely correlation 
     dimension (D2), correlation entropy (H2), first minimum of the mutual 
     information function (FMMI), relative entropy (ENTR-R), largest 
     Lyapunov exponent (Lyap), determinism (DET), transitivity, mean 
     diagonal line length (Lmed), Shannon entropy (ENTR-S), mean length of 
     vertical structures, also known as trapping time (TT), laminarity 
     (LAM) and recurrence period density entropy (RPDE). Differences 
     between speaking voice intensity levels were assessed by Friedman's 
     test and Nemenyi as posthoc test. Intraclass correlation coefficient 
     was used to investigate if each acoustic measure remains in agreement 
     (reliability) between different voice intensity levels. Results. 
     There were significant differences in all acoustic measures about 
     vocal intensity level (P < 0.001). Intraclass correlation coefficient 
     was very good for HNR (>0.61) and good for Lyap, DET, ENTR-S, Lmed, 
     RPDE, and TT (0.41-0.60). Conclusions. All acoustic measures varied 
     as a function of vocal intensity in voice disordered adults, while 
     this relation was different for linear and nonlinear measures. Only 
     the measures HNR, Lyap, DET, ENTR-S, Lmed, RPDE and TT had an 
     acceptable reliability between different voice intensity levels. 
     Therefore, patient`s voice SPL should be controlled or indicated 
     during acoustic vocal assessment.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Vibrotactile Feedback (VF) using wearable 
     devices is an emerging treatment option for hypophonia in Individuals 
     with Parkinson's disease (IwPD). Studies evaluating the effectiveness 
     of VF in improving conversational vocal intensity in real-life 
     environment in IwPD are limited. Objective. To determine the effect 
     of VF on conversational vocal intensity and compare vocal intensity 
     between a) clinic and real-life environment b) VF and Lee Silverman 
     Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®)vs. VF alone in IwPD using a portable 
     voice monitor (VocaLog2). Methods. Eight individuals with hypophonia 
     secondary to PD were randomly assigned to two treatment groups- VF 
     and LSVT LOUD® (Group 1) and VF (Group 2). VF was provided using 
     VocaLog2 device. Duration of treatment was 4 weeks for both groups. 
     Vocal intensity was measured in the real-life environment at 
     baseline, during treatment, and at one-month follow-up. Vocal 
     intensity in clinic was obtained at baseline and one-month follow-up. 
     Voice Handicap Index (VHI) questionnaire was administered at baseline 
     and one-month follow-up. Results. There was no significant difference 
     in conversational vocal intensity between a) clinic and real-life 
     environment at any point of time b) baseline and follow up for both 
     treatment groups c) the two treatment groups at baseline, during each 
     of the 4 weeks of treatment and at follow up d) VHI baseline and one 
     month follow up scores. Conclusion. VF, including when combined with 
     LSVT LOUD®, is limited in improving conversational vocal intensity 
     in real-life in IwPD. The effects of frequency and duration of VF on 
     conversational vocal intensity must be systematically investigated 
     using large scale studies in IwPD.]

     AB: Summary. Objectives. Exercise-induced dyspnea (EID) can disrupt 
     an athlete's participation and performance in their given sport. 
     Differential diagnosis of EID is often completed using subjective 
     report and may be inaccurate, therefore increasing the frustration 
     and stress of the athlete. This nonexperimental research study was 
     used to determine prevalence of EID and related respiratory symptoms 
     in athletes at a small, Division I university. Methods. An anonymous 
     survey was provided to athletes at Murray State University as they 
     registered for participation in sports for the 2020-2021 school year. 
     Data from this survey was analyzed as to reported physician-given 
     diagnosis of a respiratory disorder as well as reported symptoms of 
     EID. Results. Results showed that athletes with a physician-given 
     diagnosis often did not report symptoms or responses to medications 
     that support that diagnosis. Additionally, athletes frequently 
     reported symptoms of EID without a formal diagnosis of a respiratory 
     disorder. Conclusions. These findings provide preliminary insight and 
     pilot data that may be used to understand the prevalence of EID in 
     collegiate athletes and the need for improved methods of diagnosis 
     for etiologies of EID.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. This study aims to present rare pediatric 
     voice disorders, which are usually reported as case reports in the 
     literature, with their clinical features, treatment options, and 
     prognosis, and to emphasize clinical findings that may be associated 
     with rare diseases. Methods. The clinical records of the pediatric 
     patients presented with dysphonia were reviewed between 2014 and 
     2019. The terminology "rare disease" is used to describe diseases 
     where the average prevalence thresholds are between 40 to 50 
     cases/100,000 people. Age, gender, symptoms, laryngeal examination 
     findings, histopathological results, treatment modalities and 
     follow-up results of rare laryngeal pathologies were reviewed. 
     Results. 274 children were diagnosed with and treated for voice 
     disorders at our institution. Seven patients were identified with 
     rare laryngeal pathologies. Four patients diagnosed with lipoid 
     proteinosis, two patients with neurofibroma and one patient with 
     amyloidosis. One patient was known to have neurofibromatosis type-1, 
     while the others did not have any previously diagnosed diseases, 
     dysphonia was the initial clinical presentation. Conclusion. There 
     are some clues that bring to mind rare entities. Firstly, these 
     patients generally present with various systemic manifestations. 
     Secondly, if there is any discrepancy between voice quality and 
     endoscopic laryngeal examination, the diagnosis should be 
     reconsidered. Thirdly, in the case of the prolonged dysphonia 
     recalcitrant to treatment, the clinician should reassess the 
     treatment or the diagnosis.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. To evaluate adult remote performance in speech 
     discrimination on the Temple Assessment of Language and Short-term 
     Memory in Aphasia (TALSA), and to compare to remote performance in 
     NU-6 word repetition and participant ratings of self-perceived 
     hearing ability obtained via remote session. Method. Sixty older 
     adults completed TALSA speech discrimination of concrete, low 
     frequency words and of non-words via telephone. Remote repetition of 
     words controlled for sound frequency was assessed using the 
     Northwestern University (NU-6) word lists administered in live voice 
     and recorded voice conditions. Forty-six of the participants 
     completed questionnaires about their hearing via Zoom 
     videoconference. Results. Mean performance in TALSA speech 
     discrimination for words was similar to performance in NU-6 word 
     repetition. Word repetition of NU-6 lists did not differ 
     significantly for live voice versus recorded voice conditions. TALSA 
     non-word speech discrimination was significantly worse than TALSA 
     speech discrimination for words and was associated with age and 
     self-reported hearing ability. Conclusions. TALSA speech 
     discrimination can be administered remotely to evaluate potential 
     perceptual influences on auditory comprehension. In remote 
     assessment, participants demonstrated the expected pattern of more 
     accurate speech discrimination for word stimuli than for non-words. 
     The non-word TALSA condition may be particularly useful for detecting 
     speech perception impairment, both in face-to-face and telepractice 
     sessions. Similar performance of participants in both live voice and 
     recorded conditions of the NU-6 word lists suggests that recordings 
     used in SLP receptive language or memory assessment, including the 
     TALSA, need not be abandoned in favor of live voice to support 
     audition during telepractice.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Phonetic-phonological impairments have 
     been described in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
     whether the likely phonological-linguistic changes progress with the 
     evolution of the disease or whether phonetic-motor manifestations 
     occur in all three stages of AD (mild, moderate, and severe) has not 
     yet been clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to verify whether 
     phonological-linguistic and phonetic-motor speech manifestations 
     occur in the mild, moderate, and severe stages of AD. Methods.Thirty 
     participants in each stage of probable AD (mild, moderate, and 
     severe) and 30 healthy older adults underwent cognitive, instrumental 
     activities of daily living and phonetic-phonological assessments. 
     Phonetic-phonological manifestations were classified into three 
     types: likely phonetic-motor, likely phonological-linguistic, and 
     manifestations that may occur in disorders of both phonetic and 
     phonological origin. Results. The manifestations analyzed in this 
     study occurred rarely. The manifestations that may occur in disorders 
     of both phonetic and phonological origin were the most common in all 
     stages of the disease. The likely phonetic-motor manifestations 
     emerged during the mild stage of the disease (distortions, prolonged 
     intersegment duration, and vowel prolongations), while the likely 
     phonological-linguistic manifestations were present mainly in the 
     moderate (substitutions and attempts at the word level) and severe 
     stages (substitutions, attempts at the word level, self-corrections, 
     and anticipations). The occurrence of phonetic-phonological 
     manifestations increased with disease progression. Conclusions. The 
     type of phonological and phonetic manifestations in the individuals 
     with AD differed according to the dementia stage and were 
     statistically more frequent as dementia worsened.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Individuals living with aphasia (IWA) are 
     more likely than stroke survivors without aphasia to experience 
     depression, anxiety, stress, and social isolation due to 
     communication difficulties, social and life barriers, and 
     neurobiological changes (Hilari, 2011). Researchers in the U.K. 
     Australia, and elsewhere have surveyed speech-language pathologists 
     (SLPs) to ascertain their training and confidence in addressing the 
     psychosocial well-being of IWA (Northcott et al. 2017; Sekhon et al. 
     2015). To date, no similar survey has been performed in the U.S. The 
     aim of this study was to survey the perspectives of U.S. SLPs on 
     addressing the psychosocial well-being of IWA. Methods. The survey 
     questions were drawn from Northcott et al. (2017), with adjustments 
     for a U.S. audience and additional questions. We conducted a 
     Qualtrics survey which remained open from November 2021 through May 
     2022 and collected 101 responses. Responses to the closed questions 
     were analyzed using descriptive statistics and open-ended responses 
     were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Results. Some of the 
     most significant findings of this survey include the low levels of 
     confidence in addressing psychological health, lack of training among 
     SLPs, and rarity of successful collaboration with mental health 
     professionals. In comparison to surveys conducted in other countries, 
     many overarching themes were similar, but there was some variation in 
     specific responses and patterns. Categories emerging from the 
     open-ended responses included the need for more trained mental health 
     professionals, improved collaboration, and emphasis on the importance 
     of the topic. Conclusions. This research highlights the necessity of 
     increased training, as well as improved interprofessional 
     collaboration between SLPs and mental health professionals. 
     Limitations of the study include the potential bias of respondents, 
     as well as the number and scope of the questions and responses. 
     Future studies can employ interviews, trial models for collaboration, 
     and partner with IWA to explore their experiences with psychosocial 
     health support and services.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Aphasia book clubs were developed to 
     support connecting with literature and reading for pleasure within an 
     aphasia-friendly environment. Bibliotherapy is an evidence-based 
     therapeutic approach, in which a book is selected to address the 
     challenges facing the reader. Its aim is to facilitate a deeper 
     understanding of a lived experience in order to promote healing, 
     strategy development, and adjustment. Aphasia book clubs provide an 
     opportunity to discuss books about the challenges associated with 
     aphasia. A recent book, Identity theft: Rediscovering ourselves after 
     stroke recounts the stroke recovery story of Dr. Debra Meyerson and 
     22 other stroke survivors. Identity Theft focuses on the need to 
     reconstruct positive identities despite remaining disabilities to 
     facilitate rebuilding rewarding lives. The purpose of this study is 
     to understand the impact of reading Identity Theft in an aphasia book 
     club for people with aphasia (PwA). Method. 27 PwA read the book 
     Identity Theft in one of four online aphasia book clubs offered by 
     two universities. Weekly discussions were facilitated by graduate SLP 
     students under the supervision of experienced clinicians. At the end 
     of the 10 week program, semi-structured qualitative interviews were 
     conducted with participants to understand the lived experience. 
     Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results. 
     Analysis of the interview data generated four main themes and 13 
     subthemes. The main themes included: Mechanism for Reflection, Power 
     of Community, Engaged Learning, and Therapeutic Environment. 
     Interview extracts illustrate the way these themes support increasing 
     self-efficacy and rebuilding a positive identity. Conclusion. The 
     themes align positively with outcomes associated with the 
     bibliotherapy process. Themes also integrate into a self-management 
     model that promotes self-efficacy through education, support, 
     awareness, problem solving and goal setting. Caveats included 
     determining participant readiness to examine recovery issues and 
     facilitator preparation. Aphasia book clubs surrounding psychosocial 
     texts may help PwA reconstruct a positive post-stroke identity.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Language Mixing (LM) occurs among neurotypical 
     bilinguals as well as among bilingual persons with aphasia (BiPWAs). 
     The current study aimed to investigate whether LM in BiPWAs stems 
     from a linguistic impairment, an impairment in cognitive control, or 
     both. Method. Twenty Russian-Hebrew-speaking BiPWAs were split into 
     two groups based on aphasia severity (Severe/Moderate vs. Mild). 
     Frequencies and patterns of LM in narrative production by BiPWAs in 
     L1-Russian and in L2-Hebrew were analyzed. To investigate the 
     underlying mechanisms of LM, all participants completed linguistic 
     background questionnaires, the Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) in both 
     languages, and a battery of 10 cognitive tests. Results. The results 
     indicated an effect of aphasia severity and an effect of language. 
     Higher LM frequency was observed in BiPWAs with severe/moderate 
     aphasia symptoms as compared to BiPWAs with mild symptoms. In both 
     groups, higher LM frequency was observed in L2-Hebrew narratives, the 
     weaker post-stroke language for most participants in the sample. The 
     results also showed qualitative LM differences in L1-Russsian and 
     L2-Hebrew contexts. In L1-Russian narratives, BiPWAs mainly switched 
     to L2-Hebrew nouns, while in L2-Hebrew narratives, they mainly 
     inserted L1-Russian discourse markers and function words. 
     Conclusions. Linguistic factors such as pre- and post-stroke 
     self-rated language proficiency and level of language impairment due 
     to aphasia were found to predict LM frequency in L1-Russian and in 
     L2-Hebrew. Cognitive abilities did not predict LM frequency. Based on 
     our findings, we suggest that LM behavior in BiPWAs might be 
     primarily related to language skills in L1 and L2, rather than to 
     cognitive control impairments]

     AB: Abstract.This paper describes the changes in communication 
     skills, knowledge and confidence in Speech Language Therapy (SLT) 
     students in conversations with People With Aphasia (PWA) after 
     Training Con-tAct, a Dutch Communication Partner Training. Methods. 
     On a voluntary basis, nine SLT students (2nd yr) completed Training 
     Con-tAct, in which People With Aphasia (PWA) were involved as 
     co-workers. A mixed method design with pre- and post-measures was 
     used to analyze the students' communication skills, knowledge and 
     confidence. A quantitative video analysis was used to measure changes 
     in students' communication skills. Besides, a self-report 
     questionnaire was used to measure the changes in students' knowledge 
     and confidence regarding their communication with PWA. To evaluate 
     the perspectives of the students on Training Con-tAct, additionally a 
     focus group interview was held. Results. Regarding students' 
     communication skills the outcomes revealed a significantly higher 
     score on the 'supporting' competence in students who took part in 
     Training Con-tAct. The mean scores for the 'acknowledging' and 
     'checking information' competences did not improve significantly. The 
     outcomes of the questionnaire showed students gained more knowledge 
     and confidence regarding communication with PWA. The focus group 
     interview provided insights into: motivation for participating in 
     Communication Partner Training, content and structure of the 
     training, feedback in CPT, and learning experiences. Conclusion. The 
     present study suggests that SLT students may benefit from Training 
     Con-tAct as the training leads to better skills, more knowledge about 
     aphasia and more confidence in communicating with PWA. Training 
     Con-tAct could be a valuable addition to the curricula of all 
     healthcare disciplines, and eventually support interprofessional 
     collaboration, resulting in improved access to health care, which is 
     important for communication vulnerable people. Further research with 
     a larger sample size and a control group is required.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. This study investigated the level of 
     satisfaction with life (SWL) in a group of cochlear implant (CI) 
     users who had been prelingually deaf but were orally educated. They 
     had received one or two CIs (as a child, adolescent, or adult) and 
     were highly competent Polish speakers. This study looked at three 
     factors that may affect SWL - psychosocial, deafness/hearing and 
     communication related, and sociodemographic. Methods.The participants 
     were prelingually deaf CI users who had learned highly competent 
     spoken Polish as their primary language. They had been educated in 
     mainstream or integrated schools (not schools for the deaf), and had 
     no other disability or severe illness. Measurements were done with 5 
     questionnaires: the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), the I-Others 
     Questionnaire, the. Patient: Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Deaf 
     Identity Development Scale (DIDS), and the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant 
     Questionnaire (NCIQ). Results. The SWL level of the group was similar 
     to that of the standard Polish population. SWL was positively related 
     to positive self-perception, acceptance of oneself as a deaf person, 
     and to perceiving the benefits of having a CI (as measured by three 
     NCIQ domains: self-esteem, activity limitations, and social 
     interactions). On the other hand, negative self-perception, marginal 
     deaf identity, and depressive symptoms were negatively related to 
     SWL. There was no relationship between SWL and knowledge of sign 
     language. Lower depressive symptoms and greater hearing loss were 
     both significant predictors of SWL, although those who used two CIs 
     generally had a lower SWL. Conclusions. Prelingually deaf CI users 
     with low SWL require psychological support in many spheres, including 
     working through problems of deaf identity, self-acceptance, and 
     depression. Additional research should involve diverse DHH CI users, 
     including those with limited spoken Polish competency or sign 
     language skills, as well as members of the Polish Deaf community.]

     AB: Abstract. The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected the 
     health and well-being of marginalized communities, and it brought 
     greater awareness to disparities in health care access and 
     utilization. Addressing these disparities is difficult because of 
     their multidimensional nature. Predisposing factors (demographic 
     information, social structure, and beliefs), enabling factors (family 
     and community) and illness levels (perceived and evaluated illness) 
     are thought to jointly contribute to such disparities. Research has 
     demonstrated that disparities in access and utilization of 
     speech-language pathology and laryngology services are the result of 
     racial and ethnic differences, geographic factors, sex, gender, 
     educational background, income level and insurance status. For 
     example, persons from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds have been 
     found to be less likely to attend or adhere to voice rehabilitation, 
     and they are more likely to delay health care due to language 
     barriers, longer wait times, a lack of transportation and 
     difficulties contacting their physician. The purpose of this paper is 
     to summarize existing research on telehealth, discuss how telehealth 
     offers the potential to eliminate some disparities in the access and 
     utilization of voice care, review its limitations, and encourage 
     continued research in this area. A clinical perspective from a large 
     volume laryngology clinic in a major city in northeastern United 
     States highlights the use of telehealth in the provision of voice 
     care by a laryngologist and speech-language pathologist during and 
     after the COVID19 pandemic.]

     resilience in pediatric ADHD is important though highly understudied. 
     Aims: The current study sought to provide a preliminary 'shortlist' 
     of key individual, family, and social-community assets among children 
     with ADHD. Methods and Procedures: The study included 
     well-characterized, clinically-evaluated samples of children with 
     (n=108) and without ADHD (n=98) ages 8-13 years (M=10.31; 41.3% 
     girls; 66.5% White/Non-Hispanic). All subsets regression and 
     dominance analysis identified the subset of predictors that accounted 
     for the most variance in broad-based resilience for children with 
     ADHD and their relative importance. Findings were compared for 
     children with versus without ADHD as preliminary evidence regarding 
     the extent to which identified assets are promotive, protective, or 
     conditionally helpful. Outcomes and. Results: Higher levels of peer 
     acceptance, social skills, and academic performance were top 
     predictors of resilience among children with ADHD. Better child 
     working memory, attention, higher levels of hyperactivity, older age, 
     and fewer parent self-reported mental health concerns were also 
     identified as predictors of resilience in ADHD. Both overlapping and 
     unique factors were associated with resilience for children with 
     versus without ADHD. Conclusions and. Results: These results, if 
     replicated, provide a strong preliminary basis for strength-based 
     basic/applied research on key assets that promote resilience in 
     ADHD.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The impact of disability differs across 
     cultures. This study aimed to determine the predictors of 
     participation in children with cerebral palsy (CP) in Turkey, based 
     on the six F-words. Methods. Cross-sectional study exploring 
     participation profiles of 450 children with CP, aged between 2 and 18 
     years. Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) evaluated 
     functional skills, and Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE-H) version 3.0 
     assessed daily and social participation. Hierarchical linear 
     regression models were done to determine the predictors of 
     participation in daily activities (PDA) and social roles (PSR) in 
     three age groups (2-4, 5-13 and 14-18 years) based on the 6 F-words 
     (mobility of PEDI for 'fitness'; four classification systems and 
     self-care of PEDI for 'functioning'; social functions of PEDI for 
     'friends'; demographic information by parents for 'family'; the 
     recreation of LIFE-H for 'fun'; and different stages of development 
     for 'future'). Results. The most important predictors for total PDA 
     by age group were: self-care (p = 0.012) of PEDI in 2-4 y; self-care 
     (p = 0.001) and mobility (p = 0.005) of PEDI in 5-13 y; GMFCS (p = 
     0.006) and mobility (p = 0.002) of PEDI in 14-18 y. Significant 
     predictors for PSR differed by age group: self-care (p = 0.001) of 
     PEDI in 2-4 y; self-care (p = 0.023) and mobility (p = 0.006) of PEDI 
     in 5-13 y; and GMFCS (p = 0.004) and MACS (p = 0.003) in 14-18 y. 
     Conclusions. Six F-words of function and fitness focussed on 
     self-care in younger children with an increasing emphasis on mobility 
     and ability levels according to age. Therefore, rehabilitation for 
     different aspects of the functional levels is needed to improve 
     participation in life across the six F-words framework; plus take 
     into consideration context, age-differences, family's expectations, 
     life requirements, environmental needs, and cultural differences.]

     AB: Summary. Insights related to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis 
     (OA) have informed rehabilitative treatments that aim to mitigate the 
     influence of several known impairments and risk factors for OA, with 
     the goal to improve pain, function, and quality of life. The purpose 
     of this invited narrative review is to provide fundamental knowledge 
     to non-specialists about exercise and education, diet, biomechanical 
     interventions, and other physical therapist-delivered treatments. In 
     addition to summarizing the rationale for common rehabilitative 
     therapies, we provide a synthesis of current core recommendations. 
     Robust evidence based on randomized clinical trials supports exercise 
     with education and diet as core treatments for OA. Structured, 
     supervised exercise therapy is advised. The mode of exercise may vary 
     but should be individualized. The dose should be based on an initial 
     assessment, the desired physiological changes, and progressed when 
     appropriate. Diet combined with exercise is strongly recommended and 
     studies demonstrate a dose-response relationship between the 
     magnitude of weight loss and symptom improvement. Recent evidence 
     suggests the use of technology to remotely deliver exercise, diet and 
     education interventions is cost-effective. Although several studies 
     support the mechanisms for biomechanical interventions (e.g. bracing, 
     shoe inserts) and physical therapist-delivered (passive) treatments 
     (e.g. manual therapy, electrotherapeutic modalities) fewer rigorous 
     randomized trials support their clinical use; these therapies are 
     sometimes recommended as adjuncts to core treatments. The mechanisms 
     of action for all rehabilitative interventions include contextual 
     factors such as attention and placebo effects. These effects can 
     challenge our interpretation of treatment efficacy from clinical 
     trials, yet also provide opportunities to maximize patient outcomes 
     in clinical practice. When evaluating rehabilitative interventions, 
     the field may benefit from increased emphasis on research that 
     considers contextual factors while evaluating mechanistic, 
     longer-term, clinically-important and policy-relevant outcome 
     measures.]

     among physically active women. Design. A cross-sectional survey was 
     completed by 3705 women (median age = 40 years [quartile 1, quartile 
     3: 30, 45], body mass index = 22.1 kg/m2 [20.5, 24.2]) representing 
     multiple nationalities and sports via the STRAVA™ exercise 
     application. Respondents selected the amount of time they 
     participated in low intensity, moderate intensity, and high intensity 
     exercise training per week. Amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea was defined as 
     self-reporting ≤ 10 menses in the last year. Methods. Associations 
     between weekly exercise volume for low intensity training, moderate 
     intensity training, and high intensity training and 
     amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea were modeled with univariate logistic 
     regression models, followed by adjustment for age and body mass 
     index. Results. Amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea prevalence was 16 % (n = 
     576/3705), with no difference by country of origin or most sport 
     modes. In adjusted models, participating in low intensity training 
     ≥ 7 h/week or moderate intensity training ≥ 6 h/week was 
     associated with 1.43 (95 % confidence interval: 1.04-1.96) and 1.46 
     (1.10-1.95) greater odds of amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea compared to 2 
     to 3 h/week, respectively. Similarly, high intensity training ≥ 5 
     h/week was associated with 1.41 (1.03-1.92) greater odds of 
     amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea compared to 1 to 2 h/week. Participating in 
     low intensity training for ≤ 30 min/week compared to 2 to 3 h/week 
     was associated with reduced amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea odds (0.65 
     [0.44-0.94]). Conclusions. Taken together, these associations suggest 
     greater weekly exercise volume, irrespective of intensity, may 
     increase amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea risk among physically active 
     women.]

     Cross-sectional survey. Methods. Non-elite netballers aged > 14 years 
     were recruited from Australia, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. 
     Participants completed an online survey regarding their last ankle 
     sprain and were queried regarding health care sought, health 
     professionals consulted, treatments received, time missed, and 
     return-to-play clearance. Data were described using number

     Descriptive statistics were presented for management practices. 
     Results. We received 1592 responses from Australian (n = 846), United 
     Kingdom (n = 454), and New Zealand (n = 292) netballers. Three in 
     five (n = 951, 60 %) sought health care. Of those, most consulted a

     care than Australian and New Zealand netballers (Australia: 60 % vs 
     United Kingdom: 53 % vs New Zealand: 68 %, p < 0.001), consulted a 
     physiotherapist (Australia: 79 %, United Kingdom: 63 %, New Zealand:

     returned to play within 1-7 days (Australia: 25 %, United Kingdom: 15 
     %, New Zealand: 21 %) and fewer United Kingdom netballers received 
     return-to-play clearance (Australia: 28 %, United Kingdom: 10 %, New 
     Zealand: 28 %). Conclusions. Health-seeking behaviours are adopted by 
     some, but not all netballers after an ankle sprain. For those who 
     sought care, most consulted a physiotherapist and were prescribed 
     exercise-based interventions and external ankle support, but few 
     received return-to-play clearance. Comparing countries, United 
     Kingdom netballers had lower health-seeking behaviours and received 
     less best-practice management than Australian and New Zealand

     AB: Abstract. Background. Prior research has shown that stuttering is 
     a complex and individualized condition. The Overall Assessment of the 
     Speaker's Experience of Stuttering (OASES; Yaruss & Quesal, 2016) is 
     a well-researched tool that measures the impact of stuttering on an 
     individual's life. This study has used the Polish version of the 
     OASES to examine the experience of stuttering among Polish people who 
     stutter. Method. The original, English version of the OASES was 
     translated into Polish. Reliability and validity for the Polish 
     version were evaluated. Comparisons were made between samples from 
     Poland and the United States for all of the sections and for the 
     overall results of the OASES-S, OASES-T, and OASES-A. To explore the 
     structure of the stuttering experience, a factor structure of the 
     OASES was conducted. Results. Like other versions of the OASES, the 
     OASES-Polish (OASES-PL) demonstrated good reliability and validity. 
     Cross-cultural comparisons have shown that Polish school-age children 
     had significantly lower knowledge and awareness of stuttering than 
     children in the United States (USA). Factor analysis further revealed 
     that the structure of the experience of stuttering is similar across 
     all age groups, but the importance of the particular aspects of 
     stuttering varies at different stages of life. Conclusion. The 
     OASES-PL is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the impact 
     of stuttering on Polish people who stutter and can therefore be used 
     as a clinical tool. Polish results were relatively similar to those 
     from the USA, though there were subtle cross-cultural differences 
     that are worthy of further exploration. Educational objectives. After 
     reading the article, the participant will be able: (1) to describe 
     the diverse experiences of Polish people who stutter at different 
     ages, (2) to explain the importance of quality of life analysis in 
     diagnosis and speech therapy with people who stutter, and (3) to 
     explain the breadth of the stuttering phenomenon among Polish 
     individuals who stutter.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Available studies of working memory (WM) in 
     speakers who stutter tend to rely on parent report, focus on 
     phonological WM, or measure WM in combination with other processes. 
     The present research aimed to: (1) compare complex WM in adults who 
     stutter (AWS) and adults who do not stutter (AWNS); (2) characterize 
     group performance patterns; and (2) determine whether WM predicts 
     stuttering severity. Methods. Eighteen AWS and 20 AWNS completed 
     parallel verbal and spatial span tasks in which to-be-remembered 
     items were interleaved with a distracting task across varying set 
     sizes. Dependent variables included the number of correctly recalled 
     items, accuracy on distraction tasks, and detailed analyses of 
     item-level responses. We further examined whether span scores 
     predicted subjective and objective measures of stuttering severity. 
     Results. Relative to AWNS, AWS showed poorer recall, specifically on 
     short set sizes in the spatial task. Groups performed similarly on 
     distraction tasks and showed comparable error patterns. Predictive 
     relationships differed by span task and severity measure. Lower 
     verbal span scores predicted greater stuttering impact and more overt 
     stuttering behaviors; lower spatial span scores predicted lower 
     impact and was unrelated to overt behaviors. Conclusions. Findings 
     suggest that AWS differ subtly from AWNS in WM performance. Group 
     differences became more apparent under certain task conditions but 
     could not be attributed to specific underlying processes. Data 
     further indicated a complex relationship between WM and stuttering 
     severity. Overall, results corroborate previous studies linking 
     stuttering to domain-general weaknesses, but highlight the need for 
     additional research to clarify the nature of this relationship.]

     responses to the OASES-A-SC were collected in an online self-help 
     community of people in China who stutter. Descriptive analyses were 
     conducted to obtain the understanding of how stuttering impacts the

     significantly higher in the impact severity level. Conclusion. The 
     results showed that people in China who stutter have more adverse 
     experiences related to stuttering compared with their counterparts in 
     western or developed countries. Higher negative attitudes toward 
     stuttering in China, social stigma against people with disabilities, 
     and the fewer professional supports were discussed to be associated 
     with this more adverse experience. Cultural differences such as a 
     greater power distance and higher collectivism in Chinese culture 
     were considered to be associated with the elevated level of adverse 
     impact of stuttering in China.]

     attentional shifts on speechmotor control in adults who stutter (AWS) 
     and adults who do not stutter (ANS) when speaking under low and high 
     social stress conditions. Method. Thirteen AWS' and 10 ANS' lip 
     aperture (LA) and posterior tongue (PT) movements were assessed under 
     a Cued-Internal and Cued-External attentional focus condition with 
     and without social stress induction (i.e. speaking to an audience). 
     Skin conductance levels were used to measure a stress response. 
     Speech motor control was assessed by measuring movement duration and 
     variability of movement for LA and PT using the spatial temporal 
     index (STI). Results. A significant Group x Condition interaction was 
     found for LA STI. Post-hoc comparisons indicated AWS' LA STI 
     significantly decreased under Cued External Focus conditions during 
     both low and high social stress. No significant Group x Condition 
     interaction was found for PT STI. AWS showed significantly slower 
     tongue movements (PT) across all low and high social stress 
     conditions; however, there was no significant Group x Condition 
     interaction for PT or LA. Discussion. Findings yield preliminary 
     insights into the role of attentional focus on speech motor control 
     when speaking during high social stress. Theoretical and clinical

     auditory verbal working memory in adults who do (AWS) and do not 
     (AWNS) stutter using a highly demanding linguistic N-back task. 
     Methods. Fifteen AWS and 15 AWNS matched in age, gender and 
     educational level were asked to hear series of words and respond by 
     pressing a "yes" button if the word they just heard was the same as 
     the word one, two, or three trials back. Words were either 
     phonologically similar (i.e. Phonological Linguistic Condition) or 
     phonologically dissimilar (i.e. Neutral Linguistic Condition). 
     Accuracy and false alarms rates as well as reaction time on correct 
     target trials, missed target trials and false alarms were collected 
     and analyzed. Results. Differences were not found between AWS and 
     AWNS in accuracy. Both groups were more accurate and significantly 
     faster in 1- followed by 2- followed by 3-back trials. However, AWS 
     were significantly slower than AWNS in the 2-back level, regardless 
     of linguistic condition. Furthermore, AWS demonstrated more false 
     alarms compared to AWNS. Conclusion. Results revealed differences in 
     auditory verbal working memory and interference control between AWS 
     and AWNS when processing highly linguistically demanding stimuli.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Using word- and nonword-reading passages in 
     Kannada, which has a transparent orthography, we attempted to 
     determine (a) whether orthographic differences between English and 
     Kannada may explain the observed differences in stutter rates on 
     nonwords, and (b) whether longer nonwords, like words, incur higher 
     rates of stutters. Methods.Stutters are defined as sound or syllable 
     repetitions, sound prolongations, broken words or nonwords (a pause 
     within a word or nonword), abnormal pauses, and intrusive vowel-like 
     sounds. Twenty-six persons, who stutter, read the word and nonword 
     passages. The nonwords were created by changing the first syllable of 
     each word; otherwise words and nonwords were equivalent in length and 
     syllable structure. Stutters were counted from audio-recordings and 
     statistically analyzed. Results.PWS stuttered on words in varying 
     amounts and in significantly larger amounts on nonwords. Stutter 
     frequency increased roughly in proportion to the increase in the 
     length of phonological words (previously known) and nonwords 
     (reported for the first time here). Conclusion. The results cannot be 
     attributed to the difficulty of pronouncing nonwords because Kannada 
     orthography has a one-to-one relationship between the written and 
     spoken forms of words. Speech production is a multi-stage process 
     consisting of ideation, lemma selection, phonological word creation, 
     and the articulatory planning and execution. Because nonwords lack 
     meaning and clearly identifiable part of speech, it appears that 
     stutters arise late in the speech production process at the 
     phonological word formation and articulatory planning stages. 
     Meaning, lexicality, and morphosyntax may not contribute 
     significantly to the occurrence of stutters.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. This study investigated the treatment 
     practices of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) with preschool 
     children who stutter to explore variations in service delivery and, 
     consequently to better inform and support evidence-based practice. 
     Method. 121 Norwegian SLPs completed an online survey about 
     stuttering treatment for preschool children aged up to six years. 
     They reported on treatment training, choices, setting, dosage, and 
     outcomes. Data was analysed descriptively. Correlation analyses 
     between years of clinical experience and clinician perceived outcomes 
     were conducted. Result. Sixty-eight percent of SLPs were trained in 
     one or more stuttering treatment programs. The majority of SLPs (83 
     %) provided treatment in person in preschool centers; 59 % reported 
     providing treatment once a week. Thirty-four percent of SLPs reported 
     that they often or always delivered the whole treatment program. 
     Treatment practice addressed various elements, including advising 
     parents about language and communication strategies, supporting the 
     child's self-image, and perceived outcomes. The SLPs reported their 
     clinician perceived outcomes as 'always' or 'often' reduction of 
     audible stuttering (70 %), reduced cognitive and emotional reactions 
     (55 %), and improved communication skills (58 %). Factors influencing 
     treatment choices were identified at the systemic level (e.g. work 
     place regulations) and individual level (e.g. SLPs competency, 
     child's best). Conclusion. Stuttering treatment services in Norway 
     differ from those reported in existing literature as treatment is 
     given in preschool settings, only 34 % of SLPs deliver programs as 
     intended whilst the majority use treatment elements only, and still 
     experience positive changes. Provision is variable, and seems 
     influenced by SLP training and competence.]

     AB: Abstract. Background and purpose. Developmental stuttering and 
     Tourette syndrome (TS) are common neurodevelopmental disorders. 
     Although disfluencies may co-occur in TS, their type and frequency do 
     not always represent pure stuttering. Conversely, core symptoms of 
     stuttering may be accompanied by physical concomitants (PCs) that can 
     be confused for tics. This scoping review aimed to explore the 
     similarities and differences between stuttering and tics in terms of 
     epidemiology, comorbidities, phenomenology, evolution, 
     physiopathology, and treatment. We also described the nature of PCs 
     in stuttering and disfluencies in TS. Methods. A literature search on 
     Medline, Embase and PsycInfo was executed in March 2022. From 426 
     studies screened, 122 were included in the review (a majority being 
     narrative reviews and case reports). Results. TS and stuttering have 
     several epidemiological, phenomenological, comorbidity, and 
     management similarities suggesting shared risk factors and 
     physiopathology (involving the basal ganglia and their connections 
     with speech and motor control cortical regions). PCs in stuttering 
     commonly involve the face (eyelids, jaw/mouth/lip movements) and 
     sometimes the head, trunk and limbs. PCs can be present from early 
     stages of stuttering and vary over time and within individuals. The 
     function of PCs is unknown. Some individuals with TS have a distinct 
     disfluency pattern, composed of a majority of typical disfluencies 
     (mostly between-word disfluencies), and a mix of cluttering-like 
     behaviors, complex phonic tics (e.g. speech-blocking tics, echolalia, 
     palilalia), and rarely, atypical disfluencies. Conclusion. Future 
     investigations are warranted to better understand the complex 
     relationships between tics and stuttering and address the management 
     of disfluencies in TS and PCs in stuttering.]

     AB: Abstract. The experience of stuttering is wide ranging and 
     includes a variety of perceived and unperceived behaviors and 
     experiences. One of those experiences is anticipation of stuttering. 
     While anticipation of stuttering is commonly discussed in terms of 
     being a prediction of an upcoming event, it has also been equated to 
     an internal realization of stuttering - which is the 
     conceptualization applied here. The aim of this paper is to impress 
     upon the reader that anticipated moments of stuttering (whether at a 
     conscious or subconscious level) must be met with an adaptive 
     reaction or response (which may also occur consciously or 
     subconsciously). While these adaptive reactions and responses may 
     differ based on whether they promote positive or negative 
     communicative behaviors, they still represent adaptations by the 
     speaker. Among the broad category of reactions and responses to 
     anticipation of stuttering are motoric adaptations to speech, which 
     include characteristic stuttering behaviors and other adaptations 
     that may contribute to speech that is perceived by listeners as 
     fluent. An outcome of this conceptualization is, even when 
     adaptations result in listener perceived fluency, the speech of the 
     person who stutters is still controlled by stuttering - meaning that 
     some observable or unobservable adaptation is required. It is 
     critical that speech-language pathologists recognize that the 
     behaviors of people who stutter may reflect reactions and responses 
     to an internal realization of stuttering and observable and 
     unobservable reactions and responses must be considered in both 
     assessments and interventions.]

     AB: Abstract. Assessing a patient's musculoskeletal function during 
     over-ground walking is a primary objective in post-stroke 
     rehabilitation, due to the importance of walking recovery for 
     everyday life. However, the quantitative assessment of 
     musculoskeletal function currently requires lab-constrained 
     equipment, and labor-intensive analyses, which hampers assessment in 
     standard clinical settings. The development of fully wearable systems 
     for the online estimation of muscle-tendon forces and resulting joint 
     torque would aid clinical assessment of motor recovery, it would 
     enhance the detection of neuro-muscular anomalies and it would 
     consequently enable highly personalized treatments. Here, we present 
     a wearable technology that combines (1) a soft garment for the human 
     leg sensorized with 64 flexible and dry electromyography (EMG) 
     electrodes, (2) a generalized and automated algorithm for the 
     localization of leg muscle sites, and (3) an EMG-driven 
     musculoskeletal modeling framework for the estimation of ankle 
     dorsi-plantar flexion torques. Our results showed that the automated 
     clustering algorithm could detect muscle locations in both healthy 
     and post-stroke individuals. The estimated muscle-specific EMG 
     envelopes could be used to drive forward person-specific 
     musculoskeletal models and estimate resulting joint torques 
     accurately across all healthy and post-stroke individuals and across 
     different walking speeds (R2 > 0.82 and RMSD < 0.16). The technology 
     we proposed opens new avenues for automated muscle localization and 
     quantitative musculoskeletal function assessment during gait in both 
     healthy and neurologically impaired individuals.]

     undergone ACL reconstruction and 28 uninjured athletes, matched for 
     age, sex, and sport. All athletes completed a double-leg drop

     CINAHL. Methodological quality and certainty of evidence were 
     evaluated with the PEDro and Grading of Recommendations Assessment,

     of aerobic exercise on functioning were assessed using meta-analytic

     Analysis of the methodological quality of the studies revealed a low 
     risk of bias. The effect of aerobic exercise compared to usual care 
     or other interventions was significant for aerobic capacity 
     (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval

     (SMD = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.10-1.39; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%). Aerobic exercise 
     was not effective for muscle strength, spasticity, gait parameters,

     AB: Abstract. Aim. To gain insight into the perceived emotional 
     impact of providing palliative care among nursing assistants in Dutch 
     nursing homes, their strategies in coping with this impact and 
     associated needs. Design. Exploratory qualitative study. Methods. In 
     2022, 17 semistructured interviews with nursing assistants working in 
     Dutch nursing homes were conducted. Participants were recruited via 
     personal networks and social media. Interviews were open-coded by 
     three independent researchers following the thematic analysis 
     approach. Results. Three themes emerged regarding the elements that 
     contribute to the emotional impact of providing palliative care in 
     nursing homes: impactful situations (e.g. witnessing suffering and 
     sudden deaths), interactions (e.g. close relationship and receiving 
     gratitude) and reflection on provided care (e.g. feeling fulfilment 
     or feeling inadequate in caring). Nursing assistants used different 
     strategies to cope, including emotional processing activities, their 
     attitude towards death and work and gaining experience. Participants 
     experienced a need for more education in palliative care and 
     organized peer group meetings. Conclusion. Elements that play a role 
     in how the emotional impact of providing palliative care is perceived 
     by nursing assistants can have a positive or negative impact.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. It is assumed that people with multiple 
     sclerosis (MS) who participate in programs of physical exercise 
     improve their physical fitness. Objective. The aim of this network 
     meta-analysis (NMA) was to analyze the effect of different types of 
     exercise on muscular fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) 
     among people with MS and to determine the best type of exercise 
     according to disease severity. Methods. MEDLINE, the Physiotherapy 
     Evidence Database, the Cochrane Library, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, and Web 
     of Science were searched from inception to April 2022 to identify 
     randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the effect of physical 
     exercise on fitness in people with MS. We ranked the types of 
     physical exercise by calculating the surface under the cumulative 
     ranking (SUCRA). Results. We included 72 RCTs involving 2543 MS 
     patients in this NMA. A ranking of five types of physical exercise 
     (aerobic, resistance, combined [aerobic and resistance], sensorimotor 
     training, and mind-body exercises) was achieved. Combined and 
     resistance training had the highest effect sizes (0.94, 95% CI 0.47, 
     1.41, and 0.93, 95% CI 0.57, 1.29, respectively) and the highest 
     SUCRA (86.2% and 87.0%, respectively) for muscular fitness. The 
     highest effect size (0.66, 95% CI 0.34, 0.99) and SUCRA (86.9%) for 
     CRF was for aerobic exercise. Conclusions. Combined and resistance 
     training seem to be the most effective exercises to improve muscular 
     fitness and aerobic exercise for CRF in people with MS.]

     times per week for 8 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention comparisons 
     were performed on caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview Scale) and 
     self-compassion (Neff Self-Compassion Scale). Results indicated that 
     the intervention was feasible and acceptable with slight 
     modifications, including (a) leveraging social networks to increase 
     the scope of recruitment efforts nationally and increase the size and 
     diversity of the sample, (b) adding an activity log to better

     health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of older adult survivors of 
     breast cancer (BC) diagnosed in different time periods and to gain 
     insight into whether advances in BC treatment have improved HRQOL. 
     Sample & Setting: Three cohorts of older adult survivors of BC 
     diagnosed before 1995, from 1996 to 2005, and from 2006 to 2015 were 
     examined using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
     Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey linked databases. Methods & 
     Variables: HRQOL was measured using the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health 
     Survey. Mean cohort HRQOL scores were compared using analysis of 
     variance, then multivariate regression models were used to examine 
     the effects of cohort membership and covariates on mental and 
     physical HRQOL. Results: Adjusted mean HRQOL scores trended 
     significantly lower with each successive cohort. Higher comorbidity 
     count and increased functional limitations were negatively associated 
     with HRQOL, and income, education level, and better general health 
     perceptions were positively associated with HRQOL. Implications for 
     Nursing: Regardless of time since diagnosis, older survivors of BC 
     are at risk for poor HRQOL and should be regularly assessed. 
     Maximizing HRQOL requires consideration of the survivor's resources, 
     comorbidities, and functional limitations when planning care.]

     changed their construct of health-related quality of life during 
     treatment. Participants & Setting: 14 participants were selected from 
     10 hematology-oncology departments in Denmark. Methodologic Approach: 
     This interview study used a prospective, longitudinal, exploratory 
     design. Semistructured interviews were conducted while participants 
     were undergoing active treatment for multiple myeloma and six months 
     after the baseline interview. Interviews were analyzed using 
     systematic text condensation. Findings: The overall theme at baseline 
     was insecurity, and the overall theme at six months was coping. The 
     following subthemes were also identified based on participants' 
     description of their health-related quality of life: concerns about 
     having a meaningful life, dealing with everyday limitations, and 
     maintaining social networks; adjusting expectations to abilities; 
     expanding social networks; and exploring a meaningful life. 
     Implications for Nursing: Patients' ability to use coping strategies 
     should be considered when screening for rehabilitation needs. During 
     systematic in-depth symptom screening, unmet rehabilitation needs 
     (e.g. physical functioning, fatigue, pain) may become apparent.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Family-systems interventions have been 
     proposed as one way of supporting families of people with an 
     intellectual disability (ID) or who are autistic. This systematic 
     review aimed to summarise what family-systems interventions have been 
     studied with this population, what evidence there is for their 
     effectiveness and families' experiences of the interventions. 
     Methods. The review was preregistered on PROSPERO (CRD42022297516). 
     We searched five electronic databases, identified 6908 records and 
     screened 72 full texts. Study quality was evaluated using the Mixed. 
     Methods: Appraisal Tool, and a narrative synthesis was used. Results. 
     We identified 13 eligible articles with 292 participating families. 
     Most studies reported positive effects of the interventions on 
     wellbeing and family relationships, and families reported positive 
     experiences. However, research quality was poor and there are no any 
     sufficiently powered randomised controlled trials demonstrating 
     family-systems interventions' effectiveness for this population. 
     Conclusions. There is a need for higher-quality research to establish 
     whether family-systems interventions are beneficial for families of 
     people who have an ID or who are autistic.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Despite an increased likelihood of 
     experiencing traumatic events and increased vulnerability, there are 
     only few publications on trauma therapy for persons with intellectual 
     disabilities (IDs). This pilot study for the first time investigates 
     the feasibility and effectiveness of Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) 
     within this target group modified by Plain Language. Methods. A group 
     of n = 10 participants with ID dual diagnoses and another group of n 
     = 5 participants with severe and chronic mental disorders were 
     separately stratified and randomised, then forming together an 
     intervention group (n = 7) and a waiting list control group (n = 8). 
     All participants were treated with NET attuned to their communication 
     abilities by using Plain Language. Primary outcome was the 
     post-traumatic stress measured with the Post-Traumatic Symptom 
     Scale-10 before and after the intervention. In addition, the Adverse 
     Childhood Experience Index was used for diagnostic purposes. Data 
     were analysed using t-test for repeated measures and analysis of 
     covariance. Results. Narrative Exposure Therapy and the randomised 
     controlled trial study proved to be successfully conductible with 
     participants with IDs in a congregated residential service. Although 
     the corresponding effect size was high (partial eta square = 0.188), 
     the between-group difference was not significant (P = 0.12). Analysis 
     of the observational study resulted in a highly significant 
     improvement for participants with IDs (P < 0.001; Hedges' g = 2.36) 
     and in a significant improvement in participants with severe and 
     chronic mental disorders (P < 0.013; Hedges' g = 1.52). Additionally, 
     the participants with IDs show a significantly better reduction of 
     symptom burden (P = 0.03; partial eta square = 0.327). Conclusions. 
     The results provide a first evidence for a possible and successful 
     implementation of NET modified in Plain Language for persons with IDs 
     and complex mental health support needs. Completeness in responding 
     to the items of Post-Traumatic Symptom Scale-10 and Adverse Childhood 
     Experience Index indicates the suitability of these instruments for 
     both groups of participants. Although the group difference in the 
     randomised controlled trial failed to achieve statistical 
     significance mainly due to the small sample size, the results of the 
     embedded observational study are promising for the conduct of further 
     studies with the modified NET.]

     to investigate the effects of 8-week progressive rope skipping 
     training on physical, cardiovascular fitness and exercise tolerance 
     of high school students with moderate ID. Methods. Thirty-four senior 
     high school with ID (aged 15-18 years old) were randomised into 
     experimental group received progressive skipping rope exercise (RS, n 
     = 17) and control group no rope skipping exercise intervention group 
     (CON, n = 17). The RS group were received progressive rope skipping 
     exercise for 50 min each time, three times a week, for 8 weeks. The 
     control group was not allowed to participate in intervention 
     activities during the study period. The physical fitness, body 
     composition, arterial stiffness index (ASI) and blood pressure were 
     measured before and after the 8-week intervention. Results. After the 
     8-week progressive skipping rope exercise intervention, the 
     participants from the RS group increased in the 3-min step test, 
     sit-up test, grip strength and sit and reach test, when compared to 
     the baseline (P < 0.05). The RS group exhibited lower the area under 
     curve of heart rate (HR) during post-exercise recovery (P < 0.05). 
     The participants in the RS group showed significant decreases in 
     systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, mean arterial 
     pressure (MAP) and HR when compared to the baseline (P < 0.05). 
     Change SBP has moderate positive correlation with change ASI. 
     Conclusions. The results of this experiment suggest that progressive 
     rope skipping exercise might improve physical fitness and promote 
     cardiovascular health, as well as enhance exercise tolerance for 
     adolescent students with moderate ID.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Play is essential for children's 
     development of motor, social-emotional and cognitive skills. 
     Traditional play activities are often difficult for children with 
     complex medical conditions to access, which threatens their ability 
     to maximize their developmental potential. Switch-adapted toys are a 
     common strategy for expanding the play repertoire of children with 
     disabilities by lowering the barrier to play with electronic toys. 
     The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between 
     providing switch-adapted toys to children with disabilities and the 
     children's total and self-initiated play time and access to a variety 
     of cognition-appropriate toys, age-appropriate toys and independently 
     accessible toys as reported by their caregivers. Methods. Caregivers 
     and their children with complex medical conditions were provided 
     switch-adapted toys at a giveaway event. At the giveaway event and 6 
     months later, caregivers completed a survey that included questions 
     about each child's current participation in play and their type of 
     play, child's access to toys and questions specific to switches and 
     switch-adapted toys. Data were analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank 
     tests with a Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control for multiple 
     comparisons. Results. Nineteen caregivers completed both the pre- and 
     post-surveys. The increases in the variety of toys and the number of 
     independently accessibly and cognitively appropriate toys were 
     statistically significant. The change in number of age-appropriate 
     toys and the amount of total and active play time were not 
     statistically significant. Conclusions. Providing switch-adapted toys 
     may be an effective way to increase the number of independently 
     accessible and cognitively appropriate toys for children with complex 
     medical conditions. However, increasing the number of such toys may 
     not be sufficient to increase active and total play time. Further 
     research is needed to identify variables impacting play time and 
     distal outcomes associated with switch-adapted toy access.]

     affecting their mental health and level of participation in academic 
     and nonacademic activities at school and in everyday life. Research 
     shows that perceptual-motor (PM) exercises and physical activities 
     can improve the cognitive and motor skills of typically developing 
     children. To use PM exercises as an intervention in clinical practice 
     for children with learning disorders, or to use it in future 
     research, it seems necessary to discuss and summarize the existing 
     documents in this group of children. Objectives. We aimed to appraise 
     the extent, and the quality of studies about PM interventions for 
     enhancing cognitive, motor, and academic skills in children with 
     learning disorders. Methods. The search was performed according to 
     the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
     Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles published between January 
     2000 and June 2022 were searched in the following scientific 
     databases: PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane library, 
     Science direct, and Google Scholar. The study eligibility criteria 
     were previously established according to the PICOS model. The 
     Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used to assess the 
     methodological quality of the studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration 
     tool (ROB2) was used to assess the risk of bias. Results. The initial 
     search yielded 2160 studies among which 10 studies were 
     systematically reviewed. The total number of participants was 483 
     children (intervention: 251; control: 232). Findings showed 
     significant improvements in cognitive skills (n = 7/8) such as 
     working memory, attention, and information processing speed. In 
     addition, studies showed that PM and physical activity interventions 
     could increase academic performance (n = 4/5) and motor skills (n = 
     5/5) in children with LD. Results regarding the mental health effects 
     of PM exercises (n = 1/3) are few in number and contradicting. 
     Discussion. PM exercises may positively affect cognitive, motor, and 
     academic skills in children with SLD; However, due to the small 
     number of studies, fair methodological quality, and high risk of 
     bias, caution should be taken when interpreting the results.]

     determine the effect of mandala therapy applied to mothers who have 
     children with special needs on the mothers' comfort and resilience 
     levels. Methods. The study was conducted as a randomized controlled 
     study at a special education school in Turkey. The study sample 
     consisted of 51 mothers (24 mothers in the experimental group and 27 
     mothers in the control group) who had children with special needs. A 
     16-h mandala therapy was applied to the mothers in the experimental 
     group. Identifying Information Form, General Comfort Questionnaire 
     and Adult Resilience Scale were used as data collection tools. 
     Results. According to the regression analysis performed in order to 
     explain the difference between the first and third measurements of 
     General Comfort Questionnaire, mandala art therapy was found to be 
     effective, and the model established was determined to be 
     statistically significant. It was also determined that the change 
     that occurred between the third and first measurements performed in 
     order to identify the change in the general comfort levels of the 
     individuals was higher in the experimental group in comparison to the 
     control group (P < 0.05). It was seen that the mothers' mean scores 
     obtained from the Adult Resilience Scale total scale and its 
     subscales significantly increased in the second and third 
     measurements (P < 0.05) but that the increase in the mean scores of 
     the control group was not significant (P > 0.05). Conclusions. 
     Mandala Art Therapy is a method that improves the comfort levels and 
     resilience of mothers who have children with special needs. It might 
     be beneficial for mothers to perform these applications at special 
     education schools in collaboration with nurses.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Older adult Veterans are at high risk for 
     adverse health outcomes following hospitalization. Since physical 
     function is one of the largest potentially modifiable risk factors 
     for adverse health outcomes, our purpose was to determine if 
     progressive, high-intensity resistance training in home health 
     physical therapy (PT) improves physical function in Veterans more 
     than standardized home health PT and to determine if the 
     high-intensity program was comparably safe, defined as having a 
     similar number of adverse events. Methods. We enrolled Veterans and 
     their spouses during an acute hospitalization who were recommended to 
     receive home health care on discharge because of physical 
     deconditioning. We excluded individuals who had contraindications to 
     high-intensity resistance training. A total of 150 participants were 
     randomized 1:1 to either (1) a progressive, high-intensity (PHIT) PT 
     intervention or (2) a standardized PT intervention (comparison 
     group). All participants in both groups were assigned to receive 12 
     visits (3 visits/week over 30 days) in their home. The primary 
     outcome was gait speed at 60 days. Secondary outcomes included 
     adverse events (rehospitalizations, emergency department visits, 
     falls and deaths after 30 and 60-days), gait speed, Modified Physical 
     Performance Test, Timed Up-and-Go, Short Physical Performance 
     Battery, muscle strength, Life-Space Mobility assessment, Veterans 
     RAND 12-item Health Survey, Saint Louis University Mental Status 
     exam, and step counts at 30, 60, 90, 180 days post-randomization. 
     Results. There were no differences between groups in gait speed at 60 
     days, and no significant differences in adverse events between groups 
     at either time point. Similarly, physical performance measures and 
     patient reported outcomes were not different at any time point. 
     Notably, participants in both groups experienced increases in gait 
     speed that met or exceeded established clinically important 
     thresholds. Conclusions. Among older adult Veterans with 
     hospital-associated deconditioning and multimorbidity, high-intensity 
     home health PT was safe and effective in improving physical function, 
     but not found to be more effective than a standardized PT program.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Virtual reality (VR) technology constitutes 
     a promising rehabilitation strategy, but its effect on frailty in 
     older adults remains inconclusive. This study examined the effects of 
     interactive VR training programs on lower-limb muscle strength, 
     walking speed, balance, and fall risks in older adults with frailty. 
     Methods. Various electronic databases comprising PubMed, the 
     Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the 
     Cochrane Library, Embase, the Chinese Electronic Periodical Service, 
     the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and gray literature 
     were searched from their inception through December 31, 2022 for 
     relevant studies. Randomized controlled trials that examined the 
     effects of interactive VR training programs on lower-limb muscle 
     strength, balance, walking speed, and fall risks as measured by 
     validated scales or methods. in older adults aged 65 years and older 
     with frailty were included. A random-effects model was employed to 
     examine the overall effect size, and the trim-and-fill method was 
     adopted to examine publication bias. Results. For those studies that 
     defined frailty using fall risks, substantial evidence demonstrated 
     that interactive VR training interventions increased lower-limb 
     muscle strength (Hedges' g = 0.35, p = 0.015), walking speed (Hedges' 
     g = 0.29, p = 0.003), balance (Hedges' g = 0.62, p = 0.011), and fall 
     risks (Hedges' g = −0.61, p < 0.001). Studies that defined frailty 
     in accordance with the Fried frailty phenotype criteria indicated 
     that interactive VR training interventions only increased walking 
     speed (Hedges' g = 0.28, p = 0.023) and balance (Hedges' g = 0.27, p 
     = 0.049). Conclusions. Interactive VR training programs may benefit 
     older adults with frailty with respect to walking speed and balance. 
     More studies with good study quality are required to validate the 
     effects of interactive VR exercise training on these frailty-related 
     parameters in older adults.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. To systematically review the effectiveness of 
     wheeled mobility interventions in children and young people with 
     cerebral palsy (CP). Method. A systematic literature search was 
     performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
     Trials, EBSCO, PEDro, and Web of Science using database-specific 
     concepts such as 'child' and 'wheelchair'. Studies focusing on 
     wheeled mobility skill interventions with participants aged 6 to 21 
     years with CP were included. Results. Twenty studies with 203 
     participants were included. The impact of wheeled mobility skill 
     interventions was assessed on mobility skills (n = 18), activity and 
     participation (n = 10), and quality of life (n = 3). No studies 
     reported effects on stress, fatigue, and motivational aspects. 
     Interventions included power wheelchair skill training (n = 12), 
     computer-based training (n = 5), smart wheelchair training (n = 2), 
     and manual wheelchair training (n = 1), showing positive wheeled 
     mobility intervention effects. Study quality based on the 
     Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies scale was 9 out of 16 
     and 14 out of 24 for non-comparative and comparative studies 
     respectively. Risk of bias was serious-to-critical on the Risk of 
     Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions. Interpretation. 
     Wheeled mobility interventions showed promising beneficial effects on 
     wheeled mobility, activity and participation, and quality of life for 
     children and young people with CP. Future studies with structured and 
     standardized training programmes and assessment tools are warranted 
     to further accelerate the wheeled mobility skill acquisition process 
     in this population.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. To identify implementation strategies and safety 
     outcomes (adverse events) of community-based physical activity 
     interventions for adolescents and adults with complex cerebral palsy 
     (CP). Method. Five electronic databases were systematically searched 
     to April 2022. Data were extracted on the implementation and safety 
     of physical activity interventions for adolescents and adults with 
     CP, classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) 
     levels IV and V, delivered in a community setting. Results. Seventeen 
     studies with 262 participants (160 participants classified in GMFCS 
     levels IV or V) were included. Community settings included schools (n 
     = 4), participants' homes (n = 3), gymnasia (n = 2), swimming pools 
     (n = 2), and other settings (n = 4). Most studies specified medical 
     or safety exclusion criteria. Implementation strategies included 
     pre-exercise screening, use of adapted equipment, familiarization 
     sessions, supervision, physical assistance, and physiological 
     monitoring. Attendance was high and attrition low. Nine studies 
     reported non-serious, expected, and related events. Four studies 
     reported minor soreness and four studies reported minor fatigue 
     post-exercise. Serious adverse events related to exercise were 
     infrequent (reported for 4 of 160 participants [<2%]: three 
     participants withdrew from an exercise programme and one participant 
     ceased exercise for a short period). Most frequently reported was 
     pain, requiring temporary exercise cessation or programme change, or 
     study withdrawal (three participants). Interpretation. For most 
     adolescents and adults with CP classified in GMFCS levels IV and V, 
     physical activity interventions can be safely performed in a 
     community setting, without post-exercise pain or fatigue, or serious 
     adverse events.]

     AB: Abstract. Rationale. Alternatives to center-based pulmonary 
     rehabilitation are needed to improve patient access to this important 
     therapy. A critical challenge to overcome is how to maximize safety 
     of unsupervised exercise for at-risk patients. We investigated if a 
     novel remote monitoring-enabled mobile health (mHealth) program is 
     safe, feasible, and effective for patients who experience 
     exercise-induced hemoglobin desaturation. Methods. An interstitial 
     lung disease (ILD) commonly associated with pronounced exercise 
     desaturation was investigated - the rare, female-predominant ILD 
     lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Over a 12-week program, hemoglobin 
     saturation (SpO2) was continuously recorded during all home exercise 
     sessions. Intervention effects were assessed with 6-min walk test 
     (6MWT), maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), lower extremity 
     computerized dynamometry, pulmonary function tests, and 
     health-related quality of life (QoL) surveys. Safety was assessed by 
     blood biomarkers of systemic inflammation and cardiac wall stress, 
     and incidence of adverse events. Results. Fifteen LAM patients 
     enrolled and 14 completed the intervention, with high adherence to 
     aerobic (87 ± 15%) and strength (87 ± 12%) training components. An 
     innovative characterization of exercise training SpO2 revealed that 
     while mild-to-moderate desaturation was common during home workouts, 
     participants were able to self-adjust exercise intensity and 
     supplemental oxygen levels to maintain recommended exercise 
     parameters. Significant improvements included 6MWT distance (+36 ± 
     34 m, p = 0.003), CPET time (p = 0.04), muscular endurance (p = 
     0.008), QoL (p = 0.009 to 0.03), and fatigue (p = 0.001 to 0.03). 
     Patient acceptability and satisfaction indicators were high, blood 
     biomarkers remained stable (p > 0.05), and no study-related adverse 
     events occurred. Conclusion. A remote monitoring-enabled home 
     exercise program is a safe, feasible, and effective approach even for 
     patients who experience exercise desaturation.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Activity monitors (apps and wearables) 
     are increasingly used by the general population, including people 
     with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). There is potential 
     for activity monitors to support increases in physical activity for 
     people with COPD and healthcare practitioners (HCPs) are likely to be 
     key in supporting their use, but little is currently known about 
     HCPs' views or experiences. This qualitative research aimed to 
     explore HCPs' views and experiences of supporting people with COPD 
     who have used activity monitors. Methods. Seventeen semi-structured 
     telephone or online interviews were conducted with HCPs between 
     September 2020 and May 2021. HCPs included two nurses, an 
     occupational therapist, a physician, and 13 physiotherapists. 
     Participants were recruited via social media advertisements. They all 
     had experience of supporting people with COPD who had used activity 
     monitors. Interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. 
     Findings. Four themes were developed highlighting the challenges and 
     benefits of HCPs supporting patients with using activity monitors and 
     utilising patient-collected activity data; 1) Skills and experience 
     are needed to increase accessibility and engagement, 2) Objectively 
     monitored physical activity can support exercise prescription, 3) 
     Applications of activity monitors vary across different settings, and 
     4) Support is needed for future use of activity monitors. Discussion. 
     HCPs recognised the potential for activity monitors to impact 
     patients' ability to self-manage their COPD. However, there is a lack 
     of guidance and information to support integration within practice. 
     Future research is needed to co-develop information and guidelines 
     for people with COPD and HCPs.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Chronic respiratory diseases represent a 
     significant burden of disease globally, with high morbidity and 
     mortality. Individuals living with these conditions, as well as their 
     families, face considerable physical, emotional and social 
     challenges. Palliative care might be a valuable approach to address 
     their complex needs, but evidence to prove this is still scarce. 
     Objectives. This systematic review aimed to study the effectiveness 
     of palliative care interventions in health-related outcomes (quality 
     of life, symptom control, symptom burden, psychological well-being, 
     advance care planning, use of health services, and survival) in 
     chronic respiratory patients. Methods. Pubmed, Cochrane and Web of 
     Science were searched for trials published in the last 10 years, 
     comparing palliative care interventions to usual care, in patients 
     with chronic respiratory diseases. The Preferred Reporting Items for 
     Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. 
     Results. Eight studies were included, seven randomized controlled 
     trials and one cluster-controlled trial; the former with moderate 
     risk of bias and the latter with high risk of bias. Findings revealed 
     that palliative interventions improve breathlessness control and 
     advance care planning. There were no significant differences for the 
     other outcomes. Conclusions. Palliative care appears to have a 
     beneficial effect on breathlessness, one of the most distressing 
     symptoms in patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases and 
     allows for advanced care planning. Additional research, with more 
     robust trials, is needed to draw further conclusions about other 
     health-related outcomes.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) cause 
     fibrosis of lung parenchyma, leading to impaired quality of life, 
     dyspnea, and functional decline. Individuals with ILD experience a 
     high prevalence of anxiety and depression. Recent research has 
     demonstrated pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) alleviates symptoms of 
     anxiety and depression in those with COPD. Research question. What is 
     the influence of PR on symptoms of anxiety and depression in 
     individuals with ILD? Study design. We conducted a 
     PRISMA-2020-compliant systematic review of randomized controlled 
     trials (RCTs) investigating PR's effect on anxiety and depression in 
     patients with ILD. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and 
     PsycINFO from inception until April 3, 2023. A narrative synthesis 
     was conducted where a quantitative approach was not feasible. 
     Results. Five RCTs (n = 281) were included. Idiopathic pulmonary 
     fibrosis (IPF) was the most common type of ILD (k = 3). One study 
     reported clinically-significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety 
     among patients with IPF, and two studies for symptoms of depression 
     among patients with sarcoidosis. Dropout rates were similar between 
     intervention and control groups. All studies were at a high risk of 
     bias. Interpretation. Pulmonary rehabilitation is not detrimental to 
     anxiety or depression for patients with ILD, and may improve symptoms 
     of anxiety in IPF and depression in sarcoidosis. However, no 
     conclusion can be drawn from available evidence, which is limited by 
     heterogeneous populations/interventions, sample sizes and 
     unexpectedly low prevalences of clinically-significant anxiety or 
     depression. Further adequately powered RCTs that focus on anxiety and 
     depressive symptoms as primary outcomes are needed.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Physical activity (PA) is low in patients 
     with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Identifying 
     modifiable and non-modifiable correlates of PA give understanding of 
     the individual behavior and provide future directions for PA 
     enhancing interventions. As PA is complex and multidimensional, it 
     should be embedded within a thorough framework. Objective. To 
     identify correlates of PA in a comprehensive COPD population based on 
     a broad ecological model, including physiological, psychological, 
     socio-demographic and environmental dimensions. Methods. PA was 
     objectively measured using the Dynaport Movemonitor and a 
     comprehensive data collection of physiological, psychological, 
     socio-demographic and environmental factors were collected. 
     Bivariable and multivariable regression analyses (including principle 
     component analysis) were executed. Results. For this cross-sectional 
     analysis, we included 148 patients with COPD and valid PA data (mean 
     (SD) age 68 (7) years, FEV1 57 (17) % predicted, 5613 (3596) steps 
     per day). Significant bivariable associations were found for 
     physiological (exercise capacity, muscle force, lung function, 
     symptoms, comorbidities), psychological (e.g. fatigue, motivation, 
     perceived difficulty with PA), socio-demographic (dog owning, use of 
     activity tracker) and environmental (season, daylight, temperature) 
     factors. Based on the multivariable regression model, exercise 
     capacity, beliefs on motivation, importance and self-confidence 
     regarding PA and weather conditions were independent correlates of 
     mean steps per day (R2 = 0.35). Movement intensity during walking was 
     only independently associated with exercise capacity and age (R2 = 
     0.41). Conclusion. Although a wide range of potential influence 
     factors were evaluated, variance in PA was only partly explained, 
     supporting that PA is a complex behavior which is difficult to 
     predict.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction and objectives. This systematic review 
     summarized the evidence on the effects (benefits and harms) of 
     pulmonary rehabilitation for individuals with acute exacerbations of 
     chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Material and methods. 
     We included randomized controlled trials comparing pulmonary 
     rehabilitation to either active interventions or usual care 
     regardless of setting. In March 2022, we searched MEDLINE, Scopus, 
     CENTRAL, CINAHL and Web of Sciences, and trial registries. Record 
     screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were 
     undertaken by two reviewers. We assessed the certainty of the 
     evidence using the GRADE approach. Results. This systematic review 
     included 18 studies (n = 1465), involving a combination of mixed 
     settings (8 studies), inpatient settings (8 studies), and outpatient 
     settings (2 studies). The studies were at high risk of performance, 
     detection, and reporting biases. Compared to usual care, pulmonary 
     rehabilitation probably improves AECOPD-related hospital readmissions 
     (relative risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.86; moderate certainty 
     evidence) and cardiovascular submaximal capacity (standardized mean 
     difference 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.99; moderate certainty evidence). 
     Low certainty evidence suggests that pulmonary rehabilitation may be 
     beneficial on re-exacerbations, dyspnoea, and impact of disease. The 
     evidence regarding the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on 
     health-related quality of life and mortality is very uncertain (very 
     low certainty evidence). Conclusion. Our results indicate that 
     pulmonary rehabilitation may be an effective treatment option for 
     individuals with AECOPD, irrespective of setting. Our certainty in 
     this evidence base was limited due to small studies, heterogeneous 
     rehabilitation programs, numerous methodological weaknesses, and a 
     poor reporting of findings that were inconsistent with each other. 
     Trialists should adhere to the latest reporting standards to 
     strengthen this body of evidence.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, 
     dyspnoea, and fatigue are frequent complications in symptomatic 
     sarcoidosis patients. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise 
     capacity, symptoms, and quality of life in patients with chronic 
     respiratory diseases. Our objective was to systematically determine 
     the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with sarcoidosis. 
     Methods. A systematic review was conducted in seven databases. 
     Studies that applied pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with 
     sarcoidosis were reviewed. Two independent reviewers analysed the 
     studies, extracted the data and assessed the quality of evidence. 
     Results. Of the 406 reports returned by the initial search, five 
     articles reporting on 184 patients were included in the data 
     synthesis. Two studies included multi-component exercise, one 
     inspiratory muscle training, one a physical activity incentivisation 
     programme, and one a telerehabilitation program. In the intervention 
     group (IG), we found significant improvement in exercise capacity 
     (SMD 1.65, 95%CI 0.45, 2.86 points, p = 0.006). If we only analyse 
     the studies that performed the 6-min walking test, the IG walked 40.3 
     (CI95% 20.3, 60.2) m higher than the control group (CG) (p < 0.001). 
     Additionally, dyspnoea score was reduced (MD -0.42 95%CI -0.75, 
     −0.10, p = 0.002). However, fatigue, quality of life and pulmonary 
     function did not show any change. Conclusion. Pulmonary 
     rehabilitation could improve exercise capacity and dyspnoea 
     perception in patients with sarcoidosis.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Geriatric training is designed to prepare 
     physicians to meet the complex needs of older adults, including 
     persons with dementia at the end-of-life (EOL) stage. We sought to 
     compare patterns of EOL care delivered to persons with dementia 
     between physicians with versus without geriatric training. Methods. 
     We conducted a cross-sectional study of a 20% random sample of 
     fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with dementia who died in 
     2016-2018 (n = 99,631). We attributed beneficiaries to a physician 
     who had the largest number of primary care visits during the last 6 
     months of life and determined whether the physician was trained in 
     geriatrics. Our outcome measures included: (i) advance care planning 
     (ACP) and palliative care (e.g. ACP, hospice enrollment in the last 
     90 days of life), and (ii) high-intensity EOL care (e.g. emergency 
     department visits or hospital admissions in the last 30 days of 
     life). Results. Beneficiaries with dementia under the care of 
     physicians with geriatric training had a higher proportion of ACP 
     (adjusted proportion, 15.8% vs. 13.0%; p < 0.001 after accounting for 
     multiple comparisons), palliative care counseling (22.4% vs. 20.9%; p 
     = 0.01), and hospice enrollment (63.7% vs. 60.6%; p < 0.001). 
     Geriatric training was also associated with a lower proportion of 
     emergency department visits (55.1% vs. 59.1%; p < 0.001), hospital 
     admissions (48.8% vs. 52.3%; p < 0.001), ICU admissions (24.9% vs. 
     27.4%; p < 0.001), use of mechanical ventilation (11.2% vs. 13.0%; p 
     < 0.001), and use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (2.1% vs. 2.4%; p 
     = 0.03) in the last 30 days of life. There was no evidence that the 
     placement of feeding tubes differed between the two groups. 
     Conclusions. Physicians' geriatric training was associated with the 
     receipt of more ACP and palliative care and less intensive EOL care 
     among persons with dementia. Provision of geriatric training for 
     physicians may have the potential to improve the quality of EOL care 
     delivered to persons with dementia.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Examine the relationship between balance 
     test performance and the energetic cost of walking (ECW) and gait 
     speed. Methods. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of data 
     from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Men (48%) and women 
     aged 60-96 years enrolled in the BLSA between 2007 and 2020 (n = 
     1132). Balance was assessed using narrow walk (NW) and progressive 
     standing balance tests (SB). ECW measured during 2.5-min usual paced 
     walk while participants wore a portable indirect calorimeter. Gait 
     speed assessed over 6-m. Each test parameterized using validated 
     methods. Statistical analysis to compare balance measures to ECW, and 
     gait speed used generalized logistic regression models and 
     adjustments for age, sex, race, height, weight, and comorbidities. 
     Results. Cross-sectionally, mean ECW was higher and gait speed slower 
     in persons who failed the NW than those who passed (0.189 vs. 0.164 
     mL/kg/m, p < 0.0001 and 0.96 vs. 1.15 m/s, p < 0.0001, respectively). 
     Mean ECW was increasingly higher and gait speed slower over three 
     progressively challenging SB tests (0.207 vs. 0.171 vs. 0.164 
     mL/kg/m, p < 0.0001 and 0.95 vs. 1.05 vs. 1.15 m/s, p < 0.0001). Over 
     an average 2.4 years, those who declined in SB and NW had a higher 
     ECW and slower gait speed than persons who maintained performance 
     (SB: 0.18 vs. 0.160 mL/kg/m, p = 0.0003, and 1.00 vs. 1.13 m/s, p = 
     <0.001; NW: 0.175 vs. 0.160 mL/kg/m, p = 0.002, and 1.04 vs. 1.14 
     m/s, p = 0.001). Persons who improved had lower ECW and faster gait 
     speed than those who failed at both visits (SB: 0.169 vs. 0.240 
     mL/kg/m, p = 0.0002, and 0.99 vs. 0.94 m/s, p = 0.67, NW: 0.163 vs. 
     0.195 mL/kg/m, p = 0.0005, and 1.10 vs. 0.92 m/s, p < 0.001). 
     Conclusion. Instability contributes to higher ECW and slower gait 
     speed which suggests that rehabilitation efforts to improve balance 
     may help maintain function further into older adulthood and delay 
     mobility limitation.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Studies examining end-of-life (EOL) care in 
     older cancer patients are scarce, and prior studies have not 
     accounted for gradients of cognitive impairment (COG-I). We examine 
     EOL care patterns across COG-I gradients, hypothesizing that greater 
     COG-I severity is associated with lower odds of receiving aggressive 
     EOL care. Methods. Using data from the linked Surveillance 
     Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) -Medicare -Minimum Data Set (MDS) 
     3.0, we identified patients with nursing facility stays (NFS) and who 
     died with metastatic cancer from 2013 to 2017. Markers of aggressive 
     EOL care were: cancer-directed treatment, intensive care unit 
     admission, >1 emergency department visit, or >1 hospitalization in 
     the last 30 days of life, hospice enrollment in the last 3 days of 
     life, and in-hospital death. In addition to descriptive analysis, we 
     conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis to evaluate the 
     independent association between COG-I severity and receipt of 
     aggressive EOL care. Results. Of the 40,833 patients in our study 
     population, 49.2% were cognitively intact; 24.4% had mild COG-I; 
     19.7% had moderate COG-I; and 6.7% had severe COG-I. The percent of 
     patients who received aggressive EOL care was 62.6% and 74.2% among 
     those who were cognitively intact and those with severe COG-I, 
     respectively. Compared with cognitively intact patients, those with 
     severe COG-I had 86% higher odds of receiving any type of aggressive 
     EOL care (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.86 (95% confidence interval: 
     1.70-2.04)), which were primarily associated with higher odds of 
     in-hospital death. The odds of in-hospital death associated with 
     severe COG-I were higher among those with short- than with long-term 
     stays (aOR:2.58 (2.35-2.84) and aOR:1.40 (1.17-1.67), respectively). 
     Conclusions. Contrary to our hypothesis, aggressive EOL care in older 
     metastatic cancer patients with NFS was highest among those suffering 
     severe COG-I. These findings can inform the development of 
     interventions to help reduce aggressive EOL care in this patient 
     population.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. To measure the association between cerebral palsy 
     (CP) and non-CP-related movement difficulties and health-related 
     quality of life (HRQoL) among 5-year-old children born extremely 
     preterm (<28 weeks gestational age). Method. We included 5-year-old 
     children from a multi-country, population-based cohort of children 
     born extremely preterm in 2011 to 2012 in 11 European countries (n = 
     1021). Children without CP were classified using the Movement 
     Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition as having significant 
     movement difficulties (≤5th centile of standardized norms) or being 
     at risk of movement difficulties (6th-15th centile). Parents reported 
     on a clinical CP diagnosis and HRQoL using the Pediatric Quality of 
     Life Inventory. Associations were assessed using linear and quantile 
     regressions. Results. Compared to children without movement 
     difficulties, children at risk of movement difficulties, with 
     significant movement difficulties, and CP had lower adjusted HRQoL 
     total scores (β [95% confidence interval] = −5.0 [−7.7 to 
     −2.3], −9.1 [−12.0 to −6.1], and − 26.1 [−31.0 to 
     −21.2]). Quantile regression analyses showed similar decreases in 
     HRQoL for all children with CP, whereas for children with 
     non-CP-related movement difficulties, reductions in HRQoL were more 
     pronounced at lower centiles. Interpretation. CP and non-CP-related 
     movement difficulties were associated with lower HRQoL, even for 
     children with less severe difficulties. Heterogeneous associations 
     for non-CP-related movement difficulties raise questions for research 
     about mitigating and protective factors.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim.To obtain insights into the effects of fatigue on 
     the kinematics, kinetics, and energy cost of walking (ECoW) in 
     children with cerebral palsy (CP). Method. In this prospective 
     observational study, 12 children with CP (mean age 12 years 9 months, 
     SD 2 years 7 months; four females, eight males) and 15 typically 
     developing children (mean age 10 years 8 months, SD 2 years 4 months; 
     seven females, eight males) followed a prolonged intensity-based 
     walking protocol on an instrumented treadmill, combined with gas 
     analysis measurements. The protocol consisted of consecutive stages, 
     including a 6-minute walking exercise (6MW) at comfortable speed, 2 
     minutes of moderate-intensity walking (MIW) (with a heart rate > 70% 
     of its predicted maximal), and 4 minutes walking after MIW. If 
     necessary, the speed and slope were incremented to reach MIW. 
     Outcomes were evaluated at the beginning and end of the 6MW and after 
     MIW. Results. With prolonged walking, Gait Profile Scores 
     deteriorated slightly for both groups (p < 0.01). Knee flexion 
     increased during early stance (p = 0.004) and ankle dorsiflexion 
     increased during late stance (p = 0.034) in children with CP only. 
     Negligible effects were found for kinetics. No demonstrable change in 
     ECoW was found in either group (p = 0.195). Interpretation. Kinematic 
     deviations in children with CP are progressive with prolonged 
     walking. The large variation in adaptations indicates that an 
     individual approach is recommended to investigate the effects of 
     physical fatigue on gait in clinical practice.]

     treatment (LST) in an international context. Method. A questionnaire 
     survey was conducted among 267 neuropediatricians, practicing in 65 
     countries. Comparisons were made according to the Human Development 
     Index (HDI) of the countries. The Idler Index of Religiosity was 
     applied to determine religiosity. Results. Participants from 
     countries with a very high HDI were generally more favorable to 
     limiting LST (p < 0.001), specifically cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
     (p = 0.021), intubation/ventilation (p = 0.014), 
     hemodialysis/hemofiltration (p < 0.001), and antibiotic therapy (p < 
     0.001). Treatment costs that were too high had a weaker influence on 
     their decisions (p < 0.001). Participants who found it never 
     ethically justifiable to limit LST had a higher mean Idler Index of 
     private (p = 0.001) and general (p = 0.020) religiosity and were less 
     satisfied with treatment decisions (p < 0.001) and the communication 
     during the process (p = 0.016). Interpretation. The perspectives 
     towards limiting LST for pediatric patients with UWS are markedly 
     different between physicians from countries with very high and lower 
     HDIs.]

     Standardised outcome measures showed an increase in psychological 
     well-being and self-compassion for all participants postintervention. 
     Two participants showed an increase in psychological distress, while 
     two participants reported decreases in this area. Scores on measures 
     of self-criticism fell for two participants, increased for one 
     participant and showed no change for one participant. Qualitative

     AB: Abstract. Background. Residential transitions have long been 
     recognised as challenging for people with learning disabilities and 
     can be packed with problem stories. Narrative Therapy practices have 
     the potential to centre the voice of people with learning 
     disabilities; to enable alternative stories to be told; and to shine 
     a light on their own and their support system's resources for change. 
     Methods. Colin, a 36-year-old man with Down syndrome and a learning 
     disability, met with the first author for nine sessions. Narrative 
     Therapy practices (also drawing on systemic ideas) were used, 
     including the Tree of Life, Outsider Witness Practice, Therapeutic 
     Documentation and Definitional Ceremony. Feedback from Colin and the 
     staff team was gathered through qualitative and quantitative means. 
     Findings. Colin was keen to share his life stories and explored ideas 
     about his "new life", wanting to "stay strong" and "stay happy". 
     Staff noted an improvement in household stress and perceived ability 
     to support Colin. An improvement in quality of life was also 
     demonstrated with a self-report questionnaire. Conclusions. By 
     acknowledging the power of language, narrative practices offer tools 
     to help people with learning disabilities and their support system in 
     making sense of and navigating important life transitions.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) 
     are attacks that often look like epileptic seizures (ES). Unlike ES, 
     PNES are not triggered by underlying neurological factors. PNES are 
     relatively rare in the general population; however, their prevalence 
     in people with learning disabilities is much higher-up to 10%. 
     Individuals with PNES and learning disabilities often have 
     psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety disorders, depression and 
     posttraumatic stress disorder. There are currently no treatment 
     guidelines for PNES in people with or without learning disabilities. 
     However, talking therapies, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy 
     (CBT), are recommended. This study explores the effectiveness of CBT 
     for the treatment of PNES in a woman (Susan) with PNES and learning 
     disabilities. Methods. We used a single-case experimental design 
     (SCED) to investigate the effectiveness of CBT intervention. 
     Specifically, the withdrawal (also known as ABA) design was applied. 
     The patient's average PNES frequency, as well as idiosyncratic mood 
     measure and standardised outcome measures for people with learning 
     disabilities (Glasgow Anxiety Scale for People with an Intellectual 
     Disability and Mini-Maslow Assessment of Needs Scale-Learning 
     Disabilities), were used to assess the effectiveness of treatment. 
     Findings. Results show that Susan's monthly PNES frequency reduced 
     from phase A1 (assessment phase) to phase B (treatment phase), and 
     this persisted to the follow-up phase (phase A2). However, the 
     reduction was not statistically significant. The intervention was 
     associated with improvements in Susan's mood, anxiety and quality of 
     life. Reduction of Susan's anxiety was clinically significant. 
     Conclusions. This SCED study demonstrates that CBT might be 
     associated with reduction of PNES frequency and improvements in 
     general functioning in people with PNES and learning disabilities; 
     however, further research, especially around confounding variables is 
     needed.]

     AB: Abstract. Current theories of nonword repetition (NWR) 
     impairments for children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) 
     are developed predominantly using data from Indo-European languages. 
     Seldom have relevant theories been attested to the morph-syllabic 
     language Mandarin Chinese. The present research aimed to explore the 
     locus of NWR impairments for Mandarin children with DLD. 80 
     Mandarin-speaking children with typical development (TD) and 80 
     children with DLD were compared on nonword repetition accuracy and 
     error types. It was a three-factor design with language groups 
     (children with DLD vs. TD children) as the between-subjects factor, 
     and components (onset, rhyme, and tone) and syllable numbers (one to 
     four syllables) as the within-subjects factors. The analysis showed 
     that both groups had less accuracy on the two phonological segments 
     (onset and rhyme) relative to tone and showed more errors in 
     multi-syllable nonwords. Children with DLD exhibited more noticeable 
     errors in onsets and rhymes, although they did not display similar 
     issues with tones compared to TD children. Repeated measures ANOVAs 
     showed that children with DLD had pronounced errors in onsets, 
     especially in repeating multi-syllable nonwords. Error type analysis 
     revealed that children with DLD displayed more multiple than single 
     errors in nonword repetition. The results support the 
     "segment-to-frame association" theory, suggesting that Mandarin 
     children with DLD are constrained in the concurrent mapping process 
     between onsets, rhymes, and tones.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. A pilot cluster randomized controlled trial was 
     performed to evaluate the effects of a music group intervention and a 
     leisure activities group intervention on well-being, self-esteem, 
     social acceptance, challenging behaviour and three components of 
     executive functions (inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility and 
     visual working memory) of adults with intellectual disabilities (ID). 
     Method. Twenty-nine participants living in four residential 
     facilities for people with ID were randomized into a music or a 
     leisure activities group intervention. Sixteen weekly sessions of one 
     hour were performed with six to eight participants per group. 
     Measurements were carried out at baseline, post-intervention and 11 
     weeks follow- up. Results were analysed with linear mixed models. 
     Results. The leisure activities group intervention improved more than 
     the music group intervention on internalizing behaviour overall and 
     on inhibitory control at post-intervention. However, further analyses 
     showed that this improvement was only significant in one of the two 
     leisure activities facilities. Conclusion. A leisure activities group 
     intervention seems a promising intervention to improve internalizing 
     behaviour and inhibitory control of younger adults with mild ID. 
     Implications for the delivery of leisure activities group 
     interventions and especially music group interventions are 
     discussed.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. To obtain evidence of validity for the 
     URICA-V scale and estimate the psychometric properties of its items 
     based on item response theory (IRT). Method. A total of 658 
     individuals of both sexes over 18 years of age were allocated into 
     two groups: with dysphonia group (WDG) and vocally healthy group 
     (VHG). A digital database was constructed with personal and 
     professional data and item-by-item responses on the URICA-V scale. 
     Subsequently, Cronbach's alpha, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), 
     confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), application of IRT using 
     Samejima's model and ROC curve analysis were used to obtain the 
     cutoff point for the URICA-V scale. Results. A different version of 
     the original URICA-V scale was obtained. Of the 32 items from the 
     original protocol, 25 better explained the instrument and were 
     regrouped into two domains: contemplation and maintenance. It was 
     possible to identify which items generated higher difficulty (b) and 
     discrimination (a) values and which contributed to the presentation 
     of a calculation based on the theta of each participant. The ROC 
     curve was analyzed, and a cutoff point of -0.236 was established; 
     establishing a cutoff point facilitates the decision of which 
     individuals are in a state of readiness for voice treatment. 
     Conclusion. The present study provided evidence that allows us to 
     propose the URICA-Voice validated (URICA-VV) scale within a more 
     contemporary perspective and with a reduced number of items and 
     domains. In addition, a cutoff point was obtained based on IRT to 
     measure, with greater accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, the 
     stage of readiness and to differentiate individuals who have an 
     indication for speech therapy.]

     AB: ABSTRACT. Summary. Benign vocal fold lesions cause dysphonia by 
     preventing vocal fold closure, causing irregular vibration and 
     increasing compensatory muscle tension. Voice therapy delivered in 
     addition to phonosurgery may improve voice and quality of life 
     outcomes but the evidence base is lacking and what constitutes voice 
     therapy for this population is not defined. The purpose of this 
     systematic review is to critically evaluate the evidence for pre and 
     post-operative voice therapy to inform the development of an evidence 
     based intervention. Study Design. Systematic Review. Methods. 
     Electronic databases were searched using key terms including 
     dysphonia, phonosurgery, voice therapy and outcomes. Eligible 
     articles were extracted and reviewed by the authors for risk of bias 
     and for information regarding the content, timing and intensity of 
     any pre and post-operative voice therapy intervention. Results. Of 
     the 432 articles identified, 35 met the inclusion criteria and were 
     included in the review. 5 were RCTs, 2 were individual cohort 
     studies, 1 was a case control study and 26 were case series. There 
     was considerable heterogeneity in participant characteristics. 
     Information was frequently lacking regarding the content timing and 
     intensity of the reported voice therapy intervention, and where 
     present, interventions were highly variable. Conclusion. Reporting in 
     relevant literature is limited in all aspects of content, timing and 
     intensity of intervention. Further intervention development work is 
     required to develop a robust voice therapy treatment intervention for 
     this population, before effectiveness work can commence.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives/Hypothesis. The objectives of this study 
     were to (1) identify optimal clusters of 15 standard acoustic and 
     aerodynamic voice metrics recommended by the American 
     Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) to improve 
     characterization of patients with primary muscle tension dysphonia 
     (pMTD) and (2) identify combinations of these 15 metrics that could 
     differentiate pMTD from other types of voice disorders. Study Design. 
     Retrospective multiparametric Methods. Random forest modeling, 
     independent t-tests, logistic regression, and affinity propagation 
     clustering were implemented on a retrospective dataset of 15 acoustic 
     and aerodynamic metrics. Results. Ten percent of patients seen at the 
     New York University (NYU) Voice Center over two years met the study 
     criteria for pMTD (92 out of 983 patients), with 65 patients with 
     pMTD and 701 of non-pMTD patients with complete data across all 15 
     acoustic and aerodynamic voice metrics. PCA plots and affinity 
     propagation clustering demonstrated substantial overlap between the 
     two groups on these parameters. The highest ranked parameters by 
     level of importance with random forest models-(1) mean airflow during 
     voicing (L/sec), (2) mean SPL during voicing (dB), (3) mean peak air 
     pressure (cmH2O), (4) highest F0 (Hz), and (5) CPP mean vowel 
     (dB)-accounted for only 65% of variance. T-tests showed three of 
     these parameters-(1) CPP mean vowel (dB), (2) highest F0 (Hz), and 
     (3) mean peak air pressure (cmH2O)-were statistically significant; 
     however, the log2-fold change for each parameter was minimal. 
     Conclusion. Computational models and multivariate statistical testing 
     on 15 acoustic and aerodynamic voice metrics were unable to 
     adequately characterize pMTD and determine differences between the 
     two groups (pMTD and non-pMTD). Further validation of these metrics 
     is needed with voice elicitation tasks that target physiological 
     challenges to the vocal system from baseline vocal acoustic and 
     aerodynamic ouput. Future work should also place greater focus on 
     validating metrics of physiological correlates (eg, neuromuscular 
     processes, laryngeal-respiratory kinematics) across the vocal 
     subsystems over traditional vocal output measures (eg, acoustics, 
     aerodynamics) for patients with pMTD.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. Military drill instructors have extreme vocal 
     demands that place them at risk for phonotrauma. Characterization of 
     laryngeal pathology and vibratory characteristics among drill 
     instructors presenting for specialized voice care is lacking.Methods. 
     A retrospective review in a specialized voice clinic over a two-year 
     period was conducted. Patients identified as current drill 
     instructors between the ages of 28-43 with a diagnosis of dysphonia 
     were included. Laryngeal pathology was diagnosed by a fellowship 
     trained laryngologist and vibratory characteristics were evaluated 
     utilizing the Voice-Vibratory Assessment with Laryngeal Imaging 
     (VALI) rating form. All patients were also evaluated by a 
     speech-language pathologist. Patient reported outcome measures were 
     collected along with perceptual voice evaluations utilizing the 
     Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V). Results. 
     Twelve current drill instructors were identified, and all had 
     phonotraumatic lesions. Lesions were categorized as vocal fold 
     hemorrhage (8%), ectasia (25%), unilateral epithelial thickening 
     (33.3%), bilateral epithelial thickening (58.3%), ventricular cyst 
     (8%), polyp (25%), and sulcus vocalis (25%). Vibratory abnormalities 
     were assessed with the VALI rating scale and correlated to CAPE-V 
     perceptual ratings with 83% having reduced mucosal wave, 75% reduced 
     amplitude of lateral excursion, 50% aperiodic vibrations, 50% 
     asymmetric or chasing wave, 58% glottal insufficiency, 100% 
     supraglottic hyperfunction, and an average CAPE-V overall severity of 
     50% with severe perceptual dysphonia. The average Voice Handicap 
     Index (VHI-10) and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) score was 15.5 and 
     14.7, respectively. Conclusion. Phonotraumatic lesions were 
     universally present in drill instructors complaining of hoarseness, 
     suggesting early referral, and intervention may be warranted in this 
     population.]

     AB: SUMMARY. Objective. Patients with ectodermal dysplasia (ED) 
     suffer from an inherited disorder in the development of the 
     ectodermal structures. Besides the main symptoms, i.e. significantly 
     reduced formation/expression of teeth, hair and sweat glands, a 
     decreased saliva production is objectively accounted. In addition to 
     difficulties with chewing/swallowing, ED patients frequently report 
     on the subjective impression of rough and hoarse voices. A 
     correlation between the reduced production of saliva and an 
     affliction of the voice has not yet been investigated objectively for 
     this rare disease. Methods. Following an established measurement 
     protocol, a study has been conducted on 31 patients with ED and 47 
     controls (no ED, healthy voice). Additionally, the vocal fold 
     oscillations were recorded by high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV@4 kHz). 
     The glottal area waveform was determined by segmentation and 
     objective glottal dynamic parameters were calculated. The generated 
     acoustic signal was evaluated by objective and subjective measures. 
     The individual impairment was documented by a standardized 
     questionnaire (VHI). Additionally, the amount of generated saliva was 
     measured for a defined period of time. Results. ED patients displayed 
     a significantly reduced saliva production compared to the control 
     group. Furthermore, the auditory-perceptual evaluation yielded 
     significantly higher ratings for breathiness and hoarseness in the 
     voices of male ED patients compared to male controls. The majority of 
     male ED patients (67%) indicated at least minor impairment in the 
     self-evaluation. Objective acoustic measures like Jitter and Shimmer 
     confirmed the decreased acoustic quality in male ED patients, whereas 
     none of the investigated HSV parameters showed significant 
     differences between the test groups. Statistical analysis did not 
     confirm a statistically significant correlation between reduced voice 
     quality and amount of saliva. Conclusions. An objective impairment of 
     the acoustic outcome was demonstrated for male ED patients. However, 
     the vocal folds dynamics in HSV recordings seem unaffected.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. Laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPR) is a 
     characterized by symptoms different from gastroesophageal reflux 
     disease (GERD). LPR can causes chronic mucosal inflammation which may 
     lead to an increase in cytokine production, and a systemic decrease 
     in antioxidant enzyme levels. Our aim in this study is to evaluate 
     antioxidant enzyme levels in patients with LPR. Methods. Reflux 
     Symptom Index (RSI) questionnaire, extraesophageal symptom 
     questionnaire which is included in RSI and Reflux Finding Score (RFS) 
     evaluation with 70° rigid laryngoscope were performed to patients 
     who applied to the otolaryngology clinic with a typical LPR 
     complaint, and 60 patients who had an RSI score above 13 and an RFS 
     score above 7 were included in the study. Thirty people consisting of 
     healthy volunteers were included in the control group. Antioxidant 
     enzyme SOD, GSH-Px and CAT levels were measured in the blood serum of 
     the patients and compared with the control group. Results obtained 
     from biochemical tests were expressed as mean ± SE. Descriptive 
     statistical methods (mean ± standard error) were used for the 
     independent t test for the control and study group. P < 0.05 was 
     considered statistically significant. Results. In the LPR group, 28 
     (46%) were women, 32 (53%) were men, and age range was 21-60, average 
     age was 36.45 ± 1.147.There was no significant difference between 
     LPR and control group in terms of age, gender and Body Mass Index 
     (BMI). In the LPR group, the lowest score for RSI was 14 and the 
     highest score was 39. The average RSI was 23.67. RFS ranges from 
     8-22. The mean RFS was 13.50. A highly significant statistical 
     correlation was observed between RSI and total RFS (P < 0.001). There 
     was a significant difference between the antioxidant enzyme levels of 
     the control group and the LPR group. Antioxidant enzyme levels of the 
     control group were SOD 274.10 ± 26.836 U / L, GSH-Px 174.20 ± 
     20.699 µU / mL and CAT 42.2898 ± 20.699 KU / L. Antioxidant enzyme 
     level results of the LPR group were SOD 147 ± 14.022 U / L (P < 
     0.01), GSH-Px 88.28 ± 9.113 µU / mL (P < 0.01) and CAT 12.67 ± 
     0.799 KU / L (P < 0.001). The RSI results ranges from 4 to 39 and the 
     RFS from 8 to 22. Antioxidant enzyme levels demonstrated fairly 
     consistent reliability with individual variables from both RFS and 
     RFS. There was also a highly significant statistical correlation 
     between RSI and RFS. Conclusion. We found that the antioxidant 
     enzymes SOD, GPX and catalase enzyme levels were significantly lower 
     in LPR patients. Treatment modalities to reduce oxidative stress (OS) 
     in LPR should be investigated.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Vocal tract discomfort (VTD), dysphonia, 
     and laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) symptoms are complaints frequently 
     reported by amateur singers. There are two aims of this study. The 
     first is to evaluate the prevalence of these symptoms using validated 
     questionnaires. The second is to correlate singing-related variables 
     with the questionnaire responses. Methods. A total of 392 amateur 
     choir singers (ACS) and 514 control subjects completed an online 
     survey divided into four parts: (1) clinical and demographic 
     characteristics, (2) training in singing and singing experience, (3) 
     history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and LPR symptoms, (4) 
     validated questionnaires. Specifically, the reflux symptom index 
     (RSI), the vocal tract discomfort scale (VTDS), and the voice symptom 
     scale (VoiSS) were included to analyze the actual burden related to 
     LPR symptoms, VTD, and dysphonia. Results. ACS demonstrated a 
     healthier lifestyle and a lower prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux 
     disease symptoms in comparison with control subjects. ACS scored 
     significantly higher in VTDS and VoiSS than control subjects, while 
     no differences in the RSI results were found. Significant 
     correlations among the questionnaires' results were demonstrated. 
     Occasional professional singing was the variable influencing VTDS and 
     VoiSS results the most. Conclusion. ACS do not evidently manifest a 
     higher impairment connected to LPR (RSI score), while they do report 
     higher levels of voice (VoiSS score) and vocal tract (VTDS score) 
     impairments, in comparison with control subjects. The relevant 
     correlations among the PRO measures suggest that LPR symptoms, VTD, 
     and dysphonia are related to each other. Given the relevant 
     repercussion on the severity of VTD and dysphonia, providers should 
     specifically ask about occasional professional singing when treating 
     amateur singers.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. The purpose of this study was to the 
     usefulness of a five-variable model predicting perceived voice 
     severity and incorporating acoustic analysis based on cepstral 
     analysis and self-reported questionnaires, for measuring voice 
     recovery after endolaryngeal phonomicrosurgery in patients with vocal 
     fold polyps. Methods. In this study, 72 patients with vocal fold 
     polyps were included. Two voice evaluations, including acoustic 
     analysis, self-reported questionnaires, and auditory perceptual 
     assessments for each patient, were implemented before and after 
     endolaryngeal phonomicrosurgery. Using these evaluations, we compared 
     the mean values of the perceptual evaluation of voice, acoustic 
     analysis parameters, self-reported questionnaires, and the 
     five-variable model estimated severity pre- and post-endolaryngeal 
     phonomicrosurgery. Results. Various parameters related to acoustic 
     analysis, self-reported questionnaires, and auditory perceptual 
     assessments were useful for measuring voice recovery after 
     endolaryngeal phonomicrosurgery. In particular, a five-variable model 
     incorporating spectral/cepstral analyses and self-reported 
     questionnaires was able to effectively track voice changes after 
     endolaryngeal phonomicrosurgery. Conclusion. We verified that most of 
     the variables and the five-variable model were useful for measuring 
     voice recovery in patients with vocal polyps after endolaryngeal 
     phonomicrosurgery.]

     AB: Summary. Purpose. An eclectic voice therapy program includes 
     sequenced and structured set of exercises combining direct and 
     indirect intervention methods. Tailor-made exercise prescription with 
     specific cultural adaptations are needed to provide a holistic change 
     to voice quality.1 This study detailed the construction of an 
     exercise prescription for participants with hyperfunctional voice 
     disorder [HFVD] in the Indian context. Method. The exercise program 
     was developed based on literature related to vocal therapy approaches 
     and delivery methods. Adaptations were introduced to a selected set 
     of exercises. Five voice experts verified the exercises and their 
     prescription for content and feasibility of use in the Indian 
     context. Modification suggested by the experts were included for 
     framing the final version of the exercise program. This structured 
     therapy program was planned for 6 weeks (30 minutes duration/session 
     offered individually twice per week, with a gap of two days between 
     sessions in a week) with the goals to improve voice quality, 
     flexibility, and endurance while speaking. Five participants with 
     HFVD partook in the study for pilot testing. Stroboscopy, perceptual 
     voice analysis, Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI) and Vocal Fatigue 
     Index in Tamil (VFI-T) were used to report the therapy outcomes. 
     Participants' report on the learning process and generalization of 
     the program were documented. Wilcoxon-signed rank test was used to 
     test the pre-post outcome measures. Results.An eclectic voice therapy 
     program, i.e. Comprehensive Voice Habilitation Program [CVHP] was 
     constructed and it included vocal hygiene instructions, warm-up & 
     cool-down, easy onset, resonant voice, and carry over exercises. 
     Participants completed the program in 14-18 sessions (over 7 to 9 
     weeks of therapy). All participants showed significant changes in 
     vocal fold movement patterns, reduction in ventricular 
     hyperadduction, overall grade of voice quality, DSI and VFI-T. 
     Participants reported that pictorial illustrations, feedback, and 
     monitoring sheets were useful in learning the exercises. Conclusion. 
     CVHP showed significant change in the voice-related outcome measures 
     and was a viable program for treating HFVD.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
     the relationship between vocal variability and variability of 
     vocal-articulatory coordination in children. Furthermore, this study 
     examined if this relationship was impacted by pediatric dysphonia. 
     Study Design. Retrospective analysis of speech samples in the Arizona 
     Child Acoustic Database. Methods. Speech samples from children 2-7 
     years of age were selected for analysis. Vocal variability was 
     defined as the coefficient of variation (CoV) of fundamental 
     frequency, taken from the center of sustained vowels. Variability of 
     vocal-articulatory coordination was defined as the CoV of voice onset 
     time (VOT) of voiceless stop consonants. Both objective and 
     subjective measures of dysphonia were completed for each participant. 
     Results. Children had a negative correlation between VOT variability 
     and vocal variability. Further analysis indicated that this 
     relationship was present in children with typical developmental 
     levels of dysphonia but absent for children with moderate to severe 
     dysphonia. Increased dysphonia severity was associated with increased 
     vocal variability. Conclusion. Increased VOT variability was 
     associated with decreased vocal variability in children with 
     dysphonia severities consistent with typical vocal development. 
     However, this relationship was not present in children with moderate 
     to severe dysphonia. This study suggests that future work is needed 
     to examine the relationships between the vocal system and 
     vocal-articulatory coordination in children with and without 
     diagnosed voice disorders.]

     AB: Abstract. Summary. The self-reporting voice-related quality of 
     life (V-RQOL) instrument has been viewed as a modular index of 
     quality of life for speakers using tracheoesophageal, esophageal 
     (ES), or electrolaryngeal speech. However, V-RQOL has never been 
     studied with pneumatic artificial laryngeal (PA) individuals. This 
     study attempted to quantify the self-assessed voice-related 
     performance of PA and ES speakers in Taiwan via the V-RQOL 
     questionnaire, and further to compare the results for PA and ES 
     speakers. Methods. V-RQOL was assessed in 79 PA and 25 ES speakers 
     undergoing total laryngectomy without using tracheoesophageal 
     puncture. Data were collected from members of Taiwan's Association of 
     Laryngectomees. Results. There was no significant difference between 
     PA and ES participants in social-emotional, physical functioning and 
     total scores, suggesting both may consider their quality of life 
     comparable with each other. In ES participants, there was a 
     significant effect of time after total laryngectomy in physical 
     functioning and total scores. Conclusions. PA speakers did not 
     exhibit more dissatisfaction or disability than ES speakers on 10 
     statements in the V-RQOL, but after total laryngectomy the ES have 
     been shown to improve over time. Information on the experience of PA 
     and ES speakers could be used by clinicians to inform patients of 
     potential outcomes, and help them select suitable rehabilitation 
     techniques.]

     AB: Summary. Introduction. The main objective of this study is to 
     estimate the prevalence of persistent dysphonia in hospitalised 
     COVID-19 patients. Methods. Data were collected from those COVID-19 
     patients who, during the months of March to April 2020, were 
     hospitalised in ward or intensive care unit at the University 
     Hospital of Fuenlabrada. Patients with dysphonia prior to SARS-CoV-2 
     were excluded. Informed consent was obtained orally by a telephone 
     call, as well as clinical and epidemiological data. Patients who 
     reported persistent dysphonia were assessed using the Voice Handicap 
     Index 10, the maximum phonation time, the s/z ratio and a 
     fibrolaryngoscope examination. Patients who reported persistent 
     dysphagia were assessed with the Eating Assessment Tool 10. Results. 
     A total of 79 patients were included in the study (48 men and 31 
     women). 10 ICU patients (25%) and 4 ward patients (10,3%) had 
     dysphonia at least 3 months after hospital discharge, but no 
     association was found between ICU admission and the presence of 
     persistent dysphonia (P = 0.139). Persistent dysphonia in patients 
     admitted to the ICU is associated with persistent dysphagia (P = 
     0.002), also the age of patients with persistent dysphonia is 
     significantly higher than the age of non-dysphonic patients (P = 
     0.046). The most frequent exploratory finding was vocal cord 
     paresis/paralysis (60.4%). Conclusion. This is one of the first 
     studies to show that persistence of dysphonia may be a consequence of 
     COVID-19, so further studies are needed to assess the evolution and 
     prognosis of these patients and the possible association of dysphonia 
     with the severity of the disease.]

     AB: Abstract. The increasingly ubiquitous use of smartphones has made 
     distracted walking common, not only on flat ground, but also on 
     stairs. Available information regarding changes in gait performance 
     while walking and using a smartphone in different environments is 
     still lacking. We aimed to investigate the differences in gait 
     behavior and subjective walking confidence while walking up and down 
     stairs and escalators, with and without smartphone use. A field 
     experiment involving 32 female adults was conducted at a subway 
     station. Gait parameters collected included step frequency, 
     acceleration root mean square, step variability, step regularity, and 
     step symmetry. The results showed that walking task, walking 
     environment, and walking direction significantly affected gait 
     performance and walking confidence. Overall, playing games or texting 
     while walking down escalators resulted in the lowest walking 
     confidence and the largest gait performance decrement: slower step 
     frequency; reduced root mean square; decreased step regularity and 
     step symmetry; and increased step variability. Step frequency, step 
     variability, and step regularity significantly correlated with 
     walking confidence. Smartphone use while walking on stairs and 
     escalators significantly affects gait behavior and might increase the 
     risk of falls. Interventions and prevention are needed to increase 
     safety education and hazard warnings for the general population.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. We analyzed the biomechanical response (joint 
     angles, moments, and powers) to running with added leg mass. These 
     data may help guide the design of wearable locomotor assistive 
     devices (i.e. exoskeletons), which are becoming more 
     prevalent.Methods. 15 participants (7 females, 8 males) completed 
     treadmill running trials () normally and with lead mass (300-1350 g) 
     attached to the thigh, shank, or foot, bilaterally. We quantified the 
     lower limb biomechanics combining motion capture and ground reaction 
     force data using standard inverse dynamics analysis. Results. Only 
     moderate kinematic changes occurred in response to the distal added 
     limb mass. Maximum hip flexion and maximum knee flexion angles during 
     swing phase increased by approximately 9% and 6% respectively for 
     each 1 kg added to each foot. However, adding even small masses made 
     dramatic changes to the joint moments and powers, mostly during the 
     swing phase. For example, adding 1 kg to each foot increased maximum 
     joint moments by as much as 40% (knee extension in late swing) and 
     maximum joint power by as much as 50% (hip generation in late swing). 
     Conclusion. Leg joint kinematics were largely conserved in response 
     to adding mass to the legs. Adding mass to the leg distally increased 
     joint power mainly at the knee and hip joints during the swing phase, 
     whereas adding mass proximally mainly affected the ankle joint 
     mechanics during the stance phase. These changes have implications 
     for shoe designs, people who run with added mass on their legs for 
     sport/strength training and for the design of wearable devices.]

     Participant characteristics, load carriage conditions, study 
     protocol, outcome measures and main findings were extracted and 
     qualitatively synthesised. Absolute oxygen uptake and minute 
     ventilation were consistently greater in males but there were limited 
     sex-specific differences when these were expressed relative to 
     physical characteristics. There is limited evidence of sex-specific 
     differences in spatio-temporal variables, ground reaction forces 
     (normalised to body mass) or sagittal plane joint angles with load. 
     However, differences have been found in hip and pelvic motions in the 
     frontal and horizontal planes, which might partly explain an 
     economical advantage for females proposed by some authors.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. To analyse how family members participate in 
     hospital inpatient palliative care, and how their participation could 
     be supported. Methods. This review followed a methodology outlined in 
     the literature for integrative reviews. A literature search 
     supplemented by a manual search was conducted on four electronic 
     databases during 2020 to 2021: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane 
     Library. A critical appraisal of the included studies was performed, 
     and data were analysed using inductive content analysis. Results. The 
     literature search resulted in 4990 articles, of which 14 articles 
     were included in this review. Four main categories were identified 
     concerning the participation of family members in hospital inpatient 
     palliative care: participation in the physical care, provision of 
     emotional support, promoting good patient care, and support provided 
     by healthcare professionals for family members' participation. Family 
     members' participation can be supported in different ways, including 
     active communication and adequate information. Conclusion. Family 
     members' participation in hospital inpatient palliative care has been 
     an important part of palliative care in hospital settings. Family 
     members should be offered the opportunity to participate in patient 
     care, and their presence in the hospital should be accommodated. 
     Research on the topic is still scarce, and future research is needed 
     from different perspectives, including intervention research.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. There is insufficient knowledge available 
     about the impact of paediatric palliative care at home on meeting 
     family needs and ensuring the highest quality of care for the dying 
     child. The aim of this study was to elucidate parents' experiences of 
     how and why home-based paediatric palliative care impacted the entire 
     family during their child's final phase of life. Methods. The study 
     used a qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted 
     with the bereaved parents of children who had received palliative 
     care at home from a paediatric cancer hospital department programme 
     that was based on collaboration with community nurses and the 
     paediatric palliative care service. The interviews were transcribed 
     verbatim, and qualitative content analysis was applied. The 
     Ecocultural theory was used to explain the findings. Results. Three 
     main themes emerged: (1) involvement enabling a sense of control and 
     coping, (2) sustaining participation in everyday family life routines 
     and (3) making room for presence and comfort during and after the 
     end-of-life trajectory. Conclusion. End-of-life palliative care at 
     home can enable parents and other family members to maintain a sense 
     of control, presence and semblance of everyday life. It contributes 
     to managing and alleviating the burden and distress during the last 
     phase of the child's life and during bereavement. We suggest that 
     healthcare professionals support family members in participation and 
     daily life routines and activities during a child's EOL care, as it 
     affects the well-being of the entire family.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Rehabilitation that supports the individual 
     on the journey back to their usual selves after cancer treatment 
     becomes increasingly important. Studies have shown that a focus on 
     the connection between body and mind might be beneficial. 
     Consequently, Whole Person Care and initiatives that fall in line 
     with this holistic approach to health care, such as a dance-like 
     intervention needs further examination. The aim of this study was to 
     explore the qualitative aspects of 5Rhythms® as experienced by 
     people diagnosed with cancer. Method. A total of 29 (17 in 2017) 
     participants were recruited through purposeful sampling. Participants 
     underwent one 5Rhythms® session per week for 2 months. This 
     qualitative study with a phenomenological approach used diaries and 
     individual interviews as its methods for data collection. Data were 
     analysed using Giorgi's phenomenological framework and Maurice 
     Merleau-Ponty's theoretical perspectives on phenomenological 
     approaches to the body, perception and consciousness were applied. 
     Results. Three main themes ('(now) I sense my entire body', 
     'Something liberating is happening inside my body' and 'We travel 
     together') and five connecting sub-themes were identified through the 
     analysis process. Conclusion. Participating in 5Rhythms® contributed 
     to reconnecting body and soul during or after battling cancer. It 
     evoked thoughts and feelings of existential matter. Results suggest 
     that participating in 5Rhythms® can assist in personal growth. The 
     benefit of being among peers while on the path to recovery was also 
     illuminated. In regard to rehabilitation, this study underlines the 
     importance of being aware of the connection between body and mind.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The progressive nature of dementia leaves 
     the person vulnerable and dependent on others for care. While persons 
     with dementia often have better outcomes when cared for at home, it 
     can lead to personal challenges and self-neglect of the caregiver. 
     Mindfulness-based interventions such as yoga can lessen the potential 
     negative effects encountered by caregivers of persons with dementia. 
     Aim. The aim of this review was to synthesise available empirical 
     research related to the role of yoga on the biopsychosocial health 
     outcomes for caregivers of persons with dementia population. Method. 
     A systematic search of the databases Academic Search Complete, CINAHL 
     Plus, Medline and PsychINFO was done using the terms "yoga" AND 
     "caregivers or family members or informal caregivers" AND "dementia 
     or Alzheimer's." Using the selection process outlined by the PRISMA 
     framework, thirty-six studies met the initial criteria and were 
     potentially relevant to the topic. A methodological check was 
     performed using the critical appraisal tool of Melnyk and 
     Fineout-Overholt and the GRADE system of recommendation. This process 
     led to the inclusion of four articles. Findings. Four studies were 
     included for this review: two randomised controlled trials, a 
     non-randomised intervention study with a waitlist and a pilot cohort 
     study. Three studies focused on informal caregivers and one study 
     involved professional caregivers. In all studies, yoga practices 
     included asanas, pranayama, relaxation and meditation. This 
     integrative review recommended that yoga may be useful in reducing 
     stress, depression and anxiety while increasing quality of life 
     indicators, vitality indicators, self-compassion scores, mindfulness 
     attention, sleep quality and diastolic blood pressure. Outcomes that 
     were not significantly changed were caregiver burden, systolic blood 
     pressure and heart rate. However, the level of evidence was moderate 
     with small sample sizes suggesting additional research is needed to

     identified several particular social risk factors (including 
     education status, socioeconomic status, and occupational factors) 
     that are consistently associated with adverse low back pain outcomes. 
     In addition, the analysis of the population-representative

     AB: Tarsal navicular stress fractures are rare injuries, mostly 
     occurring in long-distance runners, jumpers, and occasionally 
     affecting athletes in high-contact sports such as rugby or 
     American/Australian football. This condition generally represents a 
     clinical challenge, resulting in considerable diagnostic delays. 
     While the ideal treatment is still controversial, surgical treatment 
     seems to provide good results in recovering function and return to 
     play. Tarsal navicular stress fractures have been extremely rare in 
     soccer players; only seven published cases have been located to date. 
     This article is a paradigmatic report on a professional player with 
     this injury and a successful outcome after a 12-year follow-up.]

     AB: Abstract. As physical disability exists globally and stigma is 
     prevalent, the need for research on the stigma of physical disability 
     is identified in the fields of rehabilitation and disability studies. 
     This study conducted a scoping review for analyzing the 
     manifestations of stigma on people with physical disabilities using 
     Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
     guidelines. Search terms were used with three electronic databases 
     (Pub-Med, ERIC, and Psyc-INFO) for peer-reviewed rehabilitation and 
     disability journals published from 2000 to 2020 time frame. A total 
     of 683 records were identified, of which 146 were duplication and 413 
     were excluded by title and abstract, and 124 full-text articles were 
     assessed for eligibility. The final number included was 3 
     quantitative studies and 8 qualitative synthesis studies for a total 
     of 11 studies. This study revealed that the stigma related to people 
     with physical disabilities is a global issue, and stigma appeared in 
     various settings of society (e.g. education, workplace, 
     rehabilitation and sexual health care, and the benefit system). 
     Public stigma usually appeared related to physical image and the 
     presence of a wheelchair, and most of the studies related to 
     self-stigma were in the stage of recognizing the public stigma, and 
     there were also responses to the public stigma to aim for 
     opportunities for coping and change. Awareness of stigma led to 
     negative psychosocial well-being such as depression, self-efficacy, 
     and quality of life. Future researchers should consider cultural 
     differences and specific types of physical disabilities.]

     AB: For married couples, adjustment to disability is a process that 
     impacts both spouses. Spousal caregivers often report limited or poor 
     coping strategies and can experience caregiver burden. Due to the 
     shared stress, dyadic coping strategies must be considered in 
     addition to individual coping responses. There is limited research 
     explaining why couples engage in dyadic coping more effectively than 
     others. Love styles are categorizations of love behaviors, thoughts, 
     and motivations. Analyzing Lee's (1957) love styles (Eros, Ludus, 
     Storge, Agape, Mania, and Pragma) may lead to a possible explanation. 
     The relationships between love styles, dyadic coping, and caregiver 
     burden are conceptualized, and recommendations for rehabilitation 
     counselors are provided.]

     2022, were elicited through database search and analyzed by the 
     "VOSwiever" program. The results indicated that the total number of

     publication collaborations between the countries of England, China, 
     Taiwan, South Korea, Turkey, Norway, and the United States. 
     Additionally, the results provided three different clusters for the 
     co-occurrences of the terms in abstracts and titles. The first 
     cluster was related to psychosocial factors; the second cluster was 
     related to vocational rehabilitation and employment; and the third 
     cluster was related to psychometric validation terms. The current 
     study supported exploring and determining hot spots and research gaps 
     in the field of RC. Although the RCB publications were in line with

     of life in children with cancer. However, relationships between 
     parent anxiety and child health-related quality of life (HRQoL) have 
     not been evaluated in children with advanced cancer. Objective: To 
     examine relationships between parent anxiety and both parent-reported 
     and child self-reported HRQoL for children with advanced cancer. 
     Method: Children (aged 5-17 years) with relapsed or refractory cancer 
     and their parents participated in this single-institution 
     cross-sectional study. Parents completed measures of their own 
     baseline anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait [STAI-T] form) 
     and their ill child's HRQoL (PedsQL Generic and PedsQL Cancer, parent 
     report). Children completed age-specific PedsQL Generic and PedsQL 
     Cancer, child report. Spearman's rho coefficients assessed 
     correlations between total parent STAI-T score and both 
     parent-reported and child-reported HRQoL scales. Results: Twenty 
     children (Mage = 9.5 years, 50% female) and their 20 parents (90% 
     mothers) participated. The strongest and statistically significant (p 
     < .05) correlations were inverse associations between parental trait 
     anxiety and parent-reported child psychosocial HRQoL (rs = −.54), 
     emotional functioning (rs = −.49), school functioning (rs = 
     −.45), and child pain and hurt (rs = −.45). Correlations of 
     parental anxiety with all dimensions of child-reported HRQoL were 
     generally smaller (rs < .40), positive, and not statistically 
     significant (p > .05). Discussion: Given the inverse correlations 
     between parental anxiety and child psychosocial HRQoL, assessment of 
     parent mental health needs and access to interventions should be 
     provided routinely for parents of children with advanced cancer.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. The aim of this review was to 
     systematically evaluate the available evidence on the effectiveness 
     of internet-based telerehabilitation among patients after total joint 
     arthroplasty regarding pain, range of motion, physical function, 
     health-related quality of life, satisfaction, and psychological 
     well-being. Methods. This was a systematic review with meta-analysis 
     based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of 
     Interventions guidelines. Studies published in English or Chinese 
     were searched using defined search periods, databases, and search 
     terms. Two reviewers assessed independently the quality of studies. 
     RevMan 5.3 was used for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed 
     using the χ2 and I2 statistic. A random effect model and mean 
     difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was adopted. 
     Standardised mean difference (SMD) was used if the outcome was 
     measured by different scales. Results. Eleven studies with 1020 
     participants were analysed. Compared to face-to-face rehabilitation, 
     internet-based telerehabilitation showed no significant difference in 
     outcomes of pain (SMD-0.11, 95% CI-0.32 to 0.10), range of motion in 
     flexion (MD 0.65, 95% CI-1.18 to 2.48) and extension (MD-0.38, 95% 
     CI-1.16 to 0.40), patient-reported physical function (SMD 0.01, 95% 
     CI-0.15 to 0.17), health-related quality of life (SMD-0.09, 95% 
     CI-0.26 to 0.07), satisfaction (SMD-0.04, 95% CI-0.21 to 0.14), and 
     psychological well-being (SMD 0.10, 95% CI-0.13 to 0.33). 
     Internet-based telerehabilitation showed better outcomes in physical 
     functional tests (SMD-0.54, 95% CI-1.08 to-0.01). Discussion. This 
     review suggests that internet-based telerehabilitation has comparable 
     effectiveness to face-to-face rehabilitation on rehabilitation 
     outcomes among patients after total joint arthroplasty.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains common 
     in endemic regions, causing significant healthcare burden. Patients 
     with CHB may need to be adherent to nucleoside analogue (NA) for a 
     long period of time to prevent complications. This study aims to 
     investigate the safety, efficacy and patient experience of a virtual 
     monitoring clinic (VMC) in monitoring stable patients taking NA for 
     CHB. Methods. Patients on NA and regular follow-up were randomised to 
     either VMC alternating with doctors' clinic visit or to a control 
     group in which they continued standard follow-up by doctors. Therapy 
     adherence was measured by medication possession ratio (MPR) for NA 
     therapy, incidence of virological breakthrough and hepatocellular 
     carcinoma (HCC) development at two years of follow-up. Patient 
     acceptance was measured on a Likert scale of 1-10. Results. A total 
     192 patients completed follow-up: 94 and 98 patients in the VMC and 
     control groups, respectively. Mean age was 60.6 ± 10.8 years, with 
     95.3% Chinese ethnicity and 64.1% males. Age, gender, race, 
     educational, employment and financial status were similar in both 
     groups. Upon study completion, the majority of patients - 76 (80.9%) 
     in VMC group and 74 (75.5%) in control group - had MPR ≥0.8; 88.8% 
     were satisfied and rated VMC better than a traditional follow-up 
     clinic with doctors only. More than 85% of patients rated ≥8/10 on 
     the Likert scale for VMC, and preferred VMC over traditional clinic 
     visits. Clinical outcomes observed were HCC development in one (1.1%) 
     in the VMC group and four (4.1%) in the control group (p = 0.369). 
     Two (2.1%) and one (1.0%) virological breakthroughs were observed in 
     the VMC and control groups, respectively (p = 0.615). No incidence of 
     HCC or abnormal blood tests were missed in the VMC arm. Discussion. 
     VMC is a viable and safe clinical model for monitoring stable CHB 
     patients on NA therapy without compromising patients' adherence to 
     medications and is preferred by patients.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Few studies have reported information 
     related to the cost-effectiveness of traditional face-to-face 
     treatments for aphasia. The emergence and demand for telepractice 
     approaches to aphasia treatment has resulted in an urgent need to 
     understand the costs and cost-benefits of this approach. Methods. 
     Eighteen stroke survivors with aphasia completed community-based 
     aphasia telerehabilitation treatment, utilizing the Language-Oriented 
     Treatment (LOT) delivered via Webex videoconferencing program. 
     Marginal benefits to treatment were calculated as the change in 
     Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R) score pre- and post-treatment 
     and marginal cost of treatment was calculated as the relationship 
     between change in WAB-R aphasia quotient (AQ) and the average cost 
     per treatment. Controlling for demographic variables, Bayesian 
     estimation evaluated the primary contributors to WAB-R change and 
     assessed cost-effectiveness of treatment by aphasia type. Results. 
     Thirteen out of 18 participants experienced significant improvement 
     in WAB-R AQ following telerehabilitation delivered therapy. Compared 
     to anomic aphasia (reference group), those with conduction aphasia 
     had relatively similar levels of improvement whereas those with 
     Broca's aphasia had smaller improvement. Those with global aphasia 
     had the largest improvement. Each one-point of improvement cost 
     between US$89 and US$864 for those who improved (mean = US$200) 
     depending on aphasia type/severity. Discussion. Individuals with 
     severe aphasia may have the greatest gains per unit cost from 
     treatment. Both improvement magnitude and the cost per unit of 
     improvement were driven by aphasia type, severity and race. Economies 
     of scale to aphasia treatment-cost may be minimized by treating a 
     variety of types of aphasia at various levels of severity.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. This research examines utilization 
     patterns for patients using telemedicine compared to those receiving 
     treatment conventionally. Administrative data from 2007-2016 is 
     linked to records from the Manitoba Telehealth programme to conduct a 
     population-level study. Methods. Using a high dimensional 
     propensity-weighted regression model, the study compares four 
     utilization measures between telemedicine users and non-users. These 
     include: ambulatory visits (number of visits to any physician), 
     visits to primary care physicians, visits to specialists and the 
     number of hospitalizations. Results. Compared to non-users, 
     telemedicine patients showed a higher number of in-person visits. 
     Specifically, using incidence-rate ratios, telemedicine users had 
     1.32 more ambulatory visits (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 
     1.23-1.41), 1.26 more visits to primary care practitioners (p<0.001; 
     95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.35), 1.38 more visits to specialists 
     (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.61) and 1.14 more 
     hospitalizations (p>0.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.43). These 
     results were robust to restricted analyses for distance, regions, and 
     chronic conditions. Those patients with frequent virtual encounters 
     with a specialist showed a decrease of the frequency of in-person 
     visits of the same type of care (incidence-rate ratio=0.48, p < 
     0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.54). Discussion. Patterns in 
     utilization vary between telemedicine users and non-users, with users 
     showing a higher number of in-person visits than non-users, and only 
     frequent users of telemedicine showing reduced in-person visits. 
     Future investigation linking utilization patterns with patient care 
     outcomes and costs will inform healthcare policy and clinical 
     treatment plans.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Clinical trials have proven the efficacy 
     of mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients with large-vessel 
     occlusion presenting within 24 hours of symptom onset. Extending the 
     thrombectomy window to 24 hours resulted in a higher number of 
     thrombectomies being performed. However, little is known about the 
     impact of the extended thrombectomy window on the telestroke call 
     burden. Methods. We used the prospectively maintained database of a 
     telestroke network covering a large geographic area in the Southeast 
     USA. We included patients presenting between January 2015 and 
     December 2019. We compared the characteristics and outcomes between 
     patients who presented before and after the publication of the 
     extended window thrombectomy trials. Results. A total of 9041 
     patients presented with stroke-like symptoms during the study period. 
     Of these, 4995 presented after February 2018. There was no difference 
     in the patient demographics in both groups. However, patients in the 
     post extended window group had a lower National Institute of Health 
     Stroke Scale on presentation (3 vs. 4; p < 0.001) and longer 
     symptom-onset-to-door time (124 vs. 85 minutes; p < 0.001). The 
     number of consults per month nearly doubled (200 vs. 103; p < 0.001) 
     in the extended thrombectomy window era. Similarly, the number of 
     mechanical thrombectomies performed per month increased from four to 
     seven since extending the thrombectomy window (p < 0.001). 
     Discussion. The number of telestroke consults nearly doubled after 
     the publication of the extended thrombectomy window trials, with an 
     increase in the number of thrombectomies performed. These findings 
     have important operational implications for hospitals implementing 
     telestroke call coverage.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Telehealth service provision has 
     accelerated during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 
     As the pandemic continues, clinical practices have discovered ways to 
     resume operations. Opportunities exist to understand patient 
     preferences for telehealth clinical services and to tailor offerings 
     to different demographic groups.. Methods. We conducted a survey of 
     patients receiving telehealth services through our outpatient 
     practice to understand the types of healthcare services for which 
     patients report preferences for telehealth. Results. We received 551 
     survey responses (response rate = 20.8%; 551/2650). More than half of 
     patients indicated being 'very likely' to use telehealth services to 
     refill medication(s) (67.3%), prepare for an upcoming visit (66.1%), 
     review test results (60.3%), or receive education (54.2%). Males had 
     lower odds of preferring telehealth services for reviewing test 
     results (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
     0.34-0.94) or mental health issues (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.38-0.77). 
     Respondents who received a video visit were significantly more likely 
     than those who received a telephone visit to report preferences for 
     using telehealth for education, care plan discussions, long-term 
     health issues, and mental health. Discussion. Patient preferences for 
     telehealth services vary by services provided and respondent 
     demographics. Experience with telehealth increases the likelihood for 
     future use of these services.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. On-demand telehealth can have a high rate 
     of patients requesting visits and dropping off without being seen by 
     a provider, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. 
     On-demand telehealth requests made to a large healthcare system in 
     the USA between 15 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were included for 
     analysis with a focus on patients who were defined as left without 
     being seen (LWBS). As part of a pilot program a registered nurse 
     attempted to call LWBS patients within 24 hours of their telehealth 
     request and asked if they were ok, if they sought care for their 
     original visit reason, what that care was, or if they still needed 
     guidance. This information and patient demographics were analyzed. 
     Results. During the study period there were 21,610 completed 
     on-demand telehealth visits and 1852 patients for whom there were 
     LWBS attempted follow-ups. Most patients LWBS for a reason that 
     originated from the patient and not associated with the provider or 
     telehealth platform. The mean wait time for LWBS patients was 12.4 
     min compared to patients waiting 15.1 min before engaging with a 
     provider to complete a visit. Of the 1852 total LWBS patients in the 
     follow-up programme, 819 (44.2%) were successfully contacted with a 
     follow-up phone call. Most of these patients (63.2%) already 
     completed or planned to complete a telehealth visit, 13.6% indicated 
     they no longer needed to see a provider, and 12.8% planned or already 
     completed an in-person visit. Only 2.2% went to an emergency 
     department. Discussion. Results suggest patients can effectively 
     self-manage their care needs.]

     this time of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. However, the 
     differences regarding the training loads and implementation between

     this study was to compare the implementation and training load 
     between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs in 
     individuals with spinal cord injury. Methods. Forty individuals with 
     spinal cord injury were recruited and stratified into tetraplegia and 
     paraplegia groups. All subjects performed 3 weeks of both the 
     synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs, after two weeks 
     of familiarization with the exercises, remote connection tools and 
     methods to record information. The primary outcomes were training 
     load (average daily workload and average and total weekly training 
     load) and implementation (adherence and successful exercise 
     recording). Demographic characteristics were obtained from 
     participants' electronic medical records. Results. Weekly mean 
     workload, total workload, adherence and successful exercise recording 
     presented significantly higher values in the synchronous compared to 
     asynchronous tele-exercises. Average daily workload did not present 
     significant differences between the tele-exercises. Discussion. The 
     training load for each training session presented no differences 
     between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercises. Both adherence 
     and successful data recording showed more favourable implementation 
     values for synchronous training, thus allowing greater weekly 
     training loads (total and average).]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Genome-wide sequencing (exome or whole 
     genome) is transforming the care and management of paediatric 
     patients with a rare disease because of its diagnostic capabilities. 
     Genome-wide sequencing is most effective when both parents and the 
     child are sequenced as a trio. Genetic counselling is recommended for 
     all families considering genome-wide sequencing. Although telehealth 
     is well established in genetic counselling for hereditary cancer and 
     prenatal genetics, its use with genome-wide sequencing has not been 
     well studied. The CAUSES Clinic at BC Children's and Women's 
     Hospitals was a translational paediatric trio-based genome-wide 
     sequencing initiative. Pre-test genetic counselling via telehealth 
     (at a clinical site near the family's residence) was offered to 
     families who had been previously evaluated by a clinical geneticist. 
     We report on the first 300 families seen in the CAUSES clinic and 
     compare health services implementation issues of families seen via 
     telehealth versus on-site. Methods. Demographics, cost to families 
     (travel and time), time to first appointment, complete trio sample 
     accrual and diagnostic rates were studied.. Results. Of the 300 
     patients, 58 (19%) were seen via telehealth and 242 (81%) were seen 
     on-site for pre-test counselling. The mean time to completion of 
     accrual of trio samples in the telehealth group was 56.3 (standard 
     deviation ±87.3) days versus 18.9 (standard deviation ±62.4) days 
     in the onsite group (p < 2.2 × 10−16). The mean per-family 
     estimated actual or potential travel/time cost savings were greater 
     in the telehealth group (Can$987; standard deviation = Can$1151) than 
     for those seen on-site (Can$305; standard deviation = Can$589) (p = 
     0.0004). Conclusions. Telehealth allowed for access to genome-wide 
     sequencing for families in remote communities and for them to avoid 
     significant travel and time costs; however, there was a significant 
     delay to accrual of the complete trio samples in the telehealth 
     group, impacting on time of result reporting and delaying diagnoses 
     for families for whom genome-wide sequencing was diagnostic.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Microglial-induced inflammation plays a 
     crucial role in the pathophysiological process of nervous system 
     injury, however, still lacks effective therapeutic agents. 
     Previously, we discovered that the inhibition of histone deacetylase 
     3 (HDAC3) exerts anti-inflammatory effects after traumatic spinal 
     cord injury (SCI), whereas little is known about its underlying 
     mechanism. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the effects 
     and potential mechanisms of HDAC3 on neuroinflammation and microglial 
     function. Methods. Rats were randomized into 4 groups: sham group, 
     SCI group, SCI + vehicle group, and SCI + RGF966 group. To examine 
     the effect of HDAC3 on neurological deficit after SCI, we gathered 
     data using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotion scale, the inclined 
     plane test, the blood-spinal cord barrier, junction protein 
     expression, and Nissl staining. We also evaluated microglial 
     activation and inflammatory factor levels. Immunofluorescence 
     analysis, immunohistochemical analysis, western blotting, and 
     quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to 
     examine the regulation of the Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/nuclear 
     factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Results. The 
     results showed that HDAC3 inhibition significantly ameliorated 
     Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) permeability, brain edema, and improved 
     neurological functions and junction protein levels. Additionally, 
     HDAC3 inhibition significantly inhibited microglial activation, 
     thereby reducing the levels of SCI-induced pro-inflammatory factors. 
     Moreover, HDAC3 inhibition dramatically enhanced the expression of 
     SIRT1 and increased both Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and 
     transcriptional activity, thereby increasing downstream heme 
     oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 expression. 
     Conclusions. The results of this study suggest that HDAC3 inhibition 
     protects the spinal cord from injury following SCI by inhibiting 
     SCI-induced microglial activation and the subsequent inflammatory 
     response via SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway, highlighting HDAC3 as a 
     potential therapeutic target for the treatment of SCI.]

     individually impacted improvement in picture naming between baseline 
     and 1 week after the end of the therapy, then whether the combination

     interactions were observed between tDCS group and both age and 
     education. The predictors of a positive response to tDCS differed 
     from the predictors of a positive response to language treatment 
     alone. While baseline performance was an important predictor of 
     future performance regardless of treatment group, responses to 
     treatment without tDCS were influenced by age whereas responses to 
     treatment with tDCS were not. Conclusions. Age and education 
     influence the efficacy of different treatment strategies. Refinement 
     of treatment selection is important to the overall individualization 
     and optimization of post-stroke patient care.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Recovery of quiet standing balance early 
     poststroke has been poorly investigated using repeated measurements. 
     Objective. To investigate (1) the time course of steady-state balance 
     in terms of postural stability and inter-limb symmetry, and (2) 
     longitudinal associations with lower limb motor recovery in the first 
     3 months poststroke. Methods. Forty-eight hemiparetic subjects (age: 
     58.9 ± 16.1 years) were evaluated at weeks 3, 5, 8, and 12 
     poststroke. Motor impairments concerned the Fugl-Meyer assessment 
     (FM-LE) and Motricity Index total score (MI-LE) or ankle item 
     separately (MI-ankle). Postural stability during quiet 2-legged 
     stance was calculated as the net center-of-pressure area (COPArea) 
     and direction-dependent velocities (COPVel-ML and COPVel-AP). Dynamic 
     control asymmetry (DCA) and weight-bearing asymmetry (WBA) estimated 
     inter-limb symmetries in balance control and loading. Linear mixed 
     models determined (1) time-dependent change and (2) the between- and 
     within-subject associations between motor impairments and postural 
     stability or inter-limb symmetry. Results. Time-dependent 
     improvements were significant for FM-LE, MI-LE, MI-ankle, COPArea, 
     COPVel-ML, and COPVel-AP, and tended to plateau by week 8. DCA and 
     WBA did not exhibit significant change. Between-subject analyses 
     yielded significant regression coefficients for FM-LE, MI-LE, and 
     MI-ankle scores with COPArea, COPVel-ML, and COPVel-AP up until week 
     8, and with WBA until week 12. Within-subject regression coefficients 
     of motor recovery with change in COPArea, COPVel-ML, COPVel-AP, DCA, 
     or WBA were generally non-significant. Conclusions. Postural 
     stability improved significantly in the first 8 weeks poststroke, 
     independent of lower limb motor recovery at the most affected side 
     within subjects. Our findings suggest that subjects preferred to 
     compensate with their less affected side, making metrics reflecting 
     inter-limb asymmetries in balance invariant for change early 
     poststroke.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity 
     (FMA-UE) is a widely used outcome measure for quantifying motor 
     impairment in stroke recovery. Meaningful change (responsiveness) in 
     the acute to subacute phase of stroke recovery has not been 
     determined. Objective. Determine responsiveness and sensitivity to 
     change of the FMA-UE from 1-week to 6-weeks (subacute) after stroke 
     in individuals with moderate to severe arm impairment who received 
     standard clinical care. Methods. A total of 51 participants with 
     resulting moderate and severe UE hemiparesis after stroke had FMA-UE 
     assessment at baseline (within 2 weeks of stroke) and 6-weeks later. 
     Sensitivity to change was assessed using Glass's delta, standardized 
     response means (SRM), standard error of measure (SEM), and minimal 
     detectable change (MDC). Responsiveness was assessed with the minimal 
     clinically important difference (MCID), estimated using receiver 
     operating characteristic curve analysis with patient-reported global 
     rating of change scales (GROC) and a provider-reported modified 
     Rankin Scale (mRS) as anchors. Results. The MCID estimates were 13, 
     12, and 9 anchored to the GROC Arm Weakness, GROC Recovery, and mRS. 
     Glass's delta and the SRM revealed large effect sizes, indicating 
     high sensitivity to change, (∆ = 1.24, 95% CI [0.64, 1.82], SRM = 
     1.10). Results for the SEM and MDC were 2.46 and 6.82, respectively. 
     Conclusion. The estimated MCID for the FMA-UE for individuals with 
     moderate to severe motor impairment from 1 to 6-weeks after stroke is 
     13. These estimates will provide clinical context for FMA-UE change 
     scores by helping to identify the change in upper-extremity motor 
     impairment that is both beyond measurement error and clinically 
     meaningful.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The cerebellum plays a crucial role in 
     functional movement by influencing sensorimotor coordination and 
     learning. However, the effects of cortico-cerebellar connectivity on 
     the recovery of upper extremity motor function after stroke have not 
     been investigated. We hypothesized that the integrity of the 
     cortico-cerebellar connections would be reduced in patients with a 
     subacute middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, and that this reduction 
     may help to predict chronic upper extremity motor function. Methods. 
     We retrospectively analyzed the diffusion-tensor imaging of 25 
     patients with a subacute MCA stroke (mean age: 62.2 ± 2.7 years; 14 
     females) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We evaluated 
     the microstructural integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST), 
     dentatothalamocortical tract (DTCT), and corticopontocerebellar tract 
     (CPCT). Furthermore, we created linear regression models to predict 
     chronic upper extremity motor function based on the structural 
     integrity of each tract. Results. In stroke patients, the affected 
     DTCT and CST showed significantly impaired structural integrity 
     compared to unaffected tracts and the tracts in controls. When all 
     models were compared, the model that used the fractional anisotropy 
     (FA) asymmetry indices of CST and DTCT as independent variables best 
     predicted chronic upper extremity motor function (R2 = .506, P = 
     .001). The extent of structural integrity of the CPCT did not 
     significantly differ between hemispheres or groups and was not 
     predictive of motor function. Conclusions. We found evidence that 
     microstructural integrity of the DTCT in the subacute phase of an MCA 
     stroke helped to predict chronic upper extremity motor function, 
     independent of CST status.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Transauricular vagus nerve stimulation 
     (taVNS) is being studied as a feasible intervention for stroke, but 
     the mechanisms by which this non-invasive technique acts in the 
     cortex are still broadly unknown. Objectives. This study aimed to 
     systematically review the current pre-clinical evidence in the 
     auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS) neuroplastic effects in 
     stroke. Methods. We searched, in December of 2022, in Medline, 
     Cochrane, Embase, and Lilacs databases. The authors executed the 
     extraction of the data on Excel. The risk of bias was evaluated by 
     adapted Cochrane Collaboration's tool for animal studies (SYRCLES's 
     RoB tool). Results. A total of 8 studies published between 2015 and 
     2022 were included in this review, including 391 animal models. In 
     general, aVNS demonstrated a reduction in neurological deficits (SMD 
     = −1.97, 95% CI −2.57 to −1.36, I2 = 44%), in time to perform 
     the adhesive removal test (SMD = −2.26, 95% CI −4.45 to −0.08, 
     I2 = 81%), and infarct size (SMD = −1.51, 95% CI −2.42 to 
     −0.60, I2 = 58%). Regarding the neuroplasticity markers, aVNS 
     showed to increase microcapillary density, CD31 proliferation, and 
     BDNF protein levels and RNA expression. Conclusions. The studies 
     analyzed show a trend of results that demonstrate a significant 
     effect of the auricular vagal nerve stimulation in stroke animal 
     models. Although the aggregated results show high heterogeneity and 
     high risk of bias. More studies are needed to create solid 
     conclusions.]

     AB: Abstract. Despite the substantial progress in motor 
     rehabilitation, patient involvement and motivation remain major 
     challenges. They are typically addressed with communicational and 
     environmental strategies, as well as with improved goal-setting 
     procedures. Here we suggest a new research direction and framework 
     involving Neuroeconomics principles to investigate the role of Motor 
     Decision-Making (MDM) parameters in motivational component and motor 
     performance in rehabilitation. We argue that investigating NE 
     principles could bring new approaches aimed at increasing active 
     patient engagement in the rehabilitation process by introducing more 
     movement choice, and adapting existing goal-setting procedures. We 
     discuss possible MDM implementation strategies and illustrate 
     possible research directions using examples of stroke and psychiatric 
     disorders.]

     AB: Purpose: To evaluate the dissemination and implementation impacts 
     of a rehabilitation intervention. Methods: Systematic evaluation of 
     data sources including academic publishing metrics, publications, and 
     surveys was used to describe the dissemination and implementation 
     impact of the graded repetitive arm supplementary program (GRASP). 
     Three categories in the Payback Framework were evaluated: knowledge 
     production and dissemination, benefits to future research and 
     research use, and real-world uptake and implementation. Results: In 
     the Knowledge production and dissemination category, seven 
     publications, authored by the GRASP research team, were associated 
     with the GRASP, and there were approximately 17,000 download counts 
     of GRASP manuals from the website from 120 countries. In the Benefits 
     to future research and research use category, 15 studies and 8 
     registered clinical trials, authored by researchers outside of the 
     GRASP team, have used GRASP as an intervention. In the real-world 
     uptake and implementation category, GRASP has informed 
     recommendations in 2 clinical guidelines and 20 review papers, and 
     had high implementation uptake (e.g. 35% [53/154] of UK therapists 
     surveyed had used GRASP; 95% [649/681] who downloaded GRASP had used 
     it). More than 75% of those who had used GRASP identified that GRASP 
     provides more intensity in upper extremity rehabilitation, is 
     evidence-based and easy to implement, and the equipment and manual 
     are easy to obtain. Conclusion: The Payback Framework is useful to 
     evaluate the dissemination and implementation impacts of a 
     rehabilitation intervention. GRASP has been implemented extensively 
     in clinical practice and community in a relatively short time since 
     it has been developed.]

     AB: Background: Many individuals who experience a moderate or severe 
     traumatic brain injury (TBI) have long-term deficits in physical 
     activity, balance, and mobility requiring specialized care. New 
     delivery models are being investigated for interventions to address 
     challenges caused by living in remote communities, difficulties with 
     transportation, and/or physical distancing requirements. Determining 
     the effectiveness of telerehabilitation is critical given the current 
     movement toward remote health care delivery. Objective: We 
     investigated the effectiveness of two teletherapy supervision 
     schedules used to deliver a home-based, intensive exercise programme 
     on 1) physical activity, mobility, balance, participation, and 2) 
     concerns with falling, and satisfaction with life. Methods: A mixed 
     methods approach with alternating single subject design (SSD) and 
     interviews was used. Five individuals who experienced a moderate or 
     severe TBI completed two intensive home-based telerehabilitation 
     programmes. Programmes differed only by supervision schedule - daily 
     or weekly. Impacts on objective and patient-reported outcomes were 
     measured. Results: Four individuals demonstrated clinically 
     significant improvements in physical activity level, balance, and 
     mobility. One individual experienced less concerns with falling after 
     both schedules, while two other individuals showed a trend in that 
     direction after the weekly remote supervision. Important functional 
     gains (i.e. improved balance and decreased fatigue) were also 
     perceived and reported by family partners regardless of supervision 
     schedule. Conclusion: Although the study has limitations, the 
     findings indicate that exercise programmes delivered via 
     telerehabilitation can improve balance and mobility as well as 
     positively affect concerns with falling and physical activity levels 
     for this population. No clear differences were seen between the two 
     telerehabilitation supervision schedules.]

     AB: Purpose: To examine Canadian physiotherapists' experiences in 
     adapting their delivery of patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
     We examine the level of strain on the profession and barriers and 
     enablers to virtual care and provide strategies to support future 
     virtual care implementation. Methods: From May to October 2020, a 
     series of eight cross-sectional survey cycles were distributed every 
     2-4 weeks through branches and divisions of the Canadian 
     Physiotherapy Association, social media, and personal networks. 
     Descriptive statistics summarized the main findings. Open ended 
     questions were first analyzed inductively using thematic analysis, 
     then deductively mapped to the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation 
     Behavioural (COM-B) Model. Results: Between 1,820 (cycle 1) and 334 
     (cycle 7) physiotherapists responded. Median strain level was 5/5 
     (cycle 1) and dropped to median 3/5 (cycles 5-8). In cycle 1, 55% of 
     physiotherapists had ceased in-person care, while 41% were providing 
     modified in-person care. Of these physiotherapists, 79% were offering 
     virtual care. As modified in-person care increased, virtual care 
     continued as a substantial aspect of practice. Physiotherapists 
     identified barriers (e.g. lack of hands-on care) and enabling factors 
     (e.g. greater accessibility to patients) for virtual care. In-depth 
     examination of the barriers and enablers through the COM-B lens 
     identified potential interventions to support future virtual care 
     implementation, including education and training resources for 
     physiotherapists and communication and advocacy to patients and the 
     public on the value of virtual care. Conclusions: Canadian 
     physiotherapists exhibited high adaptability in response to COVID-19 
     through the rapid and widespread use of virtual care. By creating an 
     in-depth understanding of the barriers and enablers to virtual care, 
     along with potential interventions, this work will facilitate future 
     opportunities to support and enhance physiotherapists' delivery of 
     virtual care.]

     high-intensity home-based exercise programmes for people with a 
     moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is needed to inform

     determine if home-based telerehabilitation exercise programmes were 
     feasible for people with a moderate or severe TBI and (2) better 
     understand the lived experience of people with a TBI and their family 
     partners with this programme. Methods: A mixed-methods approach 
     consisting of measures of feasibility and semi-structured interviews 
     was used. Five participants with moderate to severe TBI and their 
     family partners completed two high-intensity home-based exercise 
     programmes delivered remotely by a physiotherapist (i.e. daily and 
     weekly). Results: Telerehabilitation services in home-based settings 
     were feasible for this population. Adherence and engagement were 
     high. Dyads were satisfied with the use of technology to deliver 
     physiotherapy sessions. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation provides a 
     delivery option that allows people with TBI to spend energy on 
     therapy rather than on travelling. A pre-programme training on key 
     components, such as the use of technology, safety precautions, and 
     communication methods, likely improved the overall feasibility. 
     Further research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of 
     such a programme on balance, mobility, and physical activity levels.]

     AB: Purpose: STarT Back Screening Tool and OSPRO-YF scales have been 
     reported to be accurate tools for estimating risk for the development 
     of persistent pain or prolonged disability in primary care settings. 
     We performed a comparison of construct convergent and known-group 
     validity and ceiling floor effect (CFE) of these tools using a common 
     sample of patients seen at a tertiary care spine centre. Methods: 
     This was a cross-sectional study of patients with and without a 
     work-related back injury. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
     (HADS) was used as the reference outcome measure for convergent 
     validity. For known-group validity, we examined the ability of the 
     scales to differentiate between different levels of compensation, 
     presence of non-organic signs, and work status. The CFE values were 
     calculated. Results: Fifty consecutive injured workers were included 
     along with 50 patients without an active compensation claim related 
     to their low back pain. STarTBack and OSPRO-YF had moderate to high 
     associations with the depression component of the HADS (0.69 to 0.77 
     respectively) with a statistically significant difference in favour 
     of the OSPRO-YF. STarTBack's risk stratification categories were able 
     to differentiate patients with a compensable injury, non-organic 
     signs, and inability to work (p values ranging from 0.002 to < 
     0.001). The physical activity and work fear-avoidance beliefs 
     constructs of the OSPRO-YF consistently outperformed other yellow 
     flag constructs (p values ranging from 0.008 to < 0.001). The 
     psychological sub-score of STarTBack showed a ceiling effect. There 
     was a floor effect for the negative affect domain of OSPRO-YF. 
     Neither total score had a floor or ceiling effect. Conclusions: 
     STarTBack and OSPRO-YF are short screening tools with acceptable 
     convergent and known-group construct validity and no floor or ceiling 
     effect of their total score. Both tools could assist with the 
     identification, evaluation, and management of psychological distress 
     in patients presenting to tertiary care spine centres.]

     AB: Purpose: This study examines gender differences in the 
     physiotherapy (PT) profession in the province of Quebec regarding: 
     (1) areas of practice; (2) roles associated with the advancement of 
     the profession; (3) formal disciplinary complaints; and (4) interests 
     and competency perceptions of PT students. Methods: We collected data 
     from the Canadian Institute of Health Information, the Quebec 
     Professional Order of Physiotherapy, Quebec university public 
     Internet sites, and PT associations. We also surveyed PT students at 
     the Université de Montréal. Results: The PT workforce in Quebec was 
     76.6% women. The presidents of the four main PT associations were 
     men. In the five university programmes, the percentage of male and 
     female physiotherapists in tenure track positions was 46% and 54%, 
     respectively. There were more sanctioned complaints of sexual 
     misconduct and not maintaining continuing education for male 
     physiotherapists, while more women were sanctioned for problems with 
     documentation and billing. Among students, men were more interested 
     in becoming administrators, but neither men nor women had a strong 
     interest in research. Conclusions: Male physiotherapists make up 
     23.4% of the PT workforce in Quebec but are more involved in 
     leadership positions in the profession than women.]

     AB: Purpose: Research on fiscal implications of the bundled care (BC) 
     model exist; however, patient-perceived experiences are less well 
     known. As BC expands in Ontario, this study aims to examine these 
     experiences with physiotherapy care within the total knee replacement 
     (TKR) BC programme. Methods: Qualitative cross-sectional study 
     design. Semi-structured one-on-one telephone interviews were 
     conducted with eight patients four to six weeks post-TKR. Thematic 
     analysis was used. Results: This exploratory study identified three 
     themes across the care journey that patients perceived as influencing 
     their physiotherapy experiences: timely access to physiotherapy care, 
     quality of physiotherapy care, and patient outcomes. Communication, 
     clinical support, and social support were sub-themes. Conclusions: 
     Patients' overall experiences with BC physiotherapy were positive. 
     Areas for improvement included coordination of postoperative 
     physiotherapy and return-to-work support. Patients valued group 
     settings and were interested in meeting previous TKR patients. Health 
     system planners are advised to consider incorporating patient 
     experiences when evaluating and developing BC programmes to achieve 
     patient-centred outcomes.]

     AB: Purpose: To identify older Canadians' perception of the 
     importance of expert-generated elements of walking quality, and the 
     contributors to and consequences of perceived walking quality. 
     Method: Cross-sectional survey of 649 adults was conducted through a 
     commercial participant panel, Hosted in Canada Surveys. Results: Of 
     the 649 respondents, 75% were between 65 and 74 years old (25% ≥ 
     75) and 49% were women. The most important elements were foot, ankle, 
     hip, and knee mobility with little difference in ranks across walking 
     perception (Fr χ12 = 5.0, p > 0.05). People who were older by a 
     decade were more likely to report poorer walking (POR: 1.4; 95% CI: 
     1.0, 1.7), as were women compared to men, and people who used a 
     walking aid compared to none. Lung disease showed the highest 
     association with a perception of not walking well (POR: 7.2; 95% CI: 
     3.7, 14.2). The odds of being willing to pay more for a technology to 
     improve walking were always greater for those with a lower perception 
     of their walking quality. Conclusions: People who perceived their 
     walking quality as poor were more likely to report poorer health and 
     were willing to pay more for a technology to improve walking. This 
     supports the opportunity of leveraging wearable technologies to 
     improve walking.]

     AB: ABSTRACT. Cardiovascular disease contributes to the largest 
     burden of noncommunicable diseases leading to death and disability 
     globally. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recognized as a secondary 
     prevention program for patients with cardiovascular disease. Its 
     benefits include mortality reduction, symptom relief, reduction in 
     smoking, improved exercise tolerance, risk factors modification, 
     psychosocial well-being, and early return to work (RTW). Although 
     these benefits are well known, intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
     influencing CR utilization and optimization have not been studied. 
     Thus, the present review aimed to explore factors that influence 
     health-related quality of life (HRQoL), RTW, and optimal utilization 
     of cardiac rehabilitation in adults with primary cardiac disorders. A 
     review of the literature was performed using Cochrane Library, 
     PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases. Fifty-eight studies 
     published in English during 2012-2022, conducted on adult patients 
     were included in the review. Higher education, physician support, 
     family support, and health insurance were facilitators of a better 
     quality of life. A socially vulnerable group, depression-anxiety, 
     cognitive impairments, and older age negatively influence HRQoL. RTW 
     improves HRQoL. Comprehensive CR, social support, and health-care 
     benefits lead to early occupational reintegration. Therefore, 
     improving referral, enrollment, adherence, and completion are deemed 
     necessary for optimal CR utilization.]

     AB: ABSTRACT. Complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD) impair 
     cardiovascular health and quality of life. Health-related QoL (HRQoL) 
     is influenced by cultural perspectives, social environment and health 
     behaviors that vary across countries with varying income. Therefore, 
     present review aims to report HRQoL in people with CKD and factors 
     influencing HRQoL in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Fifty 
     relevant studies were reviewed following literature search in 
     Cochrane Library, PubMed, Google Scholar and CINAHL databases using 
     key words: quality of life, CKD, and LMICs. HRQoL was poor in people 
     with CKD compared with healthy individuals. QoL was positively 
     influenced by younger age, male gender, employment and higher 
     socioeconomic status. Presence of comorbidities, anemia and low 
     hemoglobin levels were associated with poor QoL. Intrinsic and 
     extrinsic factors influencing HRQoL were similar in people with CKD 
     in LMICs and high-income countries (HICs). However, overall HRQoL and 
     mental-health scores were lower with reference to HICs. Therefore, a 
     multipronged approach designed towards prevention of kidney disease, 
     early detection and management to delay end-stage kidney disease 
     through health education, modification of risk factors, accessible 
     and affordable comprehensive management of kidney disease is 
     necessary. In resource constrained settings of LMIC, strategic 
     investment in planning and implementation of prophylactic and 
     monitoring measures will help to reduce huge financial costs 
     necessary for management and improvement of HRQoL of people with 
     CKD.]

     AB: ABSTRACT. Regular engagement in sports has demonstrated positive 
     effects on physical, psychological, and cognitive function among 
     healthy children, adults, and adults with physical disabilities. 
     Children with neuromotor impairment (NMI) are increasingly engaged in 
     sports and sports-related activities. However, research on the effect 
     of team sports on physical, psychological, and social functions in 
     children with NMI is limited. The current review summarizes the 
     effect of team sports on functioning in children with NMI. A 
     comprehensive electronic search was conducted between 2001 and 2022 
     of the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINHAL, Google Scholar, and 
     Cochrane Library databases. Seven studies reporting the effects of 
     team sports on physical and cognitive function and psychosocial 
     outcomes in children with NMIs were included. A total of 270 children 
     in age group 4-17 received 45-90 minutes of supervised team sports 
     1-5 times a week. Team sports demonstrated improvement in physical, 
     psychological, and social function such as transfer, mobility, and 
     upper-extremity function; reduced hyperactivity, aggression, 
     depression, and anxiety; improved attention; and improved social 
     acceptance and social participation. The literature review revealed 
     moderate- to high-quality evidence reporting the positive effects of 
     team sports on physical, psychological and social functioning among 
     children and adolescents with NMI. Team sports as an intervention or 
     as adjunct therapy can be prescribed to children and adolescents with 
     NMI.]

     AB: ABSTRACT. Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically diagnosed between 
     55 and 65 years of age, with increasing prevalence (> 1%−2%) above 
     60 years. The prodromal phase of PD begins at 12-14 years before the 
     disease is diagnosed, when it presents with neurodegenerative 
     symptoms or indicators. However, clinical diagnosis is possible only 
     after fully evolved PD despite an increasing number of emerging 
     imaging and biochemical biomarkers. This review summarizes apparent 
     physical signs and biochemical and radiological biomarkers indicating 
     prodromal PD. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, 
     Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Sixty-five studies, including 
     meta-analyses, systematic reviews, literature reviews, randomized 
     controlled trials, nonrandomized trials, and prospective/cohort 
     studies published between 2012 and 2022 were reviewed. Findings 
     reported depression, constipation, fatigue, urinary dysfunction, 
     olfactory disturbance, nonintentional tremors, and rapid eye movement 
     sleep behavior disorder as potential biomarkers of prodromal 
     Parkinson's disease. However, the existence of these physical 
     symptoms in isolation cannot be diagnostic. The most extensively 
     researched biochemical marker for the early diagnosis of PD is 
     α-synuclein. Other biochemical markers for PD include protein 
     deglycase genes, β-glucocerebrosidase activity, CSF o/t-syn, and 
     Aβ42/tau ratios. Radiologically, DAT imaging, vesicular monoamine 
     transporter 2 imaging, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose levels, and PET and 
     SPECT radiotracers are used for prediagnosis. Further research is 
     necessary to explore a multimodal approach using technology 
     advancements for early detection, disease monitoring, and 
     rehabilitation.]

     AB: ABSTRACT. Dance as movement therapy is known to improve balance, 
     cardiorespiratory endurance, body composition, mood, and quality of 
     life among healthy adults. Literature informing the effect of dance 
     therapy on functional-outcome based on the International 
     Classification of Function (ICF) model is lacking for children with 
     neuro-motor impairment. Thus, the current study aimed to review the 
     effect of various traditional dance forms on functioning based on the 
     ICF model in children with neuro-motor disorders. The findings will 
     inform and guide therapists and clinicians on effective utilization 
     of dance therapy as an adjunct therapeutic tool. A comprehensive 
     electronic search was conducted between 2012 and 2022 through PubMed, 
     CINAHL, Google Scholar, and Cochrane. A total of 17 articles were 
     included: 3 review articles, 2 randomized control trials, 9 
     quasi-experimental studies, and 3 case reports. Articles reporting 
     effects of dance in recreational settings, in age groups other than 
     children and adolescents, in disabilities due to conditions other 
     than neuro-motor origin, or children with severe intellectual 
     disability were excluded. High-quality evidence demonstrated positive 
     effects of dance therapy on body function domain in children with 
     neuro-motor impairments. Review presented limited and low-to-moderate 
     quality literature reporting effect of dance therapy on functions 
     related to activity domain; whereas there is low quality inconclusive 
     evidence on effect of dance therapy on participation of children with 
     neuro-motor impairment. Thus, the review concludes that dance therapy 
     is an effective adjunct tool to improve body function domain of 
     children with neuro-motor disorders.]

     lower odds of reporting decreased outdoor PA. Children from 
     multichild, higher income, married couple households and a 
     PA-supporting parent had lower odds of decreased outdoor play. Living 
     in neighborhoods with higher urbanization (i.e. high dwelling 
     density, street intersections, and land-use mix) was associated with 
     greater odds of decreased outdoor PA and play. Future research that 
     uses larger and more representative samples of children with 
     disabilities is needed to test for the multivariate effects of 
     socioecological variables on outdoor PA and play.]

     Down syndrome. Interviews were conducted with 11 guardians (five 
     mothers, four fathers, and two legal guardians) and 11 professionals 
     (four PA specialists, three physical therapists, and four 
     occupational therapists). Grounded theory was applied. Barriers and 
     facilitators fit the levels of the ecological model of health 
     behavior: (a) intrapersonal (perceived rewards), (b) interpersonal 
     (interaction), (c) community (availability of programs), (d) 
     organizational (school systems), and (e) policy (education). 
     Guardians and professionals agreed on the importance of enjoyment, 
     interaction, and programs to promote PA. Differences between groups 
     were identified at the organizational and policy levels. PA in 
     persons with Down syndrome is influenced by interactions between 
     individual and environmental factors.]

     2.76) and a control group without ID (age, M = 15.11 years, SD = 
     1.54) performed visual simple and choice reaction times, auditory 
     simple reaction time, and finger tapping tests before and after 
     running at low or moderate intensity (30% and 60% of heart rate 
     reserve [HRR], respectively). Visual simple reaction time values 
     decreased (p < .001) after both intensities at all time points with 
     higher (p = .007) extend after the 60% HRR intensity for both groups. 
     After both intensities, the VCRT decreased (p < .001) in the ID group 
     at all time points compared with preexercise (Pre-EX) while, in the 
     control group, these values decreased (p < .001) only immediately 
     (IM-EX) and after 10 min (Post-10) of exercise cessation. Compared 
     withs Pre-EX, in the ID group, the auditory simple reaction time 
     values decreased (p < .001) at all time points after the 30% HHR 
     intensity whereas, after the 60% HRR, these values decreased only at 
     IM-EX (p < .001), Post-10 (p = .001) and Post-20 (p < .001). In the 
     control group, auditory simple reaction time values decreased (p = 
     .002) only after the 30% HRR intensity at IM-EX. The finger tapping 
     test increased at IM-EX (p < .001) and at Post-20 (p = .001) compared 
     to Pre-EX in both groups only after the 30% HHR intensity and for the 
     dominant hand. The effect of physical exercise on cognitive 
     performances in individuals with ID seems to depend on the cognitive 
     test type as well as the exercise intensity.]

     AB: Children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) show a reduced 
     physical activity (PA) level compared with their typically developed 
     peers. This study aimed to identify potential predictors of 
     objectively evaluated habitual PA using data from a national clinical 
     registry-the Cerebral Palsy Follow-Up Program (CPFP)-and 
     proxy-reported questionnaires. Data from the CPFP database showed 
     that female sex was associated with a lower PA level. Additional 
     questionnaire data revealed age, popliteal angle limitation, 
     Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument-Sports and Physical 
     Functioning Scale score, screen time, Functional Mobility Scale score 
     at 50 m, and fatigue as predictors. The proposed models can be used 
     for the prediction and early detection of the PA level and 
     consequently for the potential improvement among 
     ambulant/semiambulant individuals with CP. Further research should 
     investigate the predictive impact of personal, social, and 
     environmental factors on the PA level and the gap in PA levels 
     between girls and boys.]

     Special Olympics (SO) and academy football (soccer) players in the 
     United Kingdom from the perspectives of players and facilitators. 
     Qualitative focus groups were conducted across 30 participants (six 
     facilitators, 14 Premier League academy players, and 10 SO players). 
     Focus groups compared stakeholders' experiences of participating in a 
     season-long inclusive football program. Three overarching higher 
     order themes were generated, which highlighted positive outcomes from 
     taking part. SO players provided endorsement for developing 
     friendships and improving football skills, whereas academy players 
     cited the positive impact that SO players had on their mood and 
     motivation. Facilitators reflected on positive player outcomes and 
     subsequent accomplishments. Overall, the findings indicated that this 
     shared experience had psychosocial and football-specific benefits for 
     everyone who participated. Facilitators indicated that these benefits 
     could transition into everyday life but noted that there needs to be 
     further considerations for future programs.]

     expressed unique physical activity (PA) information needs. 
     Community-based organizations (CBOs) require assistance to meet these 
     needs. Guided by the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation 
     II, this project established evidence-informed recommendations for 
     developing PA information targeting families of CYD. This process 
     involved a systematic scoping review to inform draft recommendations 
     (k = 23), which were revised via a consensus meeting with 
     researchers, knowledge users from CBOs, and families of CYD. Broader 
     consultation with CBO knowledge users informed the final 
     recommendations (k = 5) that fit within the following categories: (a) 
     language and definitions, (b) program information, (c) benefits of 
     PA, (d) barriers to PA, and (e) PA ideas and self-regulation tools. 
     CBOs are encouraged to consider these recommendations when developing 
     PA information for families of CYD. Future research will focus on the 
     development of knowledge products to disseminate the recommendations 
     to CBOs and support implementation.]

     AB: Children with autism engage in active play in different ways than 
     children who are neurotypical, but their active play behaviors are 
     not well understood. Research with twins and triplets with autism 
     offers a unique opportunity to gain a clear picture of the play 
     behaviors of children with autism because twins and triplets share 
     many similarities (age, access to toys, etc.). Through semistructured 
     interviews, this descriptive phenomenological study aimed to describe 
     the active play behaviors of 19 twins and triplets with autism from 
     the perspective of their parents (N = 9). The interviews revealed two 
     main themes: (a) parents' descriptions of active play and (b) 
     parents' descriptions of social play. The results reveal the diverse 
     active and social play behaviors of twins and triplets with autism; 
     parents described their children's play behavior when engaging in 
     sensory, indoor, outdoor, and organized play. These results suggest 
     that children with autism may be meeting the definition of active 
     play in nontraditional ways.]

     studies documented inconsistencies in their effectiveness, with some 
     demonstrating positive effects while others reported limited support

     children with autism in physical education. A total of 27 articles 
     were reviewed, which included empirical- and narrative-based 
     manuscripts. Results suggest that picture task cards, visual activity 
     schedules, and video prompting can be potential strategies that 
     physical educators can use to teach motor skills to children on the

     AB: Abstract. Background. There is evidence that community-based 
     palliative care programmes can improve patient outcomes and caregiver 
     experiences cost-effectively. However, little is known about which 
     specific components within these programmes contribute to improving 
     the outcomes. Aim. To systematically review research that evaluates 
     the effectiveness of community-based palliative care components. 
     Design. A systematic mixed studies review synthesising quantitative, 
     qualitative and mixed-methods study findings using Preferred 
     Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. 
     PROSPERO: ID # CRD42022302305. Data sources. Four databases were 
     searched in August 2021 (CINAHL, Web of Science, ProQuest Federated 
     and PubMed including MEDLINE) and a close review of included article 
     references. Inclusion criteria required articles to evaluate a 
     single, specific component of a community-based palliative care 
     programme either within an individual programme or across several 
     programmes. Results. Overall, a total of 1,674 articles were 
     identified, with 57 meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the included 
     studies, 21 were qualitative, 25 were quantitative and 11 had mixed 
     methods. Outcome measures consistently examined included 
     patient/caregiver satisfaction, hospital utilisation and home deaths. 
     The components of standardised sessions (interdisciplinary meetings 
     about patients), volunteer engagement and early intervention 
     contributed to the success of community-based palliative care 
     programmes. Conclusions. Certain components of community-based 
     palliative care programmes are effective. Such components should be 
     implemented and tested more in low- and middle-income countries and 
     key and vulnerable populations such as lower-income and marginalised 
     racial or ethnic groups. In addition, more research is needed on the 
     cost-effectiveness of individual programme components.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. The variable and intermittent nature of 
     stuttering makes it difficult to consistently elicit a sufficient 
     number of stuttered trials for longitudinal experimental research. 
     This study tests the efficacy of using non-word pairs that 
     phonetically mimic English words with no associated meaning, to 
     reliably elicit balanced numbers of stuttering and fluent trials over 
     multiple sessions. The study also evaluated the effect of non-word 
     length on stuttering frequency, the consistency of stuttering 
     frequency across sessions, and potential carry-over effects of 
     increased stuttering frequency in the experimental task to 
     conversational and reading speech after the task. Methods. Twelve 
     adults who stutter completed multiple sessions (mean of 4.8 sessions) 
     where they were video-recorded during pre-task reading and 
     conversation, followed by an experimental task where they read 400 
     non-word pairs randomized for each session, and then a post-task 
     reading and conversation sample. Results. On average, across sessions 
     and participants, non-word pairs consistently yielded a balanced 
     distribution of fluent (60.7%) and stuttered (39.3%) trials over five 
     sessions. Non-word length had a positive effect on stuttering 
     frequency. No carryover effects from experimental to post-task 
     conversation and reading were found. Conclusions. Non-word pairs 
     effectively and consistently elicited balanced proportions of 
     stuttered and fluent trials. This approach can be used to gather 
     longitudinal data to better understand the neurophysiological and 
     behavioral correlates of stuttering.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. By gaining insight into the Quality of Life 
     (QoL) status and occurrence of complications, critical facets in the 
     care for patients with Fracture-Related Infection (FRI) can be 
     mitigated and measures can be taken to improve their outcome. 
     Therefore, the aims of this study were to 1) determine the QoL in FRI 
     patients in comparison to non-FRI patients and 2) describe the 
     occurrence of other complications in both FRI and non-FRI patients. 
     Methods. An ambidirectional cohort study was conducted in a level 1 
     trauma centre between January 1st 2016 and November 1st 2021. All 
     patients who underwent surgical stabilisation of an isolated long 
     bone fracture were eligible for inclusion. To avoid confounding, only 
     patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) <16 were included. Data 
     regarding patient demographics, fracture characteristics, treatment, 
     follow-up and complications were collected of both non-FRI and FRI 
     patients. QoL was assessed through the use of five-level EuroQol 
     five-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires twelve months post-injury. 
     Results. A total of 134 patients were included in this study, of whom 
     38 (28%) FRI patients and 96 (72%) non-FRI patients. In comparison to 
     non-FRI patients, FRI patients scored significantly worse on the QoL 
     assessment regarding the index value (p = 0.012) and the domains 
     mobility (p<0.001), usual activities (p = 0.010) and pain/discomfort 
     (p = 0.009). Other postoperative complications were more often 
     reported (p<0.001) in FRI patients (66%, n = 25/38) compared to 
     non-FRI patients (27%, n = 26/96). During the median follow-up of 
     14.5 months (interquartile range (IQR) 9.5-26.5), 25 FRI patients 
     developed a total of 49 distinctive complications besides FRI. The 
     complications nonunion (18%, n = 9/49), infection other than FRI 
     (e.g. line infection, urinary tract infection, pneumonia) (18%, n = 
     9/49) and implant failure (14%, n = 7/49) were the most frequently 
     described in the FRI group. Conclusion. Patients who suffered from an 
     FRI have a decreased QoL in comparison to those without an FRI. 
     Moreover, patients with an FRI have a higher rate of additional 
     complications. These findings can help in patient counselling 
     regarding the potential physical and mental consequences of having a 
     complicated course of recovery due to an infection.]

     AB: Abstract. Injury is a leading cause of health loss in Aotearoa me 
     Te Waipounamu (New Zealand; NZ). The NZ Trauma Registry was 
     established in 2015 to monitor outcomes in those experiencing severe 
     injury and to identify ways of improving the quality of care for 
     these patients. Few NZ studies have assessed outcomes in trauma 
     patients using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) despite 
     increasing recognition that the impacts of injury are better 
     understood through PROMs. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of 
     self-reported problems with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
     outcomes six months post-injury, and identify factors associated with 
     these, in a cohort of Māori (the Indigenous population of NZ) and 
     non-Māori individuals who had experienced major trauma. HRQoL 
     outcomes were measured according to the five dimensions of the 
     EQ-5D-5L. This information, along with sociodemographic data, was 
     collected via structured telephone interviews. Participants (n = 
     870), aged 16 years or more, were recruited following admission to a 
     trauma hospital in one of three (of NZ's four) trauma regions. 
     Multivariable models were developed using modified Poisson Regression 
     to identify factors associated with outcomes for both Māori and 
     non-Māori patients. The prevalence and severity of problems across 
     each of the five EQ-5D-5L dimensions was similar for Māori and 
     non-Māori except for Anxiety/Depression. The prevalence and severity 
     of problems with Anxiety/Depression was greater for Māori. Factors 
     associated with HRQoL problems at six-months were also largely 
     similar for each cohort. Those commonly associated with outcomes were 
     age, hospital length of stay, adequacy of household income, and 
     participants' expectations regarding recovery from injury. Further 
     research examining recovery expectations in trauma patients to 
     determine which factors contribute to formulating recovery 
     expectations, and the potential impact of recovery expectations on 
     treatment and rehabilitation, would be of value. Should expectations, 
     at least in part, influence HRQoL outcomes, then routinely collecting 
     data on patients' recovery expectations, adequacy of household income 
     and potential barriers to treatment and rehabilitation, could help 
     inform post-hospital treatment plans, and identify those who may 
     require additional support following discharge from hospital.]

     factors that influence physical activity and sedentary behaviour in 
     both hospital and home settings before and after discharge from acute 
     hospitalisation for fractures. Objective. To describe and compare 
     perceptions of environmental influences on physical activity in 
     hospital and home settings in people recovering from fractures. 
     Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients 
     hospitalised following fractures (hip fracture or multi-trauma), 
     exploring the barriers and enablers to physical activity within 
     hospital and home settings. Interviews were conducted within two 
     weeks of hospital discharge, audio recorded and transcribed prior to 
     thematic analysis via a framework approach. Results. Between December 
     2022 and May 2023, 12 semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 
     an equal number of participants who sustained an isolated hip 
     fracture or multi-trauma. The median (IQR) age of participants was 60 
     (52-68) years, with half being male, and the majority sustaining 
     their injuries via transport crashes. Three main themes that 
     influenced physical activity behaviours in hospital and home settings 
     were: having the opportunity, having a reason, and having support and 
     assistance to be active. Conclusion. During the period of reduced 
     physical capability following fracture, patients need to be provided 
     with opportunities and motivation to be active, particularly within 
     the hospital setting. Findings from this study will assist clinicians 
     to better support people recovering from fractures via greater

     AB: Abstract. Background. Early mobilization following ankle fracture 
     open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) improves long-term 
     patient functionality. Because of this, numerous resources have been 
     spent to increase patient adherence to post-operative mobilization, 
     with range of motion (ROM) measurements generally considered an 
     important outcome in patient recovery. In this study we investigated 
     how ankle ROM correlates to patient function, self-sufficiency in 
     performing activities of daily living (ADLs), and pain in the early 
     post-operative period. Methods. This was a prospective, observational 
     study on patients undergoing ORIF of ankle fractures. We collected 
     patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and ROM measurements at the 
     2-week, 6-week, 12-week, and 6 month post-operative visit. We 
     collected three PROMs: pain intensity (VAS), pain self-efficacy 
     questionnaire (PSEQ-2), and foot and ankle ability measurement 
     (FAAM). ROM of the ankle was measured by goniometer. ANOVA and 
     post-hoc Tukey tests were used to examine statistical differences in

     (post-hoc p = 0.006), after which pain intensity did not differ 
     significantly. FAAM scores for activities or daily living (ADL) were 
     increased at all study visits compared to enrollment (post-hoc p < 
     0.001). FAAM-Sports scores were higher compared to enrollment at the 
     week 12 and 6 month visits (post-hoc p < 0.001). No significant 
     improvements in goniometer measurements were noted across any 
     timepoints. There were no significant correlations between ROM and 
     PROMs at any of the study visits. Conclusion. In our cohort of 
     patients, there was no correlation between ROM and patient pain, 
     self-efficacy or functionality in the early post-operative period 
     following ankle ORIF. The lack of correlation between PROMs and ROM 
     indicates that ROM may be both a poor indicator of patient 
     improvement for physicians to guide post-operative treatment as well 
     as a poor motivator for patient adherence to post-operative 
     exercises. In the future, it is important to study reliable outcome 
     measures in early recovery that can be utilized to track patient 
     recovery from ankle ORIF.]

     AB: Abstract. Aims. This study aims to explore the experiences of 
     rehabilitation specialist nurses in providing bowel care to stroke 
     patients and to identify the factors that either facilitate or hinder 
     their practice. Design. This was a descriptive qualitative design 
     study. Methods. Between May 2022 and October 2022, we conducted 
     in-depth and semi-structured interviews with 12 rehabilitation 
     specialist nurses from two tertiary hospitals in Changsha, China. 
     Thematic analysis was employed to analyse the interview transcripts. 
     Findings. Three key themes were revealed from our analysis: (1) 
     acceptance of bowel care as a process, (2) high level of recognition 
     improves the experience and (3) challenges stemming from limited 
     knowledge and rights. Acceptance of bowel care as a dynamic process, 
     coupled with a high level of recognition, enabled nurses to 
     prioritize the health and safety of patients over personal feelings 
     and achieve professional accomplishments. However, they encountered 
     challenges in terms of professional development and restricted 
     prescribing rights for bowel care. Conclusion. The experiences of 
     rehabilitation specialist nurses in providing bowel care are dynamic. 
     These findings have important implications for healthcare 
     improvement, including the need for collaboration with healthcare 
     professionals and nurturing nurses' self-identity, comprehensive 
     training plans, innovative programs and expanding the scope of 
     rehabilitation specialist nurses' rights. Impact. This study enhances 
     our understanding of the challenges faced by rehabilitation 
     specialist nurses caring for stroke patients with neurogenic bowel 
     dysfunction. The findings provide insights into how to enhance bowel 
     care experience and develop further in this field.]

     AB: Abstract. Aims. To explore the impact of the coronavirus disease 
     2019 pandemic on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of breast 
     cancer survivors. Design: We utilized a qualitative descriptive 
     approach to facilitate interviews among 25 participants, all of whom 
     are survivors of breast cancer and have received treatment in Hong 
     Kong within the preceding 3 years. Methods. Content analysis was 
     performed to understand how patients' HRQoL views and experiences 
     changed during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Results. The 
     results included six themes delineating the impact of the coronavirus 
     disease 2019 pandemic: (i) survivor sensitivities in pandemic times, 
     (ii) coping and conditioning in pandemic times, (iii) transforming 
     work and home dynamics in pandemic times, (iv) cognitive resilience 
     and adaptation to the COVID-19 protective measures, (v) social 
     resilience in pandemic times and (vi) healthcare adaptation and 
     coping in pandemic times. Conclusion. This study provides insights 
     into the experiences and challenges of breast cancer survivors during 
     the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Some survivors had new 
     physical and psychological symptoms, including fear and anxiety, 
     isolation, pain, lymphoedema and burnout, which potentially have 
     long-term impact upon HRQoL. Implications for the profession and/or 
     patient care. This study highlights the unique challenges faced by 
     breast cancer survivors during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, 
     including accessing healthcare services and the impact of social 
     isolation. Healthcare providers should consider the holistic needs of 
     breast cancer survivors in the provision of health care and develop 
     supportive interventions, including telehealth services and online 
     support groups, to address these challenges and improve their HRQoL. 
     Impact. Surgery aimed at treating breast cancer or reducing its risk 
     generally influences the appearance of breast areas and donor sites. 
     The continuing effects of these changes on body image and HRQoL are 
     well-reported, although studies have ineffectively examined the 
     initial experiences of women regarding their postoperative 
     appearance, particularly during the pandemic.]

     play intervention to promote social and personal development in 
     preschoolers during cancer treatment. Design. A 
     hermeneutic-phenomenological inspired explorative study. Methods. 
     Participant observations were conducted on 15 consecutively sampled 
     children (aged 1-5 years) from April 2021 to April 2022. Observations 
     were written as narrative scenic descriptions from field notes and 
     were analysed inspired by hermeneutic-phenomenological analysis and 
     using a thematic analysis structure. Results. Observations were 
     carried out during 67 group or individual structured active play 
     sessions, resulting in 129 scenic descriptions. Observations of the 
     children's emotional, verbal and bodily expressions and social 
     interactions resulted in three main themes: (1) wanting to play, (2) 
     gaining confidence in movement and (3) being part of a group. The 
     findings showed how children, irrespective of age and the severity of 
     their illness, wanted to play and expressed joy of movement. The 
     children's daily physical state fluctuated and influenced their 
     motivation to participate as well as their confidence in their 
     physical abilities. Through structured active play and with support 
     from their parents and healthcare professionals, the children had 
     successful movement experiences and regained confidence in movement, 
     supporting their personal development. Playing together with other 
     children and accompanied by their parents, healthcare professionals 
     supported the children's opportunities to practice social skills, 
     such as turn-taking, waiting and taking charge. Familiarity, 
     recognizability and fun were key motivational components for the 
     children. Conclusion. Participating in structured active play during 
     treatment has the potential to promote personal and social 
     development in preschoolers with cancer. Parents play a crucial role 
     in supporting the participation of their children. Implications for 
     the Profession and/or. Patient: Care. The healthcare system and 
     healthcare professionals should provide opportunities for

     AB: Abstract. Background. Despite the existence of evidence-based 
     rehabilitation strategies that address biomechanical deficits, the 
     persistence of recurrent ankle problems in 70% of patients with acute 
     ankle sprains highlights the unresolved nature of this issue. 
     Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising tool to identify 
     definitive predictors for ankle sprains. This paper aims to summarize 
     the use of AI in investigating the ankle biomechanics of healthy and 
     subjects with ankle sprains. Methods. Articles published between 2010 
     and 2023 were searched from five electronic databases. 59 papers were 
     included for analysis with regards to: i). types of motion tested 
     (functional vs. purposeful ankle movement); ii) types of 
     biomechanical parameters measured (kinetic vs kinematic); iii) types 
     of sensor systems used (lab-based vs field-based); and, iv) AI 
     techniques used. Findings. Most studies (83.1%) examined biomechanics 
     during functional motion. Single kinematic parameter, specifically 
     ankle range of motion, could obtain accuracy up to 100% in 
     identifying injury status. Wearable sensor exhibited high reliability 
     for use in both laboratory and on-field/clinical settings. AI 
     algorithms primarily utilized electromyography and joint angle 
     information as input data. Support vector machine was the most used 
     supervised learning algorithm (18.64%), while artificial neural 
     network demonstrated the highest accuracy in eight studies. 
     Interpretations. The potential for remote patient monitoring is 
     evident with the adoption of field-based devices. Nevertheless, 
     AI-based sensors are underutilized in detecting ankle motions at risk 
     of sprain. We identify three key challenges: sensor designs, the 
     controllability of AI models, and the integration of AI-sensor 
     models, providing valuable insights for future research.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Aging is associated with changes in 
     neuromuscular control that can lead to difficulties in performing 
     daily living tasks. Muscle synergy analysis allows the assessment of 
     neuromuscular control strategies and functional deficits. However, 
     the age-related changes of muscle synergies during functional tasks 
     are scattered throughout the literature. This review aimed to 
     synthesize the existing literature on muscle synergies in elderly 
     people during daily-living tasks and examine how they differ from 
     those exhibited by young adults. Methods. The Medline, CINAHL and Web 
     of Science databases were searched. Studies were included if they 
     focused on muscle synergies in elderly people during walking, 
     sit-to-stand or stair ascent, and if muscle synergies were obtained 
     by a matrix factorization algorithm. Findings. Seventeen studies were 
     included after the screening process. The muscle synergies of 295 
     elderly people and 182 young adults were reported, including 5 to 16 
     muscles per leg, or leg and trunk. Results suggest that: 1) elderly 
     people and young adults retain similar muscle synergies' number, 2) 
     elderly people have higher muscles weighting during walking, and 3) 
     an increased inter and intra-subject temporal activation variability 
     during specific tasks (i.e. walking and stair ascent, respectively) 
     was reported in elderly people compared to young adults. 
     Interpretation. This review gives a comprehensive understanding of 
     age-related changes in neuromuscular control during daily living 
     tasks. Our findings suggested that although the number of synergies 
     remains similar, metrics such as spatial and temporal structures of 
     synergies are more suitable to identify neuromuscular control 
     deficits between young adults and elderly people.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Navigating your environment requires both 
     straight-line gait as well as turning. Gait speed normative values 
     are well established and utilized in determining a person's 
     functional status, however, it has limitations. This study sought to 
     examine whether turning speed declines with age and how it compared 
     to gait speed age-related decline. Methods. A secondary analysis was 
     performed on 275 community dwelling adults between the ages of 18-88 
     that performed a timed walking test with an inertial measurement unit 
     on their lumbar spine. Turning speed and walking speed were extracted 
     for each participant. A series of mixed models were compared, and 
     Akaike's Information Criterion was used to determine the best fit 
     model between age and turning speed and age and gait speed. Findings. 
     Turning speed and gait speed normative values were reported for each 
     age decade. A linear model with a random intercept of "Condition" was 
     used to assess the relationship between age and turning speed. The 
     results indicated a significant negative relationship between age and 
     turning speed (B = -0.66, p < 0.001). A spline-fit model determined a 
     significant negative relationship between age and gait speed after 
     the age of 65 (B = -0.0097, p = 0.002). The effect of age on gait 
     speed before age 65 was not significant. Interpretation. Turning 
     speed significantly declines with age in a linear fashion while gait 
     speed begins to decline after age 65. Turning speed may be more 
     responsive to age than gait speed. More research is needed to 
     determine if the decline in turning speed with age is associated with 
     a decline in function.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. We compared the effects of whole-body 
     vibration training and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation on 
     the biomechanical characteristics of the lower limbs in functional 
     ankle instability patients during cutting movement to ascertain the 
     superior rehabilitation method. Methods. Twenty-two male College 
     students with unilateral functional ankle instability volunteered for 
     this study and were randomly divided into whole-body vibration 
     training group and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation group. 
     Kinematics data and ground reaction forces were collected using 
     infrared motion capture system and 3-D force plates synchronously 
     during cutting. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA was performed to 
     analyze the data. Findings. Both training methods reduced the maximum 
     hip abduction angle (p = 0.010, effect size: proprioceptive 
     neuromuscular facilitation = 0.69; whole-body vibration training = 
     0.20), maximum knee flexion angle (p = 0.008, effect size: 
     proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation = 0.39, whole-body 
     vibration training = 1.26) and angular velocity (p = 0.014, effect 
     size: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation = 0.62, whole-body 
     vibration training = 0.55), maximum ankle inversion angular velocity 
     (p = 0.020, effect size: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation = 
     0.52, whole-body vibration training = 0.81), and knee flexion angle 
     at the time of maximum vertical ground reaction forces (p = 0.018, 
     effect size: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation = 0.27, 
     whole-body vibration training = 0.76), and increased the maximum 
     ankle dorsiflexion moment (p = 0.049, effect size: proprioceptive 
     neuromuscular facilitation = −0.52, whole-body vibration training = 
     −0.22). Whole-body vibration training reduced the maximum ground 
     reaction forces value in the mediolateral directions (p = 0.010, 
     effect size = 0.82) during cutting movement. Interpretation. These 
     findings suggested that the two types of training might increase 
     neuromuscular conduction function around the ankle. After these two 
     types of training, functional ankle instability patients showed a 
     similar risk of injury to the lateral ankle ligaments during 
     cutting.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Joint moment arm is a major element that 
     determines joint torque. This study aimed to investigate factors 
     associated with knee extensor and valgus moment arms of the patellar 
     tendon in older individuals with and without knee osteoarthritis. 
     Methods. Thirty-six participants with knee osteoarthritis (mean age, 
     78.1 ± 6.0 years) and 43 healthy controls (mean age, 73.0 ± 6.3 
     years) were analyzed. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the knee 
     joint and thigh were acquired using a 3.0 T MRI scanner. The 
     three-dimensional moment arm was defined as the distance between the 
     contact point of the tibiofemoral joint and the patellar tendon line. 
     The three-dimensional moment arm was decomposed into sagittal and 
     coronal components, which were calculated as knee extensor and valgus 
     moment arms, respectively. Quadriceps muscle volume, epicondylar 
     width, bisect offset, Insall-Salvati ratio, and Kellgren-Lawrence 
     grade were assessed. Multiple regression analyses were performed in 
     the healthy control and knee osteoarthritis groups, with knee 
     extensor and valgus moment arms as dependent variables. Findings. 
     Knee extensor moment arm was significantly associated with 
     epicondylar width and the Insall-Salvati ratio in the healthy control 
     group and with Kellgren-Lawrence grade, epicondylar width, and 
     quadriceps muscle volume in the knee osteoarthritis group. Valgus 
     knee moment arm was significantly associated with bisect offset in 
     both the groups. Interpretation. Knee size, osteoarthritis severity, 
     and quadriceps muscle volume affect the knee extensor moment arm in 
     knee osteoarthritis, whereas lateral patellar displacement affects 
     the valgus knee moment arms in older individuals with and without 
     knee osteoarthritis.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Early detection of balance-related 
     pathologies in adults using Posturography, anthropometric and 
     personal data is limited. Our goal is to address this issue. It will 
     enable us to identify adults in early stages of balance disorders 
     using easily accessible and measurable data. Methods. Open-source 
     data of 163 subjects (47 males and 116 females) is used to train and 
     test classification algorithms. Features include mean and standard 
     deviation of the center of pressure displacement, obtained through 
     posturography, the anthropometric and personal variables (age, sex, 
     body mass index, foot length), and Trail Making Test scores. 75% of 
     the data is employed for training and 25% of the data is used for 
     testing. It is then validated using an indigenously collected dataset 
     of healthy individuals. Findings. Accuracy and Sensitivity, both, 
     increases when anthropometric and personal variables are included 
     alongside center of pressure features for classification. Specificity 
     decreases slightly with the addition of anthropometric and personal 
     variables with center of pressure displacement feature, which also 
     affects the classification algorithms' performance. Standard 
     deviation of the center of pressure displacement is found to be more 
     effective than the mean value. A similar trend of the increased 
     performance is observed during validation, except when neural 
     networks were used for the classification. Interpretation. 
     Posturography data, Anthropometric measurements, personal data and 
     self-assessment scales can identify balance issues in adults, making 
     it suitable for community health centers with limited resources. 
     Early detection prompts timely medical care, improving the management 
     of disorders and thus enhancing the quality of life through 
     rehabilitation.]

     quantify the upper limb motor function after stroke. However, 
     previous studies have rarely reported the kinematic data of the 
     post-stroke patients with moderate to severe upper limb paresis due 
     to the poor accomplishment of the complex tasks. Methods. 27 
     post-stroke individuals and 20 non-disabled people participated in 
     the study. The trunk and upper limb movements during the 
     Hand-to-mouth task were captured by the motion capture system and 
     upper extremity kinematic analysis software automatically. The 
     subgroup analysis within stroke group were conducted layering by the 
     Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity scores (severe: 16-31; 
     moderate: 32-50). Findings. The paretic upper limbs in the stroke 
     group tended to use more trunk and shoulder compensatory strategies 
     to offset the impact of spasticity and weakness compared with 
     non-disabled controls. The less-affected limbs in the stroke group 
     also showed abnormal kinematic data. There were significant 
     differences between the kinematic metrics of severe and moderate 
     subgroups. Interpretation. The Hand-to-mouth task is a good and 
     feasible option for kinematic analysis of these patients. It is

     AB: Abstract. Background. Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a 
     heritable connective tissue disorder, is associated with muscle 
     dysfunction, joint subluxations and pain. The impact of hypermobile 
     Ehlers Danlos Syndrome on musculoskeletal mechanics is understudied. 
     Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of 
     hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome on lower extremity gait mechanics 
     and muscle strength. Methods. Eleven people with hypermobile Ehlers 
     Danlos Syndrome and 11 asymptomatic controls underwent a 3D gait 
     analysis and isometric hip and knee muscle strength assessment. Joint 
     subluxations were self-reported by the hypermobile Ehlers Danlos 
     syndrome group. Independent t-tests and Mann Whitney U tests were 
     used to analyze joint mechanics, muscle strength, and patient report 
     outcomes (p < 0.05). Findings. Both groups exhibited similar walking 
     speeds as well as similar hip, knee, and ankle joint kinematics. The 
     hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome group walked with a lower peak hip 
     extensor moment (hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome: -0.52 ± 0.28 
     Nmˑkg−1, Control: -0.83 ± 0.26 Nmˑkg−1, p = 0.01) yet similar 
     knee and ankle joint moments. The hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome 
     group exhibited a 40% deficit in peak hip extensor strength 
     (hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome:1.07 ± 0.53 Nmˑkg−1, Control: 
     1.77 ± 0.79 Nmˑkg−1, p = 0.04). Approximately 73%, 55% and 45% of 
     the hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome cohort self-reported hip, 
     knee/patella and ankle joint subluxations, respectively, at least 
     once a week. Interpretation. Patients with hypermobile Ehlers Danlos 
     Syndrome ambulated with altered hip extensor moments and exhibit hip 
     extensor weakness. Future work should investigate the underlying 
     mechanisms of hip extensor weakness and corresponding effects on 
     joint health in people with hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. In total knee arthroplasty, unrestricted 
     kinematic alignment aims to restore pre-arthritic lower limb 
     alignment and joint lines. Joint line orientations of the 
     contralateral healthy proximal tibia might be used to evaluate 
     accuracy of tibial component alignment post-operatively if asymmetry 
     is minimal. Our objective was to evaluate left-to-right asymmetry of 
     the proximal tibial epiphysis in posterior tibial slope and 
     varus-valgus orientation as related to unrestricted kinematic 
     alignment principles. Methods. High resolution CT images (0.5 mm 
     slice thickness) were acquired from bilateral lower limbs of 11 
     skeletally mature subjects with no skeletal abnormalities. Images 
     were segmented to generate 3D tibia models. Asymmetry was quantified 
     by differences in orientations required to shape-match the proximal 
     epiphysis of the mirror 3D tibia model to the proximal epiphysis of 
     the contralateral 3D tibia model. Findings. Systematic and random 
     differences (i.e. mean ± standard deviation) in tibial slope and 
     varus-valgus orientation were − 0.8° ± 1.2° and − 0.2° ± 
     0.8°, respectively. Ninety five percent confidence intervals on the 
     means included 0° indicating that systematic differences were 
     minimal. Interpretation. Since random differences due to asymmetry 
     are substantial in relation to random surgical deviations from 
     pre-arthritic joint lines previously reported, post-operative 
     computer tomograms of the contralateral healthy tibia should not be 
     used to directly assess accuracy of tibial component alignment on a 
     group level without correcting for differences in tibial slope and 
     varus-valgus orientation due to asymmetry.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Individuals with chronic ankle instability 
     often present with clinical and biomechanical abnormalities, however 
     squat biomechanics have not been investigated. The purpose of this 
     study was to compare select clinical assessments and squat 
     biomechanics between individuals with and without chronic ankle 
     instability. Methods. Fifteen individuals with chronic ankle 
     instability and a matched control group were studied. A 
     weight-bearing dorsiflexion lunge test, foot posture, and an in-line 
     half-kneeling motor control test for core stability were assessed. 
     Lower limb 3D bilateral and unilateral squat biomechanics were 
     captured. Groups, limbs and squat tasks were compared using an alpha 
     of 0.05. Findings. Individuals with chronic ankle instability had 
     less static weight-bearing dorsiflexion and failed the core stability 
     test more frequently, but did not differ in foot morphology compared 
     to the controls. When squatting, those with chronic ankle instability 
     demonstrated reduced peak ankle dorsiflexion angles and moments in 
     the involved limb (p < 0.04) during single limb squats and had 
     interlimb differences in ankle dorsiflexion angle as well as hip and 
     knee kinetics (p < 0.04) during double limb squats. In those with 
     chronic ankle instability, there was less overall motion, but higher 
     kinetic demands in single limb versus double leg squatting (p < 
     0.03). Interpretation. Individuals with chronic ankle instability had 
     impaired weight-bearing dorsiflexion and showed impaired core 
     stability more often, which accompanied altered squatting mechanics 
     in both variations. Within the limbs with chronic ankle instability, 
     single limb squats showed lesser kinematic demands but higher kinetic 
     demands than double limb squatting.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Leg extensions should be avoided in the 
     early stages after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction because 
     the force exerted by the quadriceps muscle leads to anterior tibial 
     displacement. To allow for safe quadriceps training in the knee 
     extension range during this period, we devised the leaf spring 
     exercise, which involves placing subjects in the prone position with 
     their knee slightly flexed and instructing them to perform maximum 
     isometric quadriceps contractions while supporting the proximal 
     region of the lower leg's anterior surface and immobilizing the 
     femur's posterior surface to prevent lifting. The current study aimed 
     to examine the safety of Leaf spring exercise by determining the 
     femur-tibia relationship using ultrasound imaging. Methods: This 
     controlled laboratory study included patients with unilateral 
     anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees (8 men and 8 women; age, 
     24.2 ± 8.3 years) who were instructed to perform Leaf spring 
     exercise of both lower limbs. We measured the femur-tibia-step-off, 
     which indicates the distance between the last point of the medial and 
     lateral condyles of the femur and posterior margin of the tibial 
     plateau, as a parameter to evaluate anterior tibial displacement via 
     ultrasound diagnostic device. Further, peak torque of the quadriceps 
     muscle was calculated using force measurement device. Findings. No 
     difference in anterior tibial displacement and peak torque was 
     observed between the uninjured and injured sides during Leaf spring 
     exercise. Interpretation. Leaf spring exercise may add some strain on 
     the reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament; hence, it can be 
     considered a safe quadriceps exercise in the knee extension range.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The use of movement screens as a clinical 
     tool for injury risk assessment requires variables to be extracted 
     across specific phases of interest. While manually selecting task 
     events is the traditional method, automated event detection is an 
     effective technique that maintains consistency across a cohort. This 
     study aimed to examine variations in event identification, comparing 
     manual detection and the application of an automated algorithm, with 
     a specific focus on a drop vertical jump task. Methods. Thirty 
     participants cleared to return-to-play after anterior cruciate 
     ligament reconstruction and thirty controls were tested. For the 
     automated event detection, normalized vertical ground reaction force 
     and the velocity of the sacrum marker were used to identify five 
     events during the drop vertical jump: initial contact, end of 
     loading, end of propulsion, second contact, and end of second 
     loading. Two raters manually selected events and were compared to the 
     event times of the automated algorithm. Findings. Manual event 
     detection exhibited excellent reliability Significant differences 
     between manual and automated detection were observed, particularly at 
     events indicating the lowest squat position (Event2 and Event5). 
     Participants who had undergone anterior cruciate ligament 
     reconstruction demonstrated larger differences than controls at 
     Event5, correlating with significant squat depth disparities. 
     Interpretation. While manual event detection demonstrated 
     reliability, automated algorithms revealed differences, specifically 
     in events of the drop vertical jump involving the lowest squat 
     position. The automated algorithm presents potential benefits in 
     reducing processing time and enhancing accuracy for event 
     identification, offering valuable insights for motion capture 
     applications in clinical settings.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Individuals with cerebral-palsy commonly 
     present with altered kinematics and selective-motor-control during 
     gait, and may also experience musculoskeletal pain. This pilot study 
     aims to investigate if the immediate experience of musculoskeletal 
     pain during gait influences kinematics and selective-motor-control in 
     individuals with spastic cerebral-palsy. Methods. Retrospective 
     treadmill-based gait-analysis data for 145 individuals with spastic 
     cerebral-palsy were screened. Participants were asked about 
     experiencing lower-extremity musculoskeletal pain immediately during 
     gait, with 26 individuals (18%) reporting this was the case 
     (pain-group; mean 11.55 ± 3.15 years, 
     Gross-Motor-Function-Classification-System levels I/II/III n = 
     5/13/8, Uni/bilateral involvement n = 11/15). Of the 77 individuals 
     who did not report any pain, a no-pain group (n = 26) was 
     individually matched. Kinematics were evaluated using the 
     Gait-Profile-Score and spatiotemporal parameters 
     (dimensionless-walking-speed, single-leg-support percentage and 
     step-time). Selective-motor-control was assessed using the 
     Walking-Dynamic-Motor-Control index. Findings. In the pain-group, 58% 
     reported experiencing pain in their more-involved leg, 8% in the 
     less-involved leg and 34% in both legs. Regarding the pain location, 
     38% of the pain-group reported experiencing pain in multiple 
     locations. On a more specific level, 35%, 46% and 54% reported pain 
     around the hip/thigh, knee/calf and ankle/ft, respectively. No 
     significant differences were observed between the pain and no-pain 
     groups for any of the outcome measures, in each leg or bilaterally. 
     Interpretation. No significant differences in kinematics and 
     selective-motor-control during gait were found between individuals 
     with spastic cerebral-palsy, with and without musculoskeletal pain. 
     This suggests that the individuals in this study may not present with 
     obvious antalgic gait patterns, which may relate to the pre-existing 
     altered kinematics and selective-motor-control.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), 
     the gold-standard method to quantify cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), 
     is not always feasible due to cost, access, and burden. The 
     usual-paced 400 m long distance corridor walk (LDCW), a measure of 
     mobility among older adults, may provide an alternate method to 
     assess CRF. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an 
     estimating equation to estimate VO2peak from average 400 m walking 
     speed (WS) among participants in the Study of Muscle, Mobility and 
     Aging (SOMMA). Methods. At baseline, women (58%) and men age 70 years 
     and older enrolled in SOMMA (N = 820, 76.2 ± 4.9 years, 86% 
     Non-Hispanic White) completed a 400 m LDCW (400 m WS = 400 
     m/completion time in seconds) and symptom-limited maximal CPET 
     (Modified Balke Protocol). VO2peak (mL/kg/min) was considered the 
     highest 30-second average oxygen consumption during CPET. Other 
     covariates included: age, sex, race, physical activity (7-day 
     wrist-worn accelerometer), physical function (Short Physical 
     Performance Battery, range 0-12), perceived physical fatigability 
     (Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale, range 0-50), and Borg Rating of 
     Perceived Exertion (RPE, range 6-20) at completion of the 400 m LDCW. 
     Stepwise linear regression was used. Internal validation was 
     completed using data-splitting method (70%; 30%). Results. Mean 
     VO2peak was 20.2 ± 4.8 mL/kg/min and mean 400 m WS was 1.06 ± 0.2 
     m/s. Each 0.05 m/s increment in 400 m WS was associated with a 0.40 
     mL/kg/min higher VO2peak after covariate adjustment. An estimating 
     equation including 400 m WS, age, sex, race, and RPE was developed. 
     Internal validation showed low overall bias (−0.26) and strong 
     correlation (r = 0.71) between predicted and measured VO2peak values. 
     Bland-Altman plot and regression analyses indicated predicted VO2peak 
     was an acceptable alternative, despite mean underestimation of 4.53 
     mL/kg/min among the highly fit. Conclusions. Usual-paced 400 m LDCW 
     strongly correlates with direct measures of CRF during CPET in older 
     adults with lower fitness and can be used to test both fitness and 
     function.]

     approach for enhancing performance and participation of children with 
     developmental disabilities (DD), but limited clinical trials examine 
     its effects on community participation. Aim. To evaluate whether 
     parent coaching, specifically using Occupational Performance Coaching 
     (OPC), enhances community participation among young children with DD. 
     Method and procedures. A pilot double-blind randomized controlled 
     trial was conducted. Parents of 50 children with DD (31 male, 19 
     female, mean age 4 years 10 months) were randomly assigned to the OPC 
     group (n = 25) or parent consultation group (n = 25). Each parent 
     received a maximum of eight coaching sessions or consultations. The 
     primary outcome was children's community participation as assessed 
     through parent-report measures at baseline, pre-intervention, 
     post-intervention, and an 8-week follow-up. Outcomes and results. 
     Both groups showed significant improvements in parent-identified, 
     goal-specific community participation after the intervention (mean 
     difference [MD]=2.26-2.56), and these improvements were sustained 
     during the follow-up. Despite a trend favoring parent coaching, the 
     group difference in the improvements was not evident (MD=0.18-0.28). 
     Both groups displayed positive improvements in children's overall 
     community involvement post-intervention (MD=0.32); however, the time 
     effects were not statistically significant. Conclusions and 
     implications. OPC, by coaching parents, could enhance goal-specific 
     community participation in children with DD, producing effects 
     similar to those achieved through parent consultation.]

     child with a neurodevelopmental disability influences parents' 
     well-being. However, little research has focused on the unique 
     experiences of parenting multiple children with neurodevelopmental 
     disabilities. We explored the unique experiences of parenting 
     multiple children with neurodevelopmental disabilities with a focus 
     on mothers' well-being and social participation. Methods. Ten mothers 
     who parent multiple children with neurodevelopmental disabilities 
     participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were analyzed 
     using a reflexive thematic approach. Results. Three themes were 
     identified: 'Knowledge is power' described positive influences of 
     enhanced disability knowledge and advocacy with each child who 
     experienced disability. 'Shifts in wellbeing' acknowledged these 
     mothers' exhaustion, decreased time for self-care, and invisible 
     work, yet also increased feelings of empowerment, purpose and empathy 
     for others. '(Dis)Connection and engagement with others' reflected 
     struggles of balancing responsibilities, social and community 
     participation, and experiences with isolation. Yet, mothers' also 
     experienced enhanced disability community and family connections, and 
     a sense of meaning and purpose. Conclusions and Implications. 
     Findings highlighted challenges, and many rewarding and unique 
     experiences of parenting multiple children with neurodevelopmental 
     disabilities. Health, education and social service practitioners are 
     encouraged to acknowledge parent's challenges, but also celebrate and 
     draw on families' strengths and knowledge.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Children with Developmental Coordination 
     Disorder (DCD) often (<87 %) experience postural control problems, 
     impacting all levels of the International Classification of 
     Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) including their daily 
     participation, self-esteem and mental health. Due to the 
     multisystemic nature of postural control, comprehensive therapy 
     should target all systems which is currently not the case. Highly 
     intensive therapy is effective and commonly used in pediatric 
     populations, but has not been explored yet to train postural control 
     in children with DCD. Aims. To investigate the effects of a highly 
     intensive functional balance therapy camp at all ICF levels in 
     children with DCD. Methods and procedures. The effects on postural 
     control, muscle activity, brain alterations, self-perceived 
     competence, self-identified goals, gross motor activities and 
     participation are evaluated. Participants are assessed pre- and 
     post-intervention, including a 3 months follow-up. Forty-eight 
     children with DCD, aged 6-12 years old, receive 40 h of comprehensive 
     balance training. This intervention is fun, individually tailored, 
     targets all postural control systems, implements different motor 
     learning strategies and includes both individual and group 
     activities. Conclusion. Novel insights into the effects of a highly 
     intensive comprehensive balance therapy camp designed for children 
     with DCD will be gained at all levels of the ICF.]

     AB: Abstract. The enigmatic benefits of acute limb ischemic 
     preconditioning (IP) in enhancing muscle force and exercise 
     performance have intrigued researchers. This study sought to unravel 
     the underlying mechanisms, focusing on increased neural drive and the 
     role of spinal excitability while excluding peripheral factors. 
     Soleus Hoffmann (H)-reflex /M-wave recruitment curves and 
     unpotentiated supramaximal responses were recorded before and after 
     IP or a low-pressure control intervention. Subsequently, the twitch 
     interpolation technique was applied during maximal voluntary 
     contractions to assess conventional parameters of neural output. 
     Following IP, there was an increase in both maximum normalized force 
     and voluntary activation (VA) for the plantar flexor group, with 
     negligible peripheral alterations. Greater benefits were observed in 
     participants with lower VA levels. Despite greater H-reflex gains, 
     soleus volitional (V)-wave and sEMG amplitudes remained unchanged. In 
     conclusion, IP improves muscle force via enhanced neural drive to the 
     muscles. This effect appears associated, at least in part, to reduced 
     presynaptic inhibition and/or increased motoneuron excitability. 
     Furthermore, the magnitude of the benefit is inversely proportional 
     to the skeletal muscle's functional reserve, making it particularly 
     noticeable in under-recruited muscles. These findings have 
     implications for the strategic application of the IP procedure across 
     diverse populations.]

     AB: Abstract. The term athlete does not currently have an agreed 
     definition or standardized use across the literature. We analyzed the 
     use of the term "athlete" amongst review studies specific to Anterior 
     Cruciate Ligament (ACL) rehabilitation to investigate if the term was 
     justified in its use. A comprehensive review of a database was 
     performed to identify review papers which used the term "athlete" in 
     the title, and which were related to ACL rehabilitation and 
     surveillance. These papers were analyzed and their source papers were 
     extracted for review. Twenty-eight review papers were identified. 
     Source studies were extracted and analyzed. After removal of 
     duplicates 223 source papers were identified. Despite using the term 
     "athlete" in the review study titles only 5/17 (10.7%) sufficiently 
     justified the use of this term. The term athlete was used in 117/223 
     (52.5%) of the source studies. Of those, 78/117 source studies 
     (66.7%) justified the term athlete. The remaining 39/117 (33.3%) 
     papers where participants were stated to be athletes, gave no 
     justification. The ambiguous use of the term athlete amongst 
     published studies highlights the need for a definition or 
     justification of the term to be used in studies. The lack of a 
     standard definition leads to the potential for studies to dilute high 
     quality data by the potentially differing rehabilitation requirements 
     and access to resources available to those with varying exercise 
     levels. The indiscriminate use of the term athlete could lead to 
     participants with widely ranging physical activity levels being 
     included in the same study, and being used to create clinical advice 
     for all. Advice could potentially vary across those of differing 
     physical activity levels.]

     AB: Abstract. Reward motivation is essential in shaping human 
     behavior and cognition. Both reward motivation and reward brain 
     circuits are altered in chronic pain conditions, including 
     fibromyalgia. In this study of fibromyalgia patients, we used a 
     data-driven independent component analysis (ICA) approach to 
     investigate how brain networks contribute to altered reward 
     processing. From females with fibromyalgia (N = 24) and female 
     healthy controls (N = 24), we acquired fMRI data while participants 
     performed a monetary incentive delay (MID) reward task. After 
     analyzing the task-based fMRI data using ICA to identify networks, we 
     analyzed 3 networks of interest: motor network (left), value-driven 
     attention network, and basal ganglia network. Then, we evaluated 
     correlation coefficients between each network timecourse versus a 
     task-based timecourse which modeled gain anticipation. Compared to 
     controls, the fibromyalgia cohort demonstrated significantly stronger 
     correlation between the left motor network timecourse and the gain 
     anticipation timecourse, indicating the left motor network was more 
     engaged with gain anticipation in fibromyalgia. In an exploratory 
     analysis, we compared motor network engagement during early versus 
     late phases of gain anticipation. Across cohorts, greater motor 
     network engagement (i.e. stronger correlation between network and 
     gain anticipation) occurred during the late timepoint, which 
     reflected enhanced motor preparation immediately prior to response. 
     Consistent with the main results, patients exhibited greater 
     engagement of the motor network during both early and late phases 
     compared with healthy controls. Visual-attention and basal ganglia 
     networks revealed similar engagement in the task across groups. As 
     indicated by post-hoc analyses, motor network engagement was 
     positively related to anxiety and negatively related to reward 
     responsiveness. In summary, we identified enhanced reward-task 
     related engagement of the motor network in fibromyalgia using a novel 
     data-driven ICA approach. Enhanced motor network engagement in 
     fibromyalgia may relate to impaired reward motivation, heightened 
     anxiety, and possibly to altered motor processing, such as restricted 
     movement or dysregulated motor planning.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Age-related voice changes are characterized 
     as breathy, weak and strained, and a deterioration in vocal function 
     in the elderly has been putatively linked to a reduced intensity of 
     speech. They contribute to undesirable voice changes known as 
     presbyphonia. These changes are caused by histological alterations in 
     the lamina propria of the vocal fold mucosa and atrophy of the 
     thyroarytenoid muscle, as well as by decreased respiratory support. 
     There are several clinical studies on presbylarynx dysphonia showing 
     the effectiveness of voice therapy. However, physiological changes of 
     the presbylarynx following voice therapy have not been verified. The 
     purpose of this prospective study was to demonstrate the clinical 
     effectiveness of voice therapy for rehabilitating presbylarynx 
     dysphonia, using vocal function assessments and thyroarytenoid 
     muscular activity detection on laryngeal electromyography (LEMG). 
     Methods. 10 patients who were diagnosed with aged vocal fold atrophy 
     from ages 60 to 87 years (mean age: 72 years) underwent approximately 
     12 weeks of voice therapy, mainly using forward-focused voice and 
     vocal resistance training. Stroboscopic examination, aerodynamic 
     assessment, acoustic analysis, Voice Handicap Index (VHI)-10, and 
     LEMG were performed pre- and post-voice therapy. Vocal fold vibratory 
     amplitude (VFVA) was measured by image analysis from the stroboscopic 
     examinations. Turns analysis during steady phonation on LEMG was also 
     assessed. Results. Maximum phonation time, subglottic pressure, 
     jitter, shimmer, VFVA, and VHI-10 significantly improved after voice 
     therapy. The number of turns per second on LEMG also significantly 
     increased. Conclusion. Our data suggest that voice therapy may 
     improve vocal function and thyroarytenoid muscle activity in patients 
     with aged vocal fold atrophy.]

     AB: ABSTRACT. Purpose: The first purpose of this study was to 
     investigate and compare the short-term effects after a semi-occluded 
     vocal tract (SOVT) therapy session consisting of straw phonation (SP) 
     in air or water on vocal fold vibration and supraglottic activity of 
     adult patients with voice disorders, visualized with 
     strobovideolaryngoscopy (SVL). The second purpose of this study was 
     to investigate and compare immediate changes in the patients' vocal 
     fold vibration and supraglottic activity during SP in air or water, 
     visualized with SVL. Methods: Twelve adult patients with voice 
     disorders (eight women and four men, mean age 52 years) were assigned 
     randomly to one of two study groups: SP in air or SP in water. 
     Immediately before and after a therapy session of 15 min, 
     participants underwent a rigid SVL to determine the short-term 
     effects of the SP session. At the posttherapy examination, flexible 
     SVL while performing SP was added to determine the effects occurring 
     during SP. The visual-perceptual ratings were performed blindly and 
     in random order by three laryngologists, using the Voice-Vibratory 
     Assessment with Laryngeal Imaging rating form for stroboscopy. 
     Results: Short-term effects after SP: After the SP-in-air session, 
     the supraglottic mediolateral compression decreased significantly. 
     The SP-in-water session led to significantly increased left 
     vibrational amplitude. Immediate effects during SP: During SP in air, 
     a significantly increased left amplitude and mucosal wave, and 
     significantly decreased mediolateral supraglottic activity, were 
     found. SP in water tended to decrease the vibrational amplitude 
     during performance of the task. A trend toward higher anteroposterior 
     supraglottic compression was observed during both SP in air and 
     water, being more prominent in the latter. Conclusion: SP in air led 
     to less false vocal fold adduction and consequently less 
     hyperfunction. The small increment in anteroposterior supraglottic 
     activity during SP in air and water might be related to epilarynx 
     narrowing, an economic phenomenon associated with SOVT exercises. The 
     effects on vibrational amplitude were rather ambiguous. The small 
     reduction in amplitude during SP in water is expected to diminish 
     vocal fold impact stress and therefore creates an ideal basis for 
     voice therapy. The increment in amplitude and mucosal wave during SP 
     in air might indicate insufficient supraglottic pressure to obtain 
     the favorable effects of semi-occlusion. Whether or not the rise in 
     amplitude after the SP-in-water session is due to voice efficiency or 
     voice fatigue remains unknown. Future larger-scale investigation in 
     subgroups of voice patients is needed to explore these hypotheses.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. The purpose of this scoping review was to 
     summarize key findings in the voice therapy adherence literature for 
     individuals with phonotraumatic lesions. The particular focus was to 
     identify how adherence has been defined and measured 
     (operationalization and criteria for successful adherence) and to 
     describe variables which were found to have a positive, neutral, or 
     negative relationship with adherence to voice therapy. Methods. Data 
     were identified and charted using the PRISMA-ScR protocol via 
     searches of CINAHL, PsycINFO, Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. 
     Results. Literature mining revealed that adherence is rarely defined 
     but is usually operationalized. "Successful completion of therapy" 
     was the most common operationalization. Most variables studied in 
     this field have been found to have no relationship with adherence. An 
     incidental finding was that, most frequently, researchers have 
     repeatedly studied variables which have already been documented to 
     have no relationship with adherence. Conclusion. Research into voice 
     therapy adherence is still emerging, and few if any variables have 
     been identified which are strongly associated with adherence to voice 
     therapy for people with phonotraumatic lesions. Inspiration for 
     future research may be drawn from other disciplines, which point to 
     relationship variables as central to the adherence process. 
     Examination of such variables is currently underrepresented in the 
     voice therapy literature; we suggest this and other gaps for pursuit 
     in future research.]

     AB: Summary. Purpose. To verify the efficiency of thermotherapy 
     perceptively and acoustically with hot vapor in the treatment of 
     acute laryngitis. Methods. This is a pre and post test 
     quasi-experimental study without a control group, approved by the 
     ethics committee. Its sample counted with 65 singers - 37 females 
     (56.9%) and 28 males (43.1%), mean age 33.7 years (±7.9) years, 
     nonsmokers, with dysphonia due to acute laryngitis. They were 
     submitted to videolaryngostroboscopy and perceptive-acoustic 
     assessment of the voice before and 30 minutes after applying the 
     inhalation of hot vapor. The appropriate statistical tests were used, 
     adopting the significance level lower than 0.05. Results. In the 
     acoustic assessment, there was a statistically significant 
     improvement in jitter and shimmer for vowels A and E, P < 0.001. The 
     F0 assessed separately per sex, as it presented a significant 
     difference, P < 0.001. The women's F0 results before and after the 
     heat were higher than the men's. In the analysis of the acoustic 
     results based on harmonics-to-noise ratio and normalized noise 
     energy, there was significant improvement after the heat. All the 
     mean values increased after the heat. There was a statistically 
     significant decrease in the parameters related to the 
     perceptive-auditory assessment for G (grade of hoarseness), R 
     (roughness), B (breathiness), and S (strain). Of the 47 singers that 
     scored 2 for G, 28 (59.6%) reduced it to 1 after the heat, P < 0.001. 
     All the 45 that scored 2 for R reduced it to 1, P = 0.011. Of the 8 
     who scored 2 for B, 6 (75%) reduced it to 1, P = 0.020. All the 28 
     singers that scored 1 for S reduced it to 0, P < 0.001. Only for A 
     (asthenia), there was no significant improvement, P = 0.513. The 
     results of the videolaryngostroboscopy revealed a statistically 
     significant difference in all parameters analyzed, such as hyperemia, 
     edema, muco-undulatory movement, and glottal coaptation. Conclusion. 
     The thermotherapy with using humid heat, provide symptomatic benefits 
     in the treatment of dysphonia caused by laryngitis, demonstrating 
     that the hyperthermoterapy is a potential auxiliary therapeutic 
     resource for the treatment of acute dysphonia due to laryngitis since 
     the intervention with the technique proposed increased the voice 
     quality. It is suggested that this method be used in speech-language 
     clinical practice and that new studies be conducted with stronger 
     designs for its efficacy to be confirmed.]

     AB: Summary. Objectives. The Japanese herbal medicine kyoseihatekigan 
     (KHG) has been used to alleviate the symptoms of croaky voice and 
     globus hystericus, and each of its components has anti-inflammatory 
     and antioxidant effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these 
     beneficial actions of KHG on the vocal folds remain largely unknown. 
     We examined the effects of KHG on rat vocal fold wound healing and 
     assessed its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Study 
     Design. Animal model. Methods. The vocal folds of Sprague-Dawley rats 
     were unilaterally injured under endoscopy. Rats were divided into 
     three groups based on KHG dosing from pre injury day 4 to post injury 
     day 3: 0 mg/kg/day (sham group), 500 mg/kg/day (1% KHG group) and 
     1000 mg/kg/day (2% KHG group). Histologic changes were examined to 
     assess the degree of inflammation and oxidative stress at day 3, and 
     fibrosis at day 56. In addition, gene expression related to 
     pro-inflammatory cytokines and transforming growth factor-beta1 
     (TGF-β1) signaling was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase 
     chain reaction (qPCR). Results. Histologic analysis showed that the 
     1% and 2% KHG treatments significantly decreased cell infiltration 
     and the 4-hydroxy-2-nonenalx-immunopositive area, and increased 
     hyaluronic acid at day 3. Both KHG treatments significantly decreased 
     fibrosis at day 56. qPCR revealed that mRNA of interleukin-1β and 
     cyclooxygenase-2 were significantly suppressed at day 1 and TGF-β1 
     mRNA was significantly downregulated at day 5 in both KHG groups. 
     Conclusions. The current findings suggest that KHG has 
     anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in the early phase of vocal 
     fold wound healing, which can lead to better wound healing with less 
     scar formation.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. The purpose of the study was to examine 
     gender-related differences in benign vocal fold mass treatment. 
     Methods. Adult patient with vocal fold mass diagnosed on 
     strobovideolaryngoscopy examination were reviewed retrospectively. 
     Patient demographics, past medical history, laboratory data, and 
     examination findings during the initial visit and at follow-up were 
     collected. The duration of voice therapy and the prevalence of 
     surgery were analyzed for males and females. Results. One hundred and 
     fifty-eight patients (76 male and 82 female) were included. The 
     percentage of professional voice users differed significantly between 
     males and females. Vocal folds of females had a higher percent of 
     reactive masses present. Females were also more likely to have a 
     pseudocyst. Vocal folds of males showed a higher percent of masses of 
     unspecified category on strobovideolaryngoscopy examination. A 
     significantly greater proportion of females had abnormal high shimmer 
     values, and abnormal low maximum phonation time; and a significantly 
     greater proportion of females compared to males chose to participate 
     in voice therapy. The average number of voice therapy sessions for 
     males did not differ, nor did duration of voice therapy. A similar 
     proportion of males and females underwent surgical mass excision. The 
     treatment plan completed differed significantly between males and 
     females with a higher percentage of males choosing to receive no 
     treatment. For 45.54% of males and 59.70% of females the treatment 
     plan consisted of voice therapy only. For 33.33% of males and 37.31% 
     of females, the treatment plan included both voice therapy and 
     surgery. Although gender was the strongest predictor for 
     participation in voice therapy, professional voice uses also 
     predicted participation in voice therapy in both men and women 
     significantly. Professional singing in particular was not a 
     significant predictor for participation in voice therapy. Males were 
     significantly more likely than females to be lost to follow-up before 
     treatment outcome could be assessed. Conclusion. More females than 
     males were found to have pseudocysts while more males than females 
     had unspecified masses. Females and professional voice users were 
     more willing than males to utilize voice therapy. No difference was 
     found between males and females who decided to have surgery. The best 
     treatment regimen for vocal fold mass is a combination of voice 
     therapy and surgery, when necessary, but gender-specific differences 
     merit further research as well as reconsideration of therapy 
     approaches and strategies to optimize patient compliance.]

     AB: Summary. The epidemic of opioid use in the United States has been 
     declared a national public health crisis due to the rapid increase in 
     drug overdose mortality. Physician overprescribing has been 
     identified as one of many contributing factors, with most patients 
     receiving excess opioid pain medication. Furthermore, there is a 
     significant correlation between prescribed opioid dosage and 
     mortality. Postoperative pain is a well-recognized clinical problem, 
     but little has been done to advance or standardize pain management 
     protocols. The purpose of this study was to determine the expected 
     postoperative pain severity and quantity of opioid analgesic required 
     for adequate pain management after laryngeal surgery. Methods. Adult 
     voice center patients who had recently undergone laryngeal surgery 
     were included in this retrospective review. Tylenol #3 had been 
     prescribed for all patients for pain management and they had been 
     instructed to take additional over-the-counter acetaminophen as 
     needed. In the senior author's (RTS) practice, patients are asked 
     routinely to report pain severity and analgesic use during 
     postoperative visits. All patients who had this information available 
     were included in the cohort. Opioid medication consumed, 
     over-the-counter medication consumed, and pain level (scale of 0-10 
     with 10 being most severe) were analyzed over the first week 
     postoperatively. Results. There were 43 patients (19 male, 24 female) 
     included in the retrospective cohort (average age = 46.8 ± 18.6, 
     range = 18-82). Procedures performed included vocal fold mass 
     excision (48.8%), type I thyroplasty (27.9%), laser vaporization of 
     vascular lesions (11.6%), laser stenosis resection (9.3%), and VF 
     medialization injection with abdominal fat harvest (7.0%). Overall, 
     voice surgery patients reported mild to moderate pain (2.1-4.7 out of 
     10). An average of 13.2 ± 2.8 T3 tablets were prescribed for pain 
     management (range = 10-20), and no patient required more T3 tablets 
     than the number provided. Sixteen patients (37.2%) supplemented or 
     substituted their T3 medication for it with OTC acetaminophen. No 
     patients used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 
     supplemental pain management. Consumption of both T3 pain medication 
     (r = 0.444) and OTC acetaminophen (r = 0.274) was correlated 
     significantly with postoperative pain severity (P < 0.001). When 
     stratified by type of surgical procedure performed, one-way ANOVA (F 
     = 2.749, P = 0.043) and post-hoc Games-Howell test revealed that the 
     patients who underwent type I thyroplasty reported a significantly 
     higher (P = 0.041) pain severity score than patients who underwent 
     vocal fold mass excision (4.7 versus 2.1, respectively). No 
     significant differences in pain severity existed between other 
     procedures (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences between 
     type of procedure performed for number of T3 tablets prescribed, 
     number of T3 tablets taken, or number of OTC tablets taken (P > 
     0.05). Younger age was correlated significantly with a higher number 
     of OTC tablets consumed (r = -0.316, P = 0.039). Women consumed more 
     OTC pain medications than men. Conclusions. Most patients in this 
     study reported mild to moderate postoperative pain. Adequate pain 
     management was achieved using less pain medication tablets than the 
     number prescribed. Type I thyroplasty was associated with more severe 
     pain than other surgeries. Women used more OTC pain medications than 
     men with no significant difference in reported pain level.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. Glottoplasty using an angiolytic laser is an 
     option for the surgical treatment of sulcus vocalis. In this study, 
     we sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes of using a 532-nm diode 
     laser in sulcus vocalis patients and to identify predictive factors 
     of improved voice outcomes after angiolytic laser-assisted 
     glottoplasty. Methods. A total of 66 patients with sulcus vocalis who 
     underwent laser-assisted glottoplasty with a 532-nm diode laser were 
     included in this study. Results. 3 months after surgery, GRBAS 
     scores, patient-reported outcome measures, fundamental frequency 
     (F0), jitter percent, and noise-to-harmonic ratio decreased 
     significantly, while cepstral peak prominence (CPP) of vowel and 
     sentence production increased. Patients with auditory-perceptual 
     improvements showed greater improvement in the Voice Handicap Index 
     (VHI) scores, F0, and CPP of vowel and sentence production compared 
     to those with no improvement. While young male patients with 
     preoperatively high F0 were predicted to have favorable outcomes, the 
     type of sulcus vocalis was not predictive of treatment outcomes. 
     Patients treated with lower laser power showed better improvement in 
     the VHI scores postoperatively than those who received higher laser 
     power per vocal fold. Combined injection laryngoplasty with laser 
     glottoplasty was effective in lowering the F0, especially in male 
     patients with high F0. Conclusion. A 532-nm diode laser is useful for 
     treating sulcus vocalis. Young male patients and individuals with 
     preoperatively high F0 showed better voice outcomes after laser 
     glottoplasty. Laser power and combined injection laryngoplasty are 
     considered to affect improvement in the VHI and lowering F0 after 
     laser glottoplasty in sulcus vocalis.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Diversifying voice therapy strategies is 
     critical to get children and adolescents to adhere to the therapeutic 
     process. Purpose. To investigate the face-to-face and distance 
     playful strategies have been used for vocal health education and 
     voice therapy in children and adolescents. Methods.An integrative 
     literature review was carried out based on the recommendations of the 
     Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes 
     (PRISMA). A search for full texts was conducted on the Virtual Health 
     Library, Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO) and PuBMed 
     databases using the following descriptors, and their corresponding 
     Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): voice (voz); voice quality 
     (qualidade da voz); dysphonia (disfonia); voice disorders 
     (distúrbios da fala); voice training (treinamento da voz); 
     telemedicine (telemedicina); therapeutics (terapêutica); health 
     promotion (promoção da saúde); group practice (prática de grupo); 
     recreation therapy (terapia recreacional); child (criança); 
     preschool (pré-escolar) and adolescent (adolescente). Results. After 
     full reading of the studies, 15 articles were included and 
     categorized into the following topics: face-to-face and distance 
     playful strategies for voice therapy in children; playful strategies 
     with gamification for education and for voice therapy in children; 
     and vocal health educational actions in children. Conclusion. The 
     study found a higher number of studies that carried out educational 
     actions and playful strategies, while fewer studies were related to 
     the production of materials, gamification and online services for 
     voice therapy in children. Given the proven benefits of this strategy 
     for children, further studies focusing on the development and 
     application of playful strategies, such as the use of gamification, 
     should be conducted in order to stimulate the skills and adherence of 
     this population to therapy.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Voice disorders are a common 
     communication disorder in children. Behavioral voice therapy is 
     recommended by both Otolaryngologists and Speech-Language 
     Pathologists as a first-line approach for treatment of benign vocal 
     fold lesions that affect children in large numbers. However, the role 
     of cognitive mechanisms critical to voice therapy have not yet been 
     explored. Objective. This proof-of-concept study aims to provide 
     preliminary data on the potential relation between cognitive 
     abilities and behavioral results of voice therapy for children with 
     benign phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. Methods. Six children (4;05 
     -9;02 years) diagnosed with vocal fold nodules completed a battery of 
     cognitive tests from the NEuroPSYchological (NEPSY-II) Assessment and 
     a standard course of "Adventures in Voice" therapy. Recordings pre 
     and post intervention were analyzed acoustically using the Cepstral 
     Spectral Index of Dysphonia (CSID) and perceptually using visual 
     analog scales (VAS) for severity and resonance separately. Raw and 
     age-corrected scaled scores from the NEPSY-II were then examined for 
     their possible relation to voice outcomes. Results. Multiple 
     cognitive functions correlated with voice outcomes. Raw score 
     measures for. Design: Fluency, Inhibition, Fingertip Tapping, and 
     Narrative Memory correlated favorably with all voice outcome 
     measures. Age correlated with all NEPSY-II raw scores and perceptual 
     voice outcome measures. Scaled scores for Auditory Attention,. 
     Design: Fluency, Fingertip Tapping (Dominant hand), and Narrative 
     Memory correlated with all voice outcome measures. Conclusion. 
     Results suggest that there is merit to further investigation of the 
     relation between cognitive skills and their development and voice 
     treatment outcomes in children with benign phonotraumatic lesions. 
     Future studies with larger samples will build on present findings.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. This study evaluated the effectiveness of 
     vocal hygiene education with resonant voice therapy for school-aged 
     children with vocal nodules. Study Design. A pre-test/post-test 
     control group design was employed. Methods. Seventeen children aged 
     between 6 and 9 years old with vocal nodules were randomly assigned 
     to three groups: a treatment group, a placebo group and a control 
     group. Children in the treatment group (n = 7) received six 
     consecutive, weekly, one-hour sessions of vocal hygiene education 
     with resonant voice therapy. Children in the placebo group (n = 5) 
     received six consecutive, weekly, one-hour sessions on presentation 
     skills training. Children in the control group (n = 5) did not 
     receive any form of treatment. Subjective outcome measures included 
     auditory-perceptual evaluation of overall dysphonia severity, the 
     Pediatric Voice Handicap Index (pVHI) and the Children's Voice 
     Handicap Index-10 (CVHI-10). Objective outcome measures included 
     acoustic analysis of fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer and 
     noise-to-harmonic ratio. Results and Conclusions. Significant 
     improvements in perceptual ratings of overall dysphonia severity 
     levels and pVHI scores were found in the treatment group. No 
     significant changes in acoustic measures and CVHI-10 scores were 
     noted in any of the three groups. Interestingly, an improvement in 
     perceptual overall dysphonia severity levels at post-evaluation was 
     observed in the no treatment control group.]

     English articles comparing VTE and EV results in laryngectomized 
     patients were included. Results. We provided 15 articles for a total 
     of 1085 laryngectomized patients undergoing voice rehabilitation, of 
     which 869 (80.1%) were treated with voice prosthesis while 216 
     (19.9%) to esophageal speech. Pooled VHI outcomes showed a 
     significantly better score for the TEV group than EV one 
     (31.93±12.11 versus 35.39±20.6; P = 0.003), but no significant 
     difference was recorded at VrQoL (8.27±5.98 versus 9.27±2.02; P = 
     0.19). Conclusion. TEV and EV are both effective procedures in voice 
     rehabilitation after laryngectomy. Although TEV allows for 
     significantly better speech performance, it does not necessarily 
     correlate with a high VrQoL.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) with 
     voice prosthesis (VP) is considered the gold standard in vocal 
     rehabilitation of total laryngectomized patients, for generating 
     better speech intelligibility and good vocal result. The aspects of 
     aging that may be related to the success of this method of 
     rehabilitation are rarely discussed in the literature. Objective. To 
     describe the factors that influence the rehabilitation outcome of the 
     total laryngectomized older patients with voice prosthesis. Methods. 
     A retrospective cohort study enrolled in the Head and Neck Cancer 
     Surgery Section of the Brazilian National Cancer Institute. Secondary 
     data were collected through physical and electronic medical records 
     of patients undergoing vocal rehabilitation using tracheoesophageal 
     prosthesis, from 2006 to 2019. Descriptive analysis presented the 
     distribution of the demographic and clinical characteristics of this 
     population. Results. Thirty patients rehabilitated with VP over 70 
     years old (mean age: 73.7 years), of which 93.3% were male. Married 
     (73.3%), with low education (70%) and had a tumor of size T4a (60%). 
     Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed in 66.7% of patients, 16.7% to 
     previous radical radiotherapy, Complication rate was 53.3%, (68.7% 
     granuloma and 18.7% shunt enlargement). All patients with shunt 
     enlargement removed the prosthesis, whereas the prevalence of removal 
     among those patients without complications was 14.3%. Logistic 
     regression indicated that secondary TEP had 96% less chance of 
     failure for phonation than primary TEP. Conclusions. Patients with 
     more complications are more likely to have phonation issues and to 
     remove the prosthesis. Older patients with larger tumors and who 
     underwent salvage laryngectomy or were submitted to a primary 
     puncture seem to be more likely to have complications and/or 
     aphonia.]

     in patients with dysarthria. Method. Thirteen patients were 
     classified according to dysarthria type and divided into functional 
     profiles (hypofunctional, hyperfunctional, and mixed). Assessments of 
     maximum phonation time of /a/, glottal source parameters, 
     electroglottography, and nasometry were performed. Results were 
     compared between groups using ANOVA and Tukey posthoc tests. Results. 
     The highest fundamental frequency differed significantly between 
     groups, with the hyperfunctional profile showing higher values than 
     the other participant groups. Reductions in the maximum phonation 
     time of /a/ and alterations in acoustic glottal source parameters and 
     electroglottography measures were observed in all groups, with no 
     significant differences between them. The remaining measures did not 
     differ between groups. Conclusion. The maximum phonation times for 
     /a/ were reduced in all participant groups, suggesting air escape 
     during phonation. The presence of alterations in several glottal 
     source parameters in all participant groups is indicative of noise, 
     tremor, and vocal instability. Lastly, the high fundamental frequency 
     in patients with a hyperfunctional profile reinforces the presence of 
     vocal instability. These findings suggest that, although the 
     characteristics observed in the assessments were consistent with 
     expectations of patients with dysarthria, it is difficult to perform 
     a differential diagnosis of this condition based on acoustic and 
     physiological parameters alone.]

     Library, Embase, and CINAHL) searches and hand-searching identified 
     studies that evaluated treatment approaches for spasmodic dysphonia 
     which included pre and post outcome data. Results. A total of 4714 
     articles were retrieved from searching databases; 1165 were 
     duplicates. Titles and abstracts of 3549 were screened, with 171 
     being selected for full-text review. During full-text review, 101 
     articles were deemed suitable for inclusion. An additional 24 
     articles were identified as suitable for inclusion through 
     hand-searching of reference lists. Data was extracted from 125 
     studies, identifying 220 outcome measures. As per the World Health 
     Organization's International Classification of Functioning (ICF), the 
     majority measured body functions (n = 212, 96%). Outcomes that 
     explored communication and participation in everyday life and 
     attitudes towards communication (ie, activity and participation 
     domains) were infrequent (n = 8; 4%). Quality of life, a paradigm 
     outside of the scope of the ICF, was also captured by four outcome 
     measures. No instruments evaluating communication partners' 
     perspectives were identified. Conclusions. Currently there is no 
     unified approach to the measurement of outcomes in SD treatment 
     research. Development and implementation of a core outcome set is 
     recommended to facilitate improved understanding of the efficacy of 
     current and new treatment options.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. This report aims to perform a preliminary 
     evaluation of the role of taping in the improvement of phonasthenia 
     among professional voice users. The larynx is a vital organ but also 
     a work instrument for many people. Prevention of erroneous use of the 
     vocal mechanism is essential for an optimal voice performance. 
     Methods. Nineteen singers complaining voice fatigue underwent taping 
     application in peri-laryngeal areas of the anterior neck for 10 days. 
     Taping effects were estimated by the evaluation of voice analysis 
     parameters (jitter, shimmer, noise to harmonic ratio and singing 
     power ratio) performed in M1 and M2 mechanisms with PRAAT software 
     before and after treatment. In addition, a subjective assessment of 
     phonasthenia was performed using a self-administrated questionnaire. 
     Results. Statistically significant reduction of Jitter% in M1 (P = 
     0.021) was reported at the end of treatment; also, an improvement of 
     NHR in M2 was found immediately after the application (P = 0.012) and 
     after 10 days (P = 0.002). These outcomes suggest possible beneficial 
     effects of laryngeal taping on relieving voice fatigue, and therefore 
     improving voice quality. Self-assessment results are consistent with 
     this finding. Conclusion. Since the application of muscular taping in 
     phoniatrics is still in its early stage, further studies and in 
     particular a standardized protocol of application, could facilitate 
     the spread of this technique, also offering help in comparing 
     results.]

     voice problems. Objective. The aim of this study was to examine 
     trends over a period of time of the prevalence of voice problems and 
     reported stress in Finnish school buildings. Study Design.School 
     buildings from different parts of the country were studied for ten 
     years using a similar questionnaire (N = 1721). Five schools 
     participated before and after the remediation of an indoor air 
     problem in the school buildings (n = 315). Results. In the pilot 
     study (2007-2008), the reported work-related stress was on a very low 
     level (3%) and the prevalence of hoarseness was 10%. After the 
     economic crisis in 2008, the stress was observed to have increased. 
     During the follow-up (2008-2017), the reported stress had continued 
     to increase and in the latest surveys it was 21% and the prevalence 
     of hoarseness 34%. Indoor air factors correlated significantly with 
     hoarseness even when controlling for age, gender, owning pets and job 
     satisfaction in a logistic regression model. In the school buildings 
     where the remediation of the building was completed, the prevalence 
     of hoarseness decreased but the level of stress increased. In 
     general, the proportion of respondents reporting stress was lower 
     than the proportion of respondents with hoarseness. Additionally, the 
     reported stress also correlated with factors other than health in the 
     education branch, especially economic resources and major changes in 
     the core curriculum. Conclusion. Hoarseness and work-related stress 
     have, to a large extent, different risk factors. Over time, the 
     proportion of individuals with stress has been at a lower level than 
     the proportion of respondents with voice problems; hence, we conclude 
     that it is quite unlikely that stress would be a causative risk 
     factor for hoarseness. We recommend that irritant dust and gases 
     should be reduced from the work environment of teachers to enable 
     recovery from hoarseness and other voice problems. Coping with 
     work-related stress should be alleviated with other measures.]

     AB: Summary. Our study sought to show the relation between dysphonia 
     and personality traits as explained by Gray's theories. Personality 
     traits were analyzed in a patient group of 141 patients who showed 
     functional and congenital voice disorders. The results were compared 
     to the control group made up of 99 vocally healthy individuals. Their 
     objective voice quality was measured by using the Dysphonia Severity 
     Index, Voice Handicap level was measured using the VHI-10, and a 
     perceptive analysis was conducted with a listening jury. The results 
     showed significant differences in Introversion and Neuroticism and a 
     greater tendency for activating the behavioral inhibition system in 
     the patient group. Such an influence was also evident in voice 
     quality measures. The results were similar to specialized 
     literature.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. To examine the effect of traditional voice 
     therapy and cognitive therapy on the voice and client-wellbeing 
     outcomes in adults with functional voice disorders (FVD). Methods. A 
     systematic review of English articles was conducted using Medline 
     (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (Ebsco), The Cochrane Central 
     Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsychInfo (Ebsco) and 
     Speechbite from inception to current date. Additional studies were 
     identified through bibliographies and authors were contacted when 
     further information was required from an article. All study designs 
     were included with pretest/posttest outcome measures related to 
     voice. Independent extraction of studies was completed by three 
     authors using predefined data fields and quality assessment tools. 
     Results. Outcomes of 23 studies (2 RCTs and 21 cohort or case 
     studies) are summarised using a narrative style due to heterogeneity 
     of interventions and outcome scales used. Overall research quality of 
     included studies was low, with many cohort and case studies lacking 
     controls, blinding and robust outcome measures. Conclusions. There 
     are some benefits to pairing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with 
     traditional voice therapy for FVD including improved voice quality, 
     psychosocial wellbeing and prevention of relapse. It is feasible to 
     train speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in CBT-enhanced voice 
     therapy. Further high-quality research is needed, however, to guide 
     the clinical implementation of CBT for the management of FVD.]

     AB: Summary. Introduction. Dysphonia and laryngeal problems are some 
     of the manifestations of the COVID-19 pandemic due to respiratory 
     disease as a primary effect of COVID-19. The aim of the present study 
     was to investigate voice quality and vocal tract discomfort symptoms 
     in patients with COVID-19. Materials and methods. Forty-four COVID-19 
     patients with a mean age of 49.61 ± 16.48 years and 44 healthy 
     subjects with a mean age of 48.52 ± 13.8 years participated in the 
     study. The voice quality of the participants was evaluated using 
     auditory-perceptual evaluation with the Grade, Roughness, 
     Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS) scale. The vocal tract 
     discomfort symptoms of the participants were assessed using the 
     Persian version of the VTD scale. Results. Patients with COVID-19 had 
     higher scores in all items of the GRBAS, including grade, roughness, 
     breathiness, asthenia, and strain, than healthy subjects, and these 
     differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Among the 
     GRBAS parameters, grade had the highest effect size and asthenia had 
     the lowest effect size in both speech tasks. The COVID-19 patients 
     had a greater frequency of vocal tract discomfort symptoms than 
     healthy subjects in all items of the VTDp scale and these differences 
     were statistically significant (P < 0.05) in the following items: 
     burning, tight, dry, pain, sore, irritable, and lump in the throat. 
     The most and the least effect size in frequency of the vocal tract 
     discomfort symptoms were related to dry (d = 1.502) and tickling (d = 
     0.157), respectively. Also, COVID-19 patients had more significant 
     severity in all items of the VTDp scale except tight and tickling. 
     The most and the least effect size in severity of the vocal tract 
     discomfort symptoms was related to dry (d = 1.416) and tickling (d = 
     0.152), respectively. Conclusion. The present study suggests that 
     COVID-19 patients have more deviations in voice quality than healthy 
     subjects. Moreover, mild vocal tract discomfort is prevalent in 
     patients with COVID-19, and patients have more frequent and severe 
     physical discomforts of the vocal tract than healthy subjects.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. This paper's purpose is to provide a resource 
     for clinicians and researchers of select voice-related 
     patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) available in the English 
     language. Method. A systematic search for voice-related PROMs was 
     conducted between September 2020 and July 17, 2021. Databases 
     included APA PsychInfo, Nursing and Allied Health Source, MEDLINE via 
     the EBSCO interface, and Science Direct. Reference lists for 
     PROMs-related articles were mined for reference to PROMs protocols. 
     Results. Thirty voice-related PROMs were identified and categorized 
     as either developed primarily for use in the clinic (n = 12), 
     developed primarily for use in a specific research study (n = 6), or 
     translated into English for publication (n = 12). Twelve PROMs were 
     summarized: Aging Voice Index, Disease Specific Self-Efficacy in 
     Spasmodic Dysphonia, Evaluation of the Ability to Sing Easily, 
     Evaluating Voice Disability - Quality of Life Questionnaire, Glottal 
     Function Index, Linear Analog Scale of Assessment of Voice Quality, 
     Quality of Life in Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis, Speech 
     Disability Questionnaire, Trans Woman Voice Questionnaire, Vocal Cord 
     Dysfunction Questionnaire, Vocal Fatigue Index, and the Vocal Tract 
     Discomfort Scale. Conclusion. The PROMs can be categorized into 
     English-language voice-related PROMs developed primarily for clinical 
     use, English-language PROMs developed primarily for research use, and 
     English-language PROMs translated into English. The extent of 
     reliability and validity testing completed varies in the PROMs 
     developed primarily for clinical use. A PROM's psychometric 
     properties as well as the language in which the PROM was tested, 
     should guide clinicians and researchers as they consider which 
     instrument(s) to use.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. To assess the validity and reliability of 
     the Korean version of the reflux symptom score (K-RSS). Materials and 
     Methods. The English version of the RSS was translated into Korean 
     and completed by 77 people (44 and 33 people in the patient group and 
     control group, respectively). They completed the K-RSS (K-RSS-1) and 
     reflux symptom index (RSI) questionnaires and answered questions 
     about age, sex, underlying disease, smoking history, and alcohol and 
     coffee consumption. They completed the K-RSS once more (K-RSS-2) 
     after 1 - 2 weeks. Internal consistency was evaluated using 
     Cronbach's α and test-retest reliability using the intraclass 
     correlation coefficient (ICC). External validity was evaluated using 
     the Spearman rank test between the RSI and K-RSS. The Mann-Whitney U 
     test was used to assess internal validity by comparing the K-RSS-1 
     scores between the patient and control groups. Results. The most 
     common symptoms were globus sensation, throat clearing, and throat 
     pain. The K-RSS reported high internal consistency (α = 0.894). The 
     ICC for the total score was 0.883, indicating excellent test-retest 
     reliability. According to the Spearman analysis, there was a 
     significant correlation between the total score of the K-RSS and that 
     of the RSI (rs = 0.902; P < 0.001), demonstrating strong external 
     validity. Furthermore, the patient group showed significantly higher 
     values than the control group in all K-RSS scores, suggesting high 
     internal validity. Conclusion. The K-RSS is a patient-reported 
     outcome questionnaire with excellent criterion-referenced validity 
     and ideal reliability.]

     AB: Summary. This narrative review describes the development and use 
     of patient-reported outcomes over 30 years, focusing on the Knee 
     injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). KOOS is a 
     five-subscale patient-reported instrument intended for use from the 
     time of knee injury to the development of osteoarthritis. Numerous 
     studies have confirmed that the psychometric properties of the KOOS 
     and its short-form KOOS-12 are acceptable. More recent research has 
     focused on the use and interpretation of KOOS scores in clinical 
     trials using thresholds, such as minimal important differences, 
     patient-acceptable symptom states, and treatment failure. As an 
     indication of KOOS's popularity, the total 3854 PubMed results for 
     KOOS have increased exponentially since the first KOOS paper was 
     published 25 years ago and now seem to have plateaued at around 650 
     annually. The selected articles are not based on a systematic search, 
     but on the author's own publications, reading, and literature search 
     that grew organically from that.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. The gait speed test is one of the most 
     widely used mobility assessments for older adults. We conducted a 
     systematic review to evaluate and compare the measurement properties 
     of the usual and fast gait speed tests in community-dwelling older 
     adults. Methods. Three databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE and 
     CINAHL. Peer-reviewed articles evaluating the gait speed test's 
     measurement properties or interpretability in community-dwelling 
     older adults were included. The Consensus-based Standards for the 
     selection of health Measurement Instruments guidelines were followed 
     for data synthesis and quality assessment. Results. Ninety-five 
     articles met our inclusion criteria, with 79 evaluating a measurement 
     property and 16 reporting on interpretability. There was sufficient 
     reliability for both tests, with intraclass correlation coefficients 
     (ICC) generally ranging from 0.72 to 0.98, but overall quality of 
     evidence was low. For convergent/discriminant validity, an overall 
     sufficient rating with moderate quality of evidence was found for 
     both tests. Concurrent validity of the usual gait speed test was 
     sufficient (ICCs = 0.79-0.93 with longer distances) with moderate 
     quality of evidence; however, there were insufficient results for the 
     fast gait speed test (e.g. low agreement with longer distances) 
     supported by high-quality studies. Responsiveness was only evaluated 
     in three articles, with low quality of evidence. Conclusion. Findings 
     from this review demonstrated evidence in support of the reliability 
     and validity of the usual and fast gait speed tests in 
     community-dwelling older adults. However, future validation studies 
     should employ rigorous methodology and evaluate the tests' 
     responsiveness.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
     (COPD) is a leading public health concern globally. Interdisciplinary 
     pulmonary rehabilitation programs exist and should ideally consider 
     nutritional health impacts since the nutritional status of COPD 
     patients is often compromised. However, little is known about the 
     role of dietary counseling in COPD management. Research question. 
     Does providing tailored dietary advice to adult patients with COPD 
     improve outcomes? Study design and methods. We conducted a systematic 
     review. The following electronic databases and registrars were used: 
     MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and 
     ClinicalTrials.gov. The original search was conducted in June 2021 
     with an updated search conducted on February 21, 2024. Validity and 
     bias assessments were completed. Results. We selected 14 articles for 
     inclusion. Multiple outcomes were considered including functional, 
     body composition, nutritional intake, cost analyses, quality of life, 
     and others. The most common measured outcomes were quality of life 
     and the 6 min walk test. A number of interventions were used with 
     most interventions being interdisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation 
     packages where nutrition counseling was one component. A number of 
     interventions showed positive results but there tended to be 
     inconsistency. Interpretation. Evidence shows that various 
     interventions appear to improve outcomes, but it is difficult to 
     determine if improvements are due to nutritional intervention 
     specifically or a rehabilitation program as a whole. More specific 
     randomized controlled trials should be completed regarding tailored 
     nutritional counseling and therapy in adults with COPD to determine 
     the benefits attributable to nutritional interventions.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) plays an 
     important role in the management of symptomatic patients with chronic 
     respiratory diseases (CRD). While studies have investigated the 
     feasibility and efficacy of virtual PR (VPR), it is important to 
     understand the experiences of patients and healthcare providers 
     (HCPs) during the rapid digital health transformation that occurred 
     in the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives. To explore the experiences and 
     perspectives of patients and HCPs who participated in VPR during the 
     pandemic. Methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with CRD 
     patients and HCPs. This study used a qualitative descriptive approach 
     and a team-based inductive thematic analysis. Results. Participants 
     included 11 HCPs (7 female; 29-55 years) and 19 CRD patients (11 
     male; 62-83 years; 15 COPD, 4 COPD/ILD). Three major themes and 10 
     subthemes were identified: i) the pandemic response: a 'trial by 
     fire' (navigating uncertainty, emotional impact of change, shifting 
     practice amid complexity); ii) beyond the emergency: navigating a 
     'new normal' (eligibility and assessment for VPR, virtual exercise, 
     virtual education and resources, clinical supervision and patient 
     safety); and iii) care beyond boundaries: the implications of using 
     technology for PR (benefits and limitations of technology, 
     psychosocial implications, VPR in the future). Conclusion. The pivot 
     to VPR was acknowledged as positive by both patients and HCPs 
     although both groups were mindful of the implementation challenges. 
     These findings provide insight into the experience of HCPs and 
     patients in introducing VPR in response to the pandemic and will 
     inform future implementation of VPR for individuals with CRD.]

     life (HR-QoL), work productivity and activity impairment and 
     associated factors among patients with idiopathic inflammatory 
     myopathy (IIM). Methods. This was an observational, cross-sectional 
     study. The 189 ambulatory patients with IIM were recruited from May 
     2019 to May 2022. HR-QoL was measured by the European Quality of Life 
     5-Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire. The Work Productivity and Activity 
     Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire was used to evaluate work 
     productivity and activity impairment. The IIM-related parameters were 
     assessed by the 8-item Manual Muscle Test (MMT-8), Myositis Disease 
     Activity Assessment visual analogue scale (MYOACT), Myositis Damage 
     Index (MDI), Disease Activity Score (DAS) and Physician/. Patient: 
     Global Assessment (PhGA/PtGA). Quantile regression and ordinal 
     logistic regression were performed to identify the factors, 
     considering EQ-5D or WPAI scores as dependent variables, 
     respectively. Results. Of the 189 IIM patients enrolled, 60% had DM, 
     13% had PM and 27% had clinical amyopathic DM. The median EQ-5D score 
     was 1.00 (95% CI 0.73, 1.00), 28% were employed and 45% of overall 
     work was impaired due to health problems. EQ-5D values were 
     positively associated with MMT-8 and negatively with MYOACT, DAS, 
     MDI-global and PhGA/PtGA. For the WPAI, activity impairment was 
     associated with a lower MMT-8 score, older onset age and higher PhGA 
     only in 25th-75th percentile. Increased PtGA was associated with 
     increased activity and overall working productivity impairment in 
     most quantiles (P<0.05). Conclusion. Multiple disease characteristics 
     were associated with reduced HR-QoL or working productivity 
     impairment in patients with IIM, especially for PtGA.]

     AB: Abstract. The efficacy of a smartphone app intervention 
     (BabyMind©) in facilitating mind-mindedness was investigated in a 
     randomized controlled trial, assigning mothers and their 6-month-olds 
     (N = 152; 72 girls, 146 White) to intervention or active control 
     conditions. Mothers who had received the BabyMind© app intervention 
     scored higher for appropriate (d = .61, 95% CI .28, .94) and lower 
     for non-attuned (d = −.55, 95% CI −.92, −.18) mind-related 
     comments at follow-up (age 12 months), compared with their control 
     group counterparts. Adjusting for missing data did not alter this 
     pattern of findings. Mothers' baseline parental reflective 
     functioning did not moderate these relations. Results are discussed 
     in terms of the benefits of early intervention and exploring the 
     efficacy of the app in more diverse populations.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Adults with intellectual disabilities (IDs) 
     are susceptible to multiple health risk behaviours such as alcohol 
     consumption, smoking, low physical activity, sedentary behaviour and 
     poor diet. Lifestyle modification interventions can prevent or reduce 
     negative health consequences caused by these behaviours. We aim to 
     determine the effectiveness of lifestyle modification interventions 
     and their components in targeting health risk behaviours in adults 
     with IDs. Methods. A systematic review and meta-analysis were 
     conducted. Electronic databases, clinical trial registries, grey 
     literature and citations of systematic reviews and included studies 
     were searched in January 2021 (updated February 2022). Randomised 
     controlled trials and non-randomised controlled trials targeting 
     alcohol consumption, smoking, low physical activity, sedentary 
     behaviours and poor diet in adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with ID were 
     included. Meta-analysis was conducted at the intervention level 
     (pairwise and network meta-analysis) and the component-level 
     (component network meta-analysis). Studies were coded using Michie's 
     19-item theory coding scheme and 94-item behaviour change taxonomies. 
     Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) 
     Version 2 and Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions 
     (ROBINS-I). The study involved a patient and public involvement (PPI) 
     group, including people with lived experience, who contributed 
     extensively by shaping the methodology, providing valuable insights 
     in interpreting results and organising of dissemination events. 
     Results. Our literature search identified 12 180 articles, of which 
     80 studies with 4805 participants were included in the review. The 
     complexity of lifestyle modification intervention was dismantled by 
     identifying six core components that influenced outcomes. 
     Interventions targeting single or multiple health risk behaviours 
     could have a single or combination of multiple core-components. 
     Interventions (2 RCTS; 4 non-RCTs; 228 participants) targeting 
     alcohol consumption and smoking behaviour were effective but based on 
     limited evidence. Similarly, interventions targeting low physical 
     activity only (16 RCTs; 17 non-RCTs; 1413 participants) or multiple 
     behaviours (low physical activity only, sedentary behaviours and poor 
     diet) (17 RCTs; 24 non-RCTs; 3164 participants) yielded mixed 
     effectiveness in outcomes. Most interventions targeting low physical 
     activity only or multiple behaviours generated positive effects on 
     various outcomes while some interventions led to no change or 
     worsened outcomes, which could be attributed to the presence of a 
     single core-component or a combination of similar core components in 
     interventions. The intervention-level meta-analysis for weight 
     management outcomes showed that none of the interventions were 
     associated with a statistically significant change in outcomes when 
     compared with treatment-as-usual and each other. Interventions with 
     core-components combination of energy deficit diet, aerobic exercise 
     and behaviour change techniques showed the highest weight loss [mean 
     difference (MD) = −3.61, 95% credible interval (CrI) −9.68 to 
     1.95] and those with core-components combination dietary advice and 
     aerobic exercise showed a weight gain (MD 0.94, 95% CrI −3.93 to 
     4.91). Similar findings were found with the component network 
     meta-analysis for which additional components were identified. Most 
     studies had a high and moderate risk of bias. Various theories and 
     behaviour change techniques were used in intervention development and 
     adaptation. Conclusion. Our systematic review is the first to 
     comprehensively explore lifestyle modification interventions 
     targeting a range of single and multiple health risk behaviours in 
     adults with ID, co-produced with people with lived experience. It has 
     practical implications for future research as it highlights the 
     importance of mixed-methods research in understanding lifestyle 
     modification interventions and the need for population-specific 
     improvements in the field (e.g. tailored interventions, development 
     of evaluation instruments or tools, use of rigorous research 
     methodologies and comprehensive reporting frameworks). Wide 
     dissemination of related knowledge and the involvement of PPI groups, 
     including people with lived experience, will help future researchers 
     design interventions that consider the unique needs, desires and 
     abilities of people with ID.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Stigma towards people with intellectual 
     disability affects various aspects of their lives, including access 
     to employment, housing, health and social care services. Furthermore, 
     this stigma reduces their social opportunities and is even reflected 
     in laws that diminish their autonomy. Due to the practical 
     significance of this issue, the aim of this research is to explore 
     for the first time the social stigma associated with intellectual 
     disability in a representative sample of the Spanish population. 
     Method. A cross-sectional quantitative descriptive study was 
     conducted, involving a representative sample of the population (N = 
     2746). The study includes descriptive analyses and hierarchical 
     regressions to examine various dimensions of stigma, such as 
     attitudes, attributions, and intentions of social distance. Results. 
     Medium levels of stigma are found regarding attitudes and 
     attributions towards people with intellectual disability, while 
     levels are medium-low concerning the intention of social distance. 
     The most reliable indicators of stigma across its various dimensions 
     encompass attitudes, attributions, and the intention of social 
     distance. Factors that contribute to lower stigma include knowing 
     someone with an intellectual disability, being willing to discuss 
     intellectual disability with an acquaintance who has it and having a 
     progressive political ideology. People with intellectual disability 
     show more negative attributions towards themselves. Living with a 
     person with an intellectual disability is another predictor of more 
     stigmatising attitudes, but less intention of social distance. 
     Results are mixed regarding age, gender, and educational level. 
     Conclusion. Combating the stigmatisation of people with intellectual 
     disabilities must include comprehensive actions to address attitudes, 
     attributions and behavioural intentions. Public policies, such as 
     national campaigns and programmes, should include contact with and 
     open conversations about intellectual disability, and sensitivity to 
     sociodemographic variables.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Individuals with intellectual disabilities 
     (IDs) often present deficiencies in motor, balance and postural 
     control. On the other hand, the practice of physical activity and 
     dance usually reduces these deficiencies. Therefore, in this study, 
     we aimed to compare the control of the centre of pressure (COP) in 
     people with Down syndrome (DS) or other causes of ID in relation to 
     people without disabilities and to observe the influence of vision 
     and the practice of dance. Methods. This cross-sectional study 
     analyses the COP in a static standing position with open and closed 
     eyes in four study groups. A total of 273 people were recruited (80 
     adults without ID, 46 adults with DS, 120 adults with other causes of 
     ID and 27 dancers with DS). Results. A greater area of oscillation 
     and path of the COP was observed in the participants with ID compared 
     with the participants without ID, especially in the sway area of the 
     COP. The oscillation speed of the COP was also higher. When analysing 
     the displacement of the COP, anteroposterior and mediolateral 
     components, there were also differences, except when comparing the 
     group of dancers with DS with respect to the group without ID. The 
     visual condition only influenced the group of participants without 
     disabilities. Conclusions. The results of our study show that there 
     is a less efficient static postural control in people with ID, as 
     greater displacements were observed in the COP of the participants 
     with ID. The differences in some specific variables that analyse the 
     displacement of the COP were smaller when comparing the group of 
     dancers with DS and the individuals without ID.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Altered gait patterns and reduced walking 
     speed are commonly reported in adults with Down syndrome (DS). 
     Research on the effects of DS-specific exercise programmes on adults 
     with DS is lacking. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was 
     to evaluate the changes in gait deviations and walking speed in 
     adults with DS after a DS-specific exercise programme. Methods. 
     Twenty participants underwent a 12-week, DS-specific exercise 
     programme in a telehealth format. Before and after the intervention, 
     gait deviations were assessed with the Ranchos Los Amigos 
     Observational Gait Analysis form, and comfortable walking speed was 
     evaluated with the 4-m walk test. Results. We observed increased 
     comfortable walking speed and reduced gait deviations in the whole 
     gait cycle in adults with DS after the intervention. There were fewer 
     gait deviations during single-leg stance and swing-limb advancement 
     and at the hip, knee and ankle joints after the 12-week exercise 
     programme. Conclusions. Gait speed and observable gait impairments in 
     adults with DS significantly improved following a 12-week telehealth

     evaluate gait parameters in people with intellectual disability (ID) 
     and without intellectual disability (WID) in two different walking 
     conditions [single task vs. dual task (DT)]. A secondary aim was to 
     evaluate the dual-task cost (DTC) that the DT causes in each group. 
     Methods. A total of 119 participants joined in this study: 56 ID (30 
     men) and 63 WID (30 men). The OptoGait system was used to assess 
     gait. In addition, Witty photocells were added to assess gait under 
     the DT condition. Results. Single support time was lower for 
     participants with ID (P < 0.01), while double support time was higher 
     (P < 0.05). All coefficients of variation for gait parameters were 
     higher in participants with ID. Additionally, changes in gait were 
     observed in both groups during the DT condition compared with the 
     single-task condition. These changes were larger for participants 
     with ID in step length, double support time and gait speed (P < 
     0.001), resulting in a higher DTC in these variables in the ID group 
     (P < 0.01). Conclusions. Both groups reduced gait performance in the 
     DT condition. However, greater gait variability occurred in the ID 
     group. In addition, DTC was higher for the ID group in all variables 
     analysed. Therefore, people with ID show worse gait performance 
     during a DT than people WID.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Sleep-wake problems and depressive symptoms 
     are common in people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) and are 
     thought to be related to the unstable sleep-wake rhythm in this 
     population. Previously, we showed that after increasing environmental 
     light exposure, mid-sleep and sleep onset advanced, and mood improved 
     over a period of 14 weeks after installing environmental dynamic 
     light installations in the living room of people with IDs. We invited 
     participants of that short-term study to take part in the current 
     study on sleep-wake rhythm, mood and behaviour in older adults with 
     IDs 1 year after installing environmental dynamic light installations 
     in the common living rooms of six group homes. Methods. A pre-post 
     study was performed from October 2017 to February 2019. We included 
     45 participants (63.5 ± 8.5 years, 67% female) from six group home 
     facilities who provided data at baseline (9, 4 and 1 weeks prior to 
     installing light installations), short term (3, 7 and 14 weeks after 
     installing light installations) and 1 year (54 weeks after installing 
     light installations). Wrist activity was measured with actigraphy 
     (GENEActiv) to derive the primary outcome of interdaily stability of 
     sleep-wake rhythms as well as sleep estimates. Mood was measured with 
     the Anxiety, Depression and Mood Scale. Behaviour was measured with 
     the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist. Results. One year after installing 
     dynamic lighting, we did not find a change in interdaily stability. 
     Total sleep time decreased (β = −25.40 min; confidence interval: 
     −10.99, −39.82), and sleep onset time was delayed (β = 25.63 
     min; confidence interval: 11.18, 40.08). No effect on mood or 
     behaviour was found.Conclusions. We did not find a change in 
     sleep-wake rhythm, mood or behaviour in older persons with IDs living 
     in care facilities 1 year after installing the light. We did find 
     evidence for a long-term effect on sleep duration and sleep timing. 
     The results have to be interpreted with care as the current study had 
     a limited number of participants. The need for more research on the 
     long-term effects of enhancing environmental light in ID settings is 
     evident.]

     repeated-measures design in general surgery unit of a training and 
     research hospital. Forty-two women with newly diagnosed breast cancer 
     were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The 
     intervention group received nurse-led supportive care program for 8 
     weeks, 4 weeks in face-to-face sessions and 4 weeks through phone 
     sessions. The control group received only routine treatment. The 
     women in both groups completed the EORTC-QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) 
     Quality of Life questionnaires at baseline and ninth week. Results. 
     There was a significant increase in the mean global health status and

     intervention group compared to the women in the control group in the 
     ninth week compared to the baseline. The women in the intervention 
     group had a lower mean symptom status score in the ninth week than 
     the women in the control group and there was a statistically 
     significant difference in the change in the mean scores of the groups

     PMRE twice a day for 8 weeks. Patients in the control group received 
     routine care at the clinic without additional intervention. For data 
     analysis, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, 
     and chi-square test were used. Results. The sociodemographic 
     attributes of patients within both the intervention and control 
     groups exhibited comparability. However, notable distinctions emerged 
     in the PSQI Global sleep score and PSQI subdimension scores, 
     encompassing sleep latency and duration, subjective sleep quality, 
     habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction 
     between the two groups. The study found a notable difference in 
     scores between the patients in the intervention group and those in 
     the control group. The patients who received the intervention had 
     significantly lower scores (P < .001). Conclusion. The study revealed 
     that PMRE was beneficial in improving sleep quality in cancer 
     patients undergoing chemotherapy who had poor sleep quality. 
     Implications for Nursing Practice. Oncology nurses may consider using 
     PMRE to improve the sleep quality of cancer patients receiving

     AB: Abstract. Although evidence regarding the effects of 
     high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on mental health has 
     increased in recent years, there is still no consensus regarding the 
     effects of HIIT on the symptoms of depression and anxiety in a 
     healthy population. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to 
     investigate the effects of HIIT on depressive and/or anxiety symptoms 
     in healthy individuals. The following four databases were searched: 
     PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and PsycINFO. Only randomized clinical trials 
     (RCTs) were included. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis 
     based on standardized mean difference (SMD). The risk of bias was 
     assessed using the RoB 2.0 tool, and the certainty of the evidence 
     was evaluated based on recommendations GRADE. Eight RCTs evaluating 
     471 participants (81% female) were considered eligible for inclusion. 
     The results of the meta-analysis showed that HIIT-based interventions 
     had no significant effect on reducing anxiety (SMD = −0.17; 95% CI: 
     −0.53, 0.19; p = 0.27) and depressive symptoms (SMD = −0.38; 95% 
     CI: −1.06, 0.30; p = 0.17) compared with the passive control group. 
     In conclusion, HIIT does not improve symptoms of depression and 
     anxiety in healthy individuals. This finding is based on evidence of 
     very low certainty. Therefore, the evidence is still not consistent 
     enough to support HIIT as a viable strategy to reduce both outcomes 
     because of the limited number of included studies and the overall 
     quality of evidence.]

     AB: Abstract. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are serious 
     and potentially career-ending. Reconstruction surgery and extended 
     rehabilitation typically follow, but some athletes never attain the 
     same level of sport performance. The psychosocial experiences of 
     athletes who sustain ACL injuries and their cognitive appraisal, 
     emotional and behavioral responses to the injury, and reconstruction 
     require further attention during the different recovery phases. The 
     aim is to explore these psychosocial experiences, social support 
     needs and sources thereof of competitive athletes who sustained 
     unilateral ACL ruptures and underwent reconstruction surgery. 
     Semi-structured interviews with six competitive rugby players (M age: 
     22.3 ± 2.92 years), elicited information at seven time-points. We 
     analyzed the qualitative information through thematic analysis. Five 
     common themes emerged: (1) cognitive appraisal, (2) emotional 
     responses (negative and positive affective responses), (3) behavioral 
     responses, (4) social support needs and sources thereof, and (5) 
     adversity-induced identity expansion (athletic and person-centered 
     identities). In-vivo quotes gave a rich description of the athletes' 
     experiences throughout the "long, long journey" to return-to-sport. 
     These findings may sensitize and assist sports healthcare 
     professionals, coaches, teammates, family, and friends to explore 
     various psychosocial experiences throughout the injury and recovery 
     period. Phase-appropriate psychosocial support or referral to sport 
     psychology services is recommended to enhance the recovery process, 
     improve long-term physical and mental health, and subsequent 
     performance.]

     AB: Abstract. We investigated the effects of far-infrared radiation 
     (FIR) lamp therapy on changes in muscle damage and performance 
     parameters following six sets of 15-min Loughborough intermittent 
     shuttle test (LIST), a simulated soccer match. Twenty-four elite 
     female soccer players (20-24 y) were assigned into FIR or sham 
     treatment group (n = 12/group). The participants received a 60-min 
     FIR or sham treatment (30 min per muscle) over knee extensors (KE) 
     and flexors (KF) at 2, 25, 49, 73, and 97 h post-LIST. Maximal 
     voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) torque and muscle soreness of 
     the KE and KF, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity as muscle damage 
     markers, and several performance parameters including countermovement 
     jump (CMJ) and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (YYIR1) were 
     measured before and 1, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post-LIST. Changes 
     in the measures were compared between groups by a mixed-design 
     two-way ANOVA. The running distance covered during LIST and changes 
     in the measures at 1-h post-LIST (before the treatment) were similar 
     (p = 0.118-0.371) between groups. Changes in muscle damage markers at 
     24-120 h post-LIST were smaller (p < 0.05, η2 = 0.208-0.467) for the 
     FIR (e.g. MVC-KE torque decrease at 48-h post-LIST: −1 ± 2%, peak 
     KE soreness: 16 ± 10 mm, peak CK: 172 ± 42 IU/L) than sham group 
     (−11 ± 9%, 33 ± 7 mm, 466 ± 220 IU/L, respectively). Performance 
     parameters recovered faster (p < 0.05, η2 = 0.142-0.308) to baseline 
     for the FIR (e.g. decreases at 48-h post-LIST; CMJ: 0 ± 1%, YYIR1: 0 
     ± 1%) than sham group (−6 ± 2%, −9 ± 6%, respectively). These 
     results suggest that the FIR lamp therapy was effective for enhancing 
     recovery from a soccer match.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) commonly 
     affect the proximal biceps femoris long head (BFlh) musculotendinous 
     junction. Biomechanical modeling suggests narrow proximal BFlh 
     aponeuroses and large muscle-to-aponeurosis width ratios increase 
     localized tissue strains and presumably risk of HSI. This study aimed 
     to determine if BFlh muscle and proximal aponeurosis geometry 
     differed between limbs with and without a history of HSI. Methods. 
     Twenty-six recreationally active males with (n = 13) and without (n = 
     13) a history of unilateral HSI in the last 24 months underwent 
     magnetic resonance imaging of both thighs. BFlh muscle and proximal 
     aponeurosis cross-sectional areas, length, volume, and interface area 
     between muscle and aponeurosis were extracted. Previously injured 
     limbs were compared to uninjured contralateral and control limbs for 
     discrete variables and ratios, and along the relative length of 
     tissues using statistical parametric mapping. Results. Previously 
     injured limbs displayed significantly smaller muscle-to-aponeurosis 
     volume ratios (p = 0.029, Wilcoxon effect size (ES) = 0.43) and 
     larger proximal BFlh aponeurosis volumes (p = 0.019, ES = 0.46) than 
     control limbs with no history of HSI. No significant differences were 
     found between previously injured and uninjured contralateral limbs 
     for any outcome measure (p = 0.216-1.000, ES = 0.01-0.36). 
     Conclusions. Aponeurosis geometry differed between limbs with and 
     without a history of HSI. The significantly larger BFlh proximal 
     aponeuroses and smaller muscle-to-aponeurosis volume ratios in 
     previously injured limbs could alter the strain experienced in muscle 
     adjacent to the musculotendinous junction during active lengthening. 
     Future research is required to determine if geometric differences 
     influence the risk of re-injury and whether they can be altered via 
     targeted training.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. The potential consequences of repeated 
     concussions in sport are well documented. However, it remains unclear 
     whether the cumulative impact of sports-related concussions differs 
     between different contact sports. Therefore, the aim of the current 
     study was to investigate the cumulative effects of sports-related 
     concussions on clinical and neurocognitive health in different 
     contact sports. Materials and Methods. In a prospective multicenter 
     study, we examined 507 (74 females) active professional athletes 
     between 18 and 40 years of age from five different contact sports 
     (soccer, handball, American football, basketball, and ice hockey). 
     Data collection involved concussion history, clinical symptom 
     evaluation, neurocognitive assessment, and the collection of other 
     sports-related information. Composite scores were built for clinical 
     symptoms (such as neck pain and balance disturbances) and for 
     neurocognitive symptoms (such as memory and attention impairments). 
     Results. Athletes having suffered 3+ concussions in the past showed 
     disproportionally higher clinical symptom severity than athletes with 
     less than three concussions across all sports. The level of clinical 
     symptom burden in athletes with 3+ concussions indicated mild 
     impairment. The number of past concussions did not affect 
     neurocognitive performance. Discussion. Repeated sports-related 
     concussions appear to have a cumulative impact on clinical-but not 
     cognitive-symptom severity. Although clinical symptom burden in 
     athletes with 3+ concussions in the past was not alarmingly high yet 
     in our sample, increased caution should be advised at this point. 
     Despite few exceptions, results are similar for different contact 
     sports, suggesting a similar multidisciplinary concussion management 
     across all types of sport.]

     AB: Abstract. The efficacy of interrupting prolonged sitting may be 
     influenced by muscle activity patterns. This study examined the 
     effects of interrupting prolonged sitting time with different muscle 
     activity patterns on continuously monitored postprandial glycemic 
     response. Eighteen overweight and obese men (21.0 ± 1.2 years; 28.8 
     ± 2.2 kg/m2) participated in this randomized four-arm crossover 
     study, including uninterrupted sitting for 8.5 h (SIT) and 
     interruptions in sitting with matched energy expenditure and duration 
     but varying muscle activity: 30-min walking at 4 km/h (ONE), sitting 
     with 3-min walking at 4 km/h (WALK) or squatting (SQUAT) every 45 min 
     for 10 times. Net incremental area under the curve (netiAUC) for 
     glucose was compared between conditions. Quadriceps, hamstring, and 
     gluteal muscles electromyogram (EMG) patterns including averaged 
     muscle EMG amplitude (aEMG) and EMG activity duration were used to 
     predict the effects on glucose netiAUC. Compared with SIT (10.2 
     mmol/L/h [95%CI 6.3 to 11.7]), glucose netiAUC was lower during 
     sitting interrupted with any countermeasure (ONE 9.2 mmol/L/h [8.0 to 
     10.4], WALK 7.9 mmol/L/h [6.4 to 9.3], and SQUAT 7.9 mmol/L/h [6.4 to 
     9.3], all p < 0.05). Furthermore, WALK and SQUAT resulted in a lower 
     glucose netiAUC compared with ONE (both p < 0.05). Only increased 
     aEMG in quadriceps (−0.383 mmol/L/h [−0.581 to −0.184], p < 
     0.001) and gluteal muscles (−0.322 mmol/L/h [−0.593 to −0.051], 
     p = 0.022) was associated with a reduction in postprandial glycemic 
     response. Collectively, short, frequent walking or squatting breaks 
     effectively enhance glycemic control in overweight and obese men 
     compared to a single bout of walking within prolonged sitting. These 
     superior benefits seem to be associated with increased muscle 
     activity intensity in the targeted muscle groups during frequent 
     transitions from sitting to activity.]

     AB: Abstract. The effects of a 12-week gait retraining program on the 
     adaptation of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and muscle-tendon unit 
     (MTU) were investigated. 26 runners with a rearfoot strike pattern 
     (RFS) were randomly assigned to one of two groups: gait retraining 
     (GR) or control group (CON). MG ultrasound images, marker positions, 
     and ground reaction forces (GRF) were collected twice during 9 km/h 
     of treadmill running before and after the intervention. Ankle 
     kinetics and the MG and MTU behavior and dynamics were quantified. 
     Runners in the GR performed gradual 12-week gait retraining 
     transitioning to a forefoot strike pattern. After 12-week, (1) ten 
     participants in each group completed the training; eight participants 
     in GR transitioned to non-RFS with reduced foot strike angles; (2) MG 
     fascicle contraction length and velocity significantly decreased 
     after the intervention for both groups, whereas MG forces increased 
     after intervention for both groups; (3) significant increases in MTU 
     stretching length for GR and peak MTU recoiling velocity for both 
     groups were observed after the intervention, respectively; (4) no 
     significant difference was found for all parameters of the series 
     elastic element. Gait retraining might potentially influence the MG 
     to operate at lower fascicle contraction lengths and velocities and 
     produce greater peak forces. The gait retraining had no effect on SEE 
     behavior and dynamics but did impact MTU, suggesting that the 
     training was insufficient to induce mechanical loading changes on SEE 
     behavior and dynamics.]

     AB: Abstract. While ample research has shown that sport injuries are 
     associated with poor psychological status, scant attention has been 
     given to changes in injured athletes' psychological status over the 
     full course of recovery and return to sport. The aim of the present 
     study was to prospectively investigate potential changes in injured 
     athletes' psychological status across four phases of recovery and 
     return to sport. A total of 38 severely injured adult competitive 
     athletes (58% female; mean age 24.1 ± 7.18 years) participated in 
     this prospective weekly investigation (n = 319 observations). 
     Athletes' were asked to indicate their current phase of recovery or 
     return to sport (acute care, rehabilitation, adapted training, or 
     full return to sport) after which they responded to visual analog 
     scales assessing post-injury psychological status, including: 
     perceived pain (frequency and intensity), emotions (positive and 
     negative), anxiety (cognitive and physiological), motivation, 
     self-efficacy, and satisfaction. During the acute care phase, 
     participants showed higher scores of perceived pain, and 
     physiological anxiety compared to the other phases. During the 
     adapted training phase, amotivation was higher than in the acute care 
     phase, and self-efficacy was lower than in other phases. At full 
     return to sport, athletes showed less perceived pain, cognitive 
     anxiety, and more satisfaction than during other phases. The present 
     study provides a deeper prospective understanding of changes in 
     athlete's psychological status over the course of injury recovery and 
     return to sport and highlight the importance of monitoring 
     psychological status.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. In patients with chronic obstructive 
     pulmonary disease (COPD), loneliness and social isolation are 
     associated with increased morbidity and decreased mobility, 
     self-reliance, and health-related quality of life. Social support has 
     been shown to improve these outcomes. Aims. This cross-sectional 
     study aimed to investigate the level of experienced social support 
     and the clinical outcomes associated with inadequate social support 
     among patients with COPD with a resident loved one. Methods. Level of 
     social support was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study - Social 
     Support Survey (MOS-SSS) in patients with COPD with a resident loved 
     one. Patients were sub-grouped into adequate or inadequate social 
     support. Multiple clinical outcomes were assessed, including lung 
     function, degree of dyspnoea, health status, symptoms of anxiety and 
     depression, the degree of care dependency, functional status, and 
     mobility. Results. The study included 191 Dutch patients with COPD 
     (53.4% men, age: 65.6 ± 8.9 years, FEV1: 47.3 ± 17.7% predicted). 
     Eighteen percent of the patients reported inadequate social support. 
     Patients with inadequate social support reported a significantly 
     symptom severity of COPD (p = 0.004), a higher care dependency level 
     (p = 0.04) and a higher level of depression (p = 0.004) compared to 
     patients with adequate social support. Other traits were comparable 
     for both groups. Conclusion. Patients with COPD with a resident loved 
     one who perceive an inadequate level of social support are more 
     likely to report a higher impact of COPD, a higher care dependency 
     and symptoms of depression. Other characteristics are comparable with 
     patients who perceive adequate social support.]

     AB: Summary. Objectives. The validity and reliability of the 
     psychological assessment of auditory perceptions, as typified by the 
     grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain (GRBAS) scale, 
     have been widely recognized. However, due to their subjective nature, 
     inter- and intra-examiner reliability are unavoidable. In this study, 
     we aimed to add objectivity to the GRBAS scale using artificial 
     intelligence and to compare the accuracy of two methods-one based on 
     Google's TensorFlow and another based on Apple's Core ML. Methods. 
     The GRBAS scale of 1,377 vowel samples was evaluated and used as 
     training data to create a machine learning model. We used TensorFlow 
     and Apple's Create ML to create two machine learning models and 
     examined the difference in their accuracies for classifying the 
     severity of pathological Voice data based on the GRBAS scale. 
     Results. Absolute comparisons are difficult to make because of the 
     difference in methods; however, both training models could 
     objectively evaluate GRBAS scales and were statistically correlated 
     in G and B. Conclusion. While TensorFlow requires creation of a 
     training model from scratch, Create ML is a relatively easy way to 
     create a training model for voice by adding training data for GRBAS 
     scales to an existing training model for sounds. Although the data 
     handling and learning methods are different, both models performed 
     well. Findings from this study could be used for medical screening 
     purposes, and there is the potential to change the clinical approach 
     to voice diagnostics in the future.]

     and individuals with typical voices. Methods. RFF values were 
     calculated from the speech acoustics of individuals with globus 
     syndrome (n = 12), individuals with MTDg (n = 12), and age- and 
     sex-matched controls with typical voices (n = 24). An analysis of 
     variance was performed on RFF values to assess the effect of group. 
     Results. There was no statistically significant effect of group on 
     RFF values, with similar values for individuals with globus syndrome, 
     individuals with MTDg, and control participants. Conclusions. These 
     results suggest that individuals with these disorders do not appear 
     to possess paralaryngeal muscle tension in a locus and/or manner that 
     directly impacts voice production.]

     AB: Summary. Background. Simulation is a safe, supported, and 
     accessible learning method for students to gain skills and 
     experience, especially in difficult to access range of practice areas 
     such as voice. Objective. The study aimed to explore change in 
     students' perceptions of knowledge, confidence, anxiety, and clinical 
     readiness for assessment and management of an adult with a voice 
     disorder after participation in simulation-based learning activities. 
     Methods. Participants (N = 113) were students enrolled in a mandatory 
     course dedicated to the voice and voice disorders. Students completed 
     32 hours of academic coursework which included lectures and tutorials 
     and two 30-minute simulation-based learning activities with a 
     standardized patient playing the role of an adult with a voice 
     disorder. The impact of the simulation-based learning activities on 
     student perceptions of their knowledge, confidence, anxiety, and 
     clinical readiness for work within the area of voice were surveyed at 
     three time points: (1) pre lectures, (2) post lectures but pre 
     simulation, and (3) post simulation. Change across time was analyzed 
     using repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni 
     adjustment. Results. All students perceived significant (P ≤ 0.001) 
     positive changes in knowledge and confidence across time points for 
     all activities, except for writing an assessment report. Anxiety 
     related to the management of a client with a voice disorder 
     fluctuated significantly (P ≤ 0.001) throughout the program. 
     Overall, the majority (>90%) of students agreed or strongly agreed 
     that the simulation-based learning activities were useful and helped 
     them to develop clinical skills, apply content taught in lectures,

     AB: Summary. Objective. This study aims to (1) determine the cut-off 
     values of the Global Severity of vocal deviation on the Visual Analog 
     Scale (VAS) from the numerical scale ratings, and (2) identify the 
     cut-off values according to different degrees of vocal deviation used 
     by Voice-Specialized Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP). Study 
     design. Prospective study. Methods. The auditory-perceptual 
     assessment was performed by four SLPs using two protocols with 
     different scales: the VAS and the 4-point numerical scale. Among the 
     211 voices analyzed, 147 corresponded to female participants, and 64 
     corresponded to males, plus 20% repeated voice samples. Participants 
     were between 19 and 60 years. All of them were asked to count from 1 
     to 10 and were recorded in a sound-proof booth. For both protocols, 
     the judges scored the overall severity. One SLP was excluded from the 
     analysis due to inconsistency during the perceptual assessment. 
     Results. For normal voice and mild deviations, overall severity 
     cut-off score on the VAS was 21. For mild-moderate deviations, the 
     cut-off was 55; and 81 points for moderate and severe deviations. The 
     Area Under the Curve values correspond to 0.725, 0.905 and 0.851, 
     respectively. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the VAS is a good 
     instrument to be used during voice assessment performed by Chilean 
     SLPs. However, it evidences possible differences in voice analysis 
     perception with other cut-off scores performed in other countries, 
     which can be compared to future studies.]

     AB: Summary. Introduction. Obesity has tripled since 1975 and affects 
     health across many domains. Increasing body mass index increases the 
     risk to the obese subject of many non-communicable diseases. The 
     study evaluated the perceptive, aerodynamic, and acoustic parameters 
     that characterize the voice of the obese population. Methodology. 
     Eighty adult subjects (40 participants in each obese and control 
     group) aged 18-50 years were enrolled. The perceptual voice analysis 
     was performed using the Consensus Auditory Perceptual Evaluation of 
     Voice. The aerodynamic and acoustic voice analyses were performed 
     using the MIR Spiro lab instrument and Doctor's Speech software. A 
     digital stopwatch was also used to measure maximum phonation time. 
     Results. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference 
     (P-value <0.05 and t value >2) between two groups on acoustic 
     parameters, specifically Normalized noise energy and fundamental 
     frequency tremor (F0 tremor). Normalized noise energy and fundamental 
     frequency tremor were greater in the obese group. Moreover, maximum 
     phonation time and expiratory reserve volume were significantly 
     reduced in the obese group. Discussion and Conclusion. Results of the 
     present study showed poor voice quality and reduced expiratory 
     reserve volume in obese individuals. This could be credited to the 
     adverse effects of accrued adipose on the functioning of the 
     laryngeal and respiratory systems. Increasing body mass index 
     escalates the risk to the obese subjects of many non-communicable 
     diseases.]

     AB: Summary. Introduction. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) 
     are important for systematically assessing a person's perspectives 
     and experiences with disease to inform clinical decision-making. 
     However, PROMs can occasionally fail to capture subtle differences 
     amongst subgroups. In response to this problem, the aim of the 
     current study was to examine the convergent validity of four 
     patient-reported voice activity and participation scales to better 
     reflect and describe the impact of a voice problem in a patient's 
     work, home, social and overall life. It was hypothesized that 
     augmenting the validated PROM with a directed situational short 
     instrument may enhance patient and clinician communication. This 
     would allow for further description of individual areas of activity 
     limitations or participation restrictions that are relevant to the 
     patient, potentially informing therapeutic goals. Methods. The Voice 
     Problem Impact Scales (VPIS) were developed following the criteria 
     outlined by Francis et al (2016). A retrospective chart review was 
     completed for voice therapy treatment seeking patients at the USC 
     Voice Center. Results from the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) and 
     VPIS scores were recorded at the time of the evaluation. Consensus 
     Auditory Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) assessment was 
     performed by an SLP with fellowship training in voice. Results. Three 
     hundred four charts were reviewed, and 198 met inclusion criteria. 
     When considering all patients, VHI-10 scores were significantly 
     correlated with each domain of the VPIS, including overall (R = 
     0.635, P < 0.001), work (R = 0.436, P < 0.001), social (R = 0.714, P 
     < 0.001), and home (R = 0.637, P < 0.001). For females aged 18-39 and 
     aged ≥60, the VHI-10 was correlated with all domains except work. 
     CAPE-V score was significantly correlated with the social domain (R = 
     0.236, P = 0.001). Using the corrected significance level, it was not 
     correlated with the overall (R = 0.165, P = 0.022), home (R = 0.197, 
     P = 0.006), or work domains (R = 0.042, P = 0.567). The VHI-10 was 
     not correlated with any of the VPIS domains for males aged 18-39, was 
     correlated with all domains for males aged 40-59, and was correlated 
     with all domains except work for males aged ≥60. Age was the only 
     significant predictor of the work domain (β = -4.631 P < 0.001), 
     with a model fit of R2 = 0.101. Conclusions. Scores from each domain 
     of the VPIS are significantly correlated with VHI-10 scores thus 
     confirming the instrument's convergent validity. There are certain 
     groups for which currently used questionnaires may underrepresent the 
     impact of dysphonia on the patient's life. The VPIS represents a 
     broad tool that might allow the patient to interpret each scale 
     within their individual context and cultural background. The VPIS 
     emphasizes the significance of the dysphonia on quality of life in 
     four common environments. Using this instrument can augment 
     questionnaires and initiate conversations between the provider and 
     patient to determine the area(s) where voice impairment is most 
     important enhancing shared decision-making on therapeutic goals for 
     plan of care.]

     AB: Summary. Objectives. To analyze the efficacy of speech-language 
     pathology therapy in the self-assessment, in the cough frequency, and 
     the vocal quality of adults with chronic cough. Methods. This is a 
     systematic review with meta-analysis that answered the clinical 
     question: "In adults with chronic cough, what is the effect of the 
     speech-language pathology therapy in the self-assessment, in the 
     cough frequency, and the vocal quality, compared to another 
     intervention?" (PROSPERO 2021/CRD42021226729). An electronic search 
     (MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library, and 
     Lilacs), and a manual search (Journal of Voice, Brazilian Library of 
     Theses and Dissertations, Open Grey and Clinical Trials) with 
     specific search strategies was performed. The risk of bias was 
     assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the 
     risk of bias in randomized trials. Meta-analysis (standardized 
     difference of means, Inverse Variance, and random effects model) and 
     heterogeneity analysis (Chi², Tau², and I²) were performed. 
     Results. We found 610 studies and selected three. There was an 
     uncertain risk of detection bias. The data were heterogeneous, and 
     there was no difference between interventions in self-perception of 
     cough severity (z = 0.09, P = 0.930; tau² = 0.65, I² = 90%) and in 
     the self-perception of the effects of chronic cough on health status 
     (z = 0.30, P = 0.77; tau² = 0.99, I² = 97%). The estimated mean 
     difference was 0.97 to cough frequency, and it was differ 
     significantly from zero (z = 4.47, P < 0.001) but the results are 
     heterogeneous (Chi² (1) = 22.22, P < 0.001, I² = 95%). Conclusion. 
     The speech-language pathology therapy had a greater effect size than 
     the control interventions on cough frequency. However, in the 
     subjects' perception, there were no differences between the 
     interventions.]

     AB: Summary. Background. Vocal fold nodules are the most common 
     etiology of chronic dysphonia in the pediatric population. Voice 
     therapy is an effective first line of treatment, with increasing 
     evidence supporting the use of telepractice in speech pathology. 
     Despite this, there is limited data on its effectiveness in the 
     pediatric population. The aim of this retrospective study was to 
     investigate the feasibility and efficacy of telepractice in 
     delivering voice therapy to children diagnosed with vocal fold 
     nodules. Methods. A retrospective review was conducted of patients 
     treated with virtual voice therapy from April 2020 to June 2021. 
     Patients were included if diagnosed with vocal fold nodules, 2-18 
     years of age, and completed therapy in a virtual format. Data 
     includes demographics, Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of 
     Voice (CAPE-V) scores and pediatric Voice Handicap Index (pVHI) 
     scores. Results. Twenty-three children were included, 17 (74%) male 
     and six (26%) female (with an age range of 2.4-9.9 years at the start 
     of therapy). Prior to treatment, the average CAPE-V Overall Severity 
     score was 37.9 (SD 13.8); the average posttreatment score was 22.4 
     (SD 10.2). The average pVHI total score prior to treatment was 26.3 
     (SD 12.1), with an average posttreatment score of 20.2 (SD 11.7). 
     Patients who underwent virtual voice therapy had improved 
     posttreatment CAPE-V severity scores than those prior to treatment 
     (average difference = -15.5 points; 95% CI: -8.3 to -22.7; P < 
     0.001). An increased number of therapy sessions was associated with 
     both higher initial CAPE-V severity scores (r = 0.72; P < 0.01) and a 
     greater decrease in posttreatment CAPE-V scores (r = -0.55; P < 
     0.01). Conclusion. Virtual voice therapy may be feasible and 
     efficacious in treating dysphonic children diagnosed with vocal fold 
     nodules. Significant improvements were found in perceptual CAPE-V 
     scores in overall severity; positive changes were also seen in 
     parental measures of quality of life. Delivery of voice therapy in a 
     telehealth format may increase access of care and should be 
     considered as a treatment option.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. to map the clinical parameters used in the 
     speech-language pathology assessment of the chronic cough. Methods. a 
     scoping review was performed to answer the clinical question: "What 
     are the clinical parameters included in the speech-language pathology 
     assessment of patients with chronic cough?" Evidence was searched by 
     electronic and manual search. The electronic search included: 
     MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and 
     LILACS. Each database had a specific search strategy. The manual 
     search included Journal of Voice, Chest, and Thorax, Brazilian 
     Library of Theses and Dissertations, Open Grey, and Clinical Trials, 
     in addition to scanning the references of the included studies. The 
     extracted data considered information regarding the publication, 
     sample, assessment, and measures used when assessing chronic cough. 
     Results. the electronic search found 289 studies; the manual search 
     found 1036 studies; 12 were selected for the present study. The most 
     used assessments were: self-assessment (75%), aerodynamic analysis 
     (66.67%), the perceptual auditory judgment of the voice quality 
     (58.33%), acoustic analysis of the voice (41.67%), cough frequency, 
     and cough threshold (41.67%) and electroglottography (25%). 
     Conclusions. the subjective instruments were used more frequently, 
     while specific objective instruments, which are recent, were used 
     less frequently. Complementary assessments such as vocal assessment, 
     have been frequently used, also, with no other parameter. A lack of 
     homogeneity was identified in the speech-language pathology 
     assessment and measures of patients with chronic cough, thus, the 
     comparison among studies and clinical analysis is difficult.]

     professional voice users (PVUs) for vocal ailments and to examine the 
     PVU's health care utilization. Methods: A Canadian national 
     cross-sectional survey was conducted. Surveys were distributed 
     electronically to members of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, 
     Television, and Radio Artists; the National Association of Teachers 
     of Singing; the Canadian Actors Equity Association; and the 
     Department of Vocal Performance at Western University. Participants 
     were asked about the products/therapies they use to improve vocal 
     health. Frequency of use, health care utilization, and general 
     influencers in treatment choice were also collected. Results: Two 
     hundred eighty-eight participants completed the survey. 86% of 
     participants claimed to have taken at least one form of CAM when 
     experiencing voice loss or a negative voice change. Of the 
     respondents, 18% claimed to use products/therapies for vocal health 
     routinely in the absence of vocal ailments. The most common CAMs used 
     were hot drinks with honey and/or lemon, lozenges, and inhaling 
     steam. When vocally ill, PVUs were significantly more likely to use 
     CAMs than any other treatment method. Voice teachers and medical 
     doctors most commonly influenced the choice of the treatment. 
     Conclusion: This study illustrated the substantial prevalence of CAMs 
     in the PVU community. Understanding the utilization of CAMs can help 
     clinicians navigate treatment strategies for this patient 
     population.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. Decision-making regarding behavioral versus 
     procedural intervention in the treatment of presbyphonia has not been 
     well defined. The study objective was to survey laryngologists' 
     reported practice patterns and decision-making in presbyphonia. 
     Methods. All laryngology faculty in U.S. academic medical centers 
     with residency programs were recruited to complete an anonymous 
     29-item survey regarding decision-making in presbyphonia treatment. 
     The survey included 5 sections: demographics, first-line treatment 
     distribution, factors that drive decision-making toward procedural 
     intervention, treatment progression if first-line treatment is 
     insufficient, durable treatment. Results. Of 153 laryngologists 
     surveyed, 89 responded (58%). Voice therapy (VT) was the most often 
     reported first-line treatment, with 57% of respondents indicating the 
     majority of their patients receive VT initially. Most respondents 
     (83%) indicated they occasionally use procedural intervention as 
     first-line treatment. Factors driving first-line procedural 
     intervention were severe glottal insufficiency (87%), high 
     occupational/social voice demands (76%), voice not stimulable for 
     change (73%), difficulty attending VT (70%), severe dysphonia (65%), 
     and dysphagia (61%). The majority of respondents indicated the 
     following do not affect their decision to pursue procedural 
     intervention: patient age (88%); medical comorbidities (63%); 
     patient's desire for a "quick fix" (55%); patient-reported outcome 
     measures (51%). Most respondents (81%) use trial injection 
     augmentation before durable treatment. Of durable treatments, 
     bilateral thyroplasty was preferred (71%), followed by CaHA (15%) and 
     lipoinjection (11%). Conclusions. This study is the first to our 
     knowledge to examine factors that influence decision-making in 
     presbyphonia treatment. While VT remains the most frequent first-line 
     treatment, study results better inform decision-making regarding 
     first-line procedural intervention.]

     This is a retrospective study that included 304 patients who visited 
     the senior author's Otolaryngology practice between the years 2018 
     and 2020. Patients were divided into two groups, those presenting for 
     dysphonia and those presenting for other otolaryngologic complaints 
     (Controls). Patients were also stratified as Normal weight (BMI < 25 
     kg/m2) vs. Overweight (BMI between 25-30 kg/m2), vs. Obese (BMI ≥ 
     25 kg/m2). The VHI-10 was used as a subjective outcome measure 
     reported by patients with dysphonia. Results. A total of 304 patients 
     included in this study, 203 presenting with dysphonia and 101 with 
     other otolaryngologic complaint. Within the dysphonia group, a 
     significantly higher percentage of patients had a BMI ≥ 25 (70.4%) 
     as compared to the control group (57.4%). The odds ratio were 1.76, 
     meaning that obese patients were 1.76 times more likely to present 
     with dysphonia. There was a weak negative correlation between 
     overweight, obesity, and VHI-10 scores (r=-0.007 and r=-0.039, 
     respectively). Conclusion. There was a significantly higher 
     prevalence of overweight and obesity in patients with dysphonia vs. 
     patients with no dysphonia. Although there was a weak correlation 
     between BMI and VHI, our results demonstrate that overweight and 
     obese patients are more likely to have dysphonia.]

     AB: Summary. Research Question. Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) may 
     cause inflammation of the laryngeal and pharyngeal mucosa. 
     Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) involves retrograde flow of 
     gastric content into the esophagus below the upper esophageal 
     sphincter (UES). The goal of this study was to investigate the 
     esophageal anatomical and manometric variations of the esophagus in 
     patients with LPR and/or GERD. Methods. Adult voice center patients 
     who underwent diagnostic workup for reflux complaints with 24-hour 
     multichannel intraluminal pH-impedance testing and esophageal 
     manometry were included in this retrospective study. Subjects were 
     classified as having LPR (>10 proximal reflux events), LPR + GERD 
     (>10 proximal reflux events plus >73 distal reflux events) or were 
     assigned to a control group (≤10 proximal events and ≤73 distal 
     reflux events) based on pH study results. Anatomic and manometric 
     parameters were evaluated between groups. Results. There were 169 
     cases (65 male, 104 female) included in this study. The average age 
     was 50.50 ± 17.29. Subjects in the LPR group had significantly 
     higher UES relaxation pressures and greater UES length compared with 
     the control group. Lower esophageal sphincter relaxation pressure was 
     significantly higher in the control group compared with the LPR group 
     or the GERD + LPR group. Subjects in the GERD + LPR group had a 
     significantly shorter intra-abdominal portion of the lower esophageal 
     sphincter compared with the LPR only group and the control group. 
     Intrabolus pressure was significantly lower in both the LPR group and 
     the LPR + GERD group compared with the control group. Distal wave 
     amplitude was significantly lower in the LPR + GERD group compared to 
     both the LPR group and the control group. The percentage of swallows 
     with incomplete clearance was significantly greater in the LPR + GERD 
     group than both the control group and the LPR group. The LPR group 
     had significantly fewer swallows with incomplete clearance than the 
     control group. Conclusions. Anatomic and manometric abnormalities are 
     present in subjects with LPR with or without GERD and may contribute 
     to the pathogenesis of reflux disease. Further research is needed to 
     confirm or refute these findings.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. To describe the prevalence of 
     laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)-related symptoms in allergy patient 
     using the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) by Belafsky et al and the Reflux 
     Symptom Score (RSS) by Lechien et al. Subjects and Methods. A total 
     of 84 patients were enrolled in this study. Fifty-two consecutive 
     patients were asked to fill RSI. Similarly, 32 patients were asked to 
     fill RSS. Demographic data included age, gender, history of smoking, 
     family history for eczema, atopy, asthma, food and drug allergy. 
     Results. Fifty-seven of the 84 patients were positive for at least 
     one allergen and hence were diagnosed with allergy. Of the 52 
     patients who received the RSI, 36 patients were allergic to at least 
     one allergen (36/52). Of the 32 patients who filled the RSS, 21 
     tested positive for at least one allergen (21/32). There was no 
     significant difference in the number of positive RSI scores (>13) 
     between patients with allergy to at least one allergen in comparison 
     to patients with no allergy (P = 0.329). There was a significant 
     difference in the number of positive RSS scores (>13) between 
     patients with allergy to at least one allergen in comparison to 
     patients with no allergy (P-value 0.0345). The odds of having RSS >13 
     in an allergic patient was significant (OR = 5.6, CI 95% = 
     1.15-27.37). Conclusion. The results of this study provide evidence 
     that patients with allergy have increased incidence of LPR related 
     symptoms using the RSS. The cross-cutting in the clinical picture of 
     patients with allergy and LPR stresses the need for objective testing 
     such as double probe Ph-metry and impedance to diagnose this latter. 
     Future studies are needed to explore further the cause-effect 
     relationship between allergy and LPR.]

     AB: Summary. Objectives. Early identification of vocal fold 
     leukoplakia (VFL), which has a risk of progressing to malignant 
     transformation, remains a controversial topic. The identification of 
     biological markers for diagnosing these lesions would lead to a more 
     effective treatment. We aimed to analyze the immunoexpression of 
     cathepsin B and E-cadherin in VFL and correlate it with clinical and 
     epidemiological data and disease prognosis. Methods. Thirty-two 
     patients with VFL treated with microsurgery were retrospectively 
     evaluated. The patients were distributed according to the 
     histological results into Group A (low grade) and Group B (high 
     grade). The expression of markers was quantitatively determined as 
     per their staining intensity and tissue distribution using ImageLab. 
     The index of expression (IE) of each marker was correlated with 
     tobacco and alcohol consumption, signs of laryngopharyngeal reflux, 
     and local recurrence of the lesion. Results. The correlation between 
     the IE of markers and variables within the two groups (A and B) 
     demonstrated that patients in Group B with local recurrence had a 
     higher IE of cathepsin B. When all patients (A + B) were included, 
     the same analysis demonstrated that the IE of cathepsin B was higher 
     among smokers and patients who did not show signs of reflux and that 
     the IE of E-cadherin was higher only in patients with recurrence. 
     Conclusion. Patients with moderate to severe dysplasia and carcinoma 
     in situ who smoked as well as had a high IE of cathepsin B were more 
     prone to local recurrence. Regardless of the type of histological 
     lesion, patients with signs of laryngopharyngeal reflux had a lower 
     IE of cathepsin B. The IE of E-cadherin was higher among patients 
     with VFL who relapsed after initial treatment.]

     AB: Summary. In a musical wind instrument, sound is produced by 
     vibration of air, typically created by the player blowing into the 
     instrument. Many researchers believe that wind instrumentalists have 
     vocal and laryngeal problems related to playing their instruments. In 
     this study, wind instrumentalists were defined as those who had a 
     history (1 year or more) of studying a wind instrument (flute, 
     clarinet, saxophone, oboe, bassoon, trumpet, trombone, tuba, or 
     French horn) at any time in their lives. Laryngeal electromyography 
     (L EMG) had been obtained because vocal fold paresis was suspected 
     clinically. Data analysis indicated that wind instrument players 
     appear to experience greater levels of decreased nerve recruitment 
     than non-instrumentalist singers do who present with paresis. 
     Methodology. Voice patients who underwent laryngeal EMG for 
     clinically suspected vocal fold paresis between 2019 and 2021 were 
     included in the study. Subjects were divided into two groups 
     depending on history of playing wind instruments. Only patients with 
     insufficient information in their medical records were excluded. All 
     data were reviewed retrospectively. Percentage of nerve recruitment, 
     the recruitment rating scale used in previous studies, wind 
     instrument played, gender, age, and laryngeal Myasthenia Gravis 
     diagnosis were variables included in the descriptive statistics, 
     correlational, and regression analyses used for statistical analysis. 
     Results. Data analysis indicated that in the 103 subjects included 
     (47 wind instrumentalists and 56 non-wind instrumentalists) that wind 
     instrument players, past and present, experience levels of greater 
     decreased nerve recruitment that non-instrumentalist singers do when 
     presenting with paresis. Kind of wind instrument played was 
     statistically significant but moderately correlated to the RRS 
     (Recruitment Rating Scale) of the left PCA. Sex was correlated 
     moderately and statistically significantly with right CT recruitment. 
     Conclusion. Playing wind instruments in voice patients diagnosed with 
     paresis might be associated with increased severity of laryngeal 
     nerve damage. Further research is needed to confirm or refute these 
     findings.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. To evaluate the anatomical and voice results 
     of conservative management of patients diagnosed with contralateral 
     reactive lesions (CRL) in our voice unit. Methods. A retrospective 
     chart review was conducted of all new adult patients with benign 
     vocal fold lesions with or without CRL, treated in the voice unit at 
     Universidad Católica Clinical Hospital between 2015 and 2019. 
     Patients were divided into two groups, without CRL (group A) and with 
     CRL (group B). Analysis of preoperative and 1 month after surgery 
     videostroboscopy, GRBASI, Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), Voice 
     Related Quality of Life (VRQOL) surveys and management of CRL was 
     conducted. Results. A total of 62 patients were included, 45 (72.6%) 
     had CRL. When compared, bivariate and multivariate analysis revealed 
     that age was significantly associated as a mild protective factor of 
     presenting a CRL (P < 0.05). No significative differences were found 
     between preoperative group A and B perceptual voice analysis or voice 
     surveys. In terms of CRL management, 30 (66.6%) were injected, 
     conservative management with observation was performed in 12 patients 
     (26.7%) and, three (6.7%) were surgically resected. After 1 month 
     follow-up, 32 (71.1%) had complete CRL resolution, eight (17.8%) had 
     CRL persistence and, five (11.1%) had CRL recurrence. Postoperative 
     vocal outcomes, GRBASI, VHI-10 and VRQOL showed significative 
     improvement as compared with preoperative data for each group. No 
     differences were seen between group A and B in terms of postoperative 
     vocal outcomes. Conclusion. CRL are prevalent, and their management 
     is controversial. On our study 72.6% of BFVL presented with CRL and 
     93.3% of them were conservatively managed. Improvement in perceptual 
     voice analysis and quality of life surveys were similar in both 
     groups.]

     AB: Summary. Purpose. Voice change is one of the major symptoms in 
     patients with vocal fold polyp. As a result, phonomicrosurgery is 
     commonly required in these patients. Since voice outcomes after polyp 
     treatment can be variable according to polyp characteristics, we 
     aimed to investigate the predicting factors of postoperative voice 
     improvements in terms of polyp characteristics in patients with vocal 
     fold polyp who underwent cold knife surgery. Materials and Methods. A 
     total of 77 patients who were diagnosed with vocal fold polyp and 
     underwent phonomicrosurgery with cold knife instruments. The polyp 
     characteristics of color, size, shape, and location were evaluated at 
     baseline. Acoustic and aerodynamic analyses, voice handicap index 
     questionnaire and grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain 
     scale were evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks after surgery. Results. 
     All values of postoperative voice parameters improved after cold 
     knife surgery. (P < 0.05) In patient with an organized vocal fold 
     polyp, less improvement in postoperative values of maximum phonation 
     time were observed. (P < 0.05) Likewise, less improvement of voice 
     handicap index questionnaire score and grade, roughness, breathiness, 
     asthenia, strain scale after surgery was shown in organized vocal 
     fold polyp. (P < 0.05) Conclusions. Among the various polyp 
     characteristics, the organized polyp was significantly related to 
     relatively less improvement of objective and subjective voice 
     parameters after surgery. These polyp characteristics would help to 
     predict postoperative voice improvement and plan for personalized 
     treatment in patients with vocal fold polyp.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. A prospective single blinded randomized 
     control trial was conducted to study if early initiation of voice 
     therapy after microlaryngeal produces a better voice outcome in 
     patients with benign vocal fold lesions. Methods. In this Patients 
     undergoing microlaryngeal surgery for benign vocal fold lesions were 
     recruited for the study and underwent voice evaluation and 
     videostroboscopy preoperatively. Participants were randomised into 
     two groups depending on the duration of voice rest-A (2 days voice 
     rest) and B (5 days voice rest). Following the period of voice rest, 
     voice therapy (tube phonation) was carried out for a month. 
     Postoperative evaluation was done at 6 weeks (over telephone) and 3 
     months (in person visit) follow up. Outcome measures included the 
     VHI-10, auditory-perceptual voice ratings, acoustic analysis and 
     videostroboscopic vibratory ratings. Results. Of the 50 subjects, 35 
     completed the follow up evaluation. The overall compliance to 
     absolute voice rest was 43%. Among the various parameters used for 
     voice evaluation, there was no statistically significant difference 
     between the two groups except for jitter, where the improvement in 5 
     day voice rest group compared to the 2 day voice rest group was 
     statistically significant. Conclusion. Prolonged voice rest after 
     microlaryngeal surgery is difficult to comply with. As there was no 
     significant difference between the two study groups, clinicians may 
     prescribe a shorter duration of voice rest followed by early 
     initiation of voice therapy after microlaryngeal surgery.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. In standardized connected speech samples, 
     cepstral peak prominence (CPP) and smoothed CPP (CPPS) have been 
     described as accurate parameters to evaluate voice quality. Lack of 
     normal auditory feedback in post-lingually deaf CI users might 
     influence tuning the acoustic parameters in speech production. Based 
     on shreds of evidence, normal hearing results in suitable vocal 
     control through the sensory-motor linkage. The main aim of the 
     present study was to compare the cepstral values between the Iranian 
     cochlear implant group and normal peers. Method. Persian CAPE-V 
     sentences were recorded from 30 CI users and 30 healthy speakers 
     (mean age=36.7 years, SD=13.5, range=18-60 years). Thirteen /a/vowels 
     were extracted manually from syllables. Each subject phonated 
     sustained /a/vowel for 5 seconds. PRAAT was used to calculate CPP and 
     CPPS. To compare two age- and gender-matched groups, the independent 
     sample t-test was applied. Then, ANCOVA was used to assess the impact 
     of demographic factors on cepstral scores in CI participants. 
     Results. Significant differences between the CI group and normal 
     peers were discovered based on CPP and CPPS in both tasks (reading 
     sentences and sustained vowel) (P < 0.05). Overall, CI users showed 
     higher cepstral values. The implanted ear and prosthesis model had no 
     significant impact on both CPP and CPPS (P ≥ 0.8). Conclusion. 
     Higher CPP and CPPS values in the CI users might be due to increased 
     phonatory instability and spectral noise, with the possibility of 
     decreased vocal control and its quality. The outcome suggests that CI 
     group uses a different voice control strategy. These findings should 
     be kept in mind for intervention methods, especially by assessing 
     vocal characteristics and considering the voice quality in adult CI 
     users.]

     AB: Summary. Many virological tests have been implemented during the 
     Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for diagnostic purposes, 
     but they appear unsuitable for screening purposes. Furthermore, 
     current screening strategies are not accurate enough to effectively 
     curb the spread of the disease. Therefore, the present study was 
     conducted within a controlled clinical environment to determine 
     eventual detectable variations in the voice of COVID-19 patients, 
     recovered and healthy subjects, and also to determine whether machine 
     learning-based voice assessment (MLVA) can accurately discriminate 
     between them, thus potentially serving as a more effective 
     mass-screening tool. Three different subpopulations were 
     consecutively recruited: positive COVID-19 patients, recovered 
     COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals as controls. Positive 
     patients were recruited within 10 days from nasal swab positivity. 
     Recovery from COVID-19 was established clinically, virologically and 
     radiologically. Healthy individuals reported no COVID-19 symptoms and 
     yielded negative results at serological testing. All study 
     participants provided three trials for multiple vocal tasks 
     (sustained vowel phonation, speech, cough). All recordings were 
     initially divided into three different binary classifications with a 
     feature selection, ranking and cross-validated RBF-SVM pipeline. This 
     brough a mean accuracy of 90.24%, a mean sensitivity of 91.15%, a 
     mean specificity of 89.13% and a mean AUC of 0.94 across all tasks 
     and all comparisons, and outlined the sustained vowel as the most 
     effective vocal task for COVID discrimination. Moreover, a three-way 
     classification was carried out on an external test set comprised of 
     30 subjects, 10 per class, with a mean accuracy of 80% and an 
     accuracy of 100% for the detection of positive subjects. Within this 
     assessment, recovered individuals proved to be the most difficult 
     class to identify, and all the misclassified subjects were declared 
     positive; this might be related to mid and short-term vocal traces of 
     COVID-19, even after the clinical resolution of the infection. In 
     conclusion, MLVA may accurately discriminate between positive 
     COVID-19 patients, recovered COVID-19 patients and healthy 
     individuals. Further studies should test MLVA among larger 
     populations and asymptomatic positive COVID-19 patients to validate 
     this novel screening technology and test its potential application as 
     a potentially more effective surveillance strategy for COVID-19.]

     association between various possible risk factors and healthcare 
     disparities specifically related to the access, use and/or quality of 
     speech language pathology services for individuals with voice and 
     upper airway disorders. Method. A systematic review was conducted 
     using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
     Meta-Analysis. Full text journal articles were identified through 
     PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science. The reference sections of 
     included articles were also manually screened and identified four 
     additional studies for consideration of inclusion. Included articles 
     specifically addressed healthcare disparities in voice and upper 
     airway disorders related to speech pathology care. International 
     literature was excluded. Eligible studies were reviewed and data 
     extracted. Risk of bias of each eligible study was performed using 
     the quality assessment tool from National Institute of Health for 
     observational cohort and cross-sectional studies. Data from eligible 
     studies were synthesized thematically. Results. A total of 1,101 
     resources were retrieved from the search; of these, 133 were 
     duplicates. Titles and abstracts of 968 articles were screened, with 
     14 selected for full-text review. Eleven articles were considered 
     eligible for inclusion. Voice disorders were the condition most 
     frequently examined followed by only one article addressing upper 
     airways disorders. There was considerable heterogeneity in the 
     methodology and statistical analyses among the eligible papers. There 
     was a lack of standard methodology for collecting and accurately 
     determining patient characteristics as well as variability in 
     measuring confounding variables and providing statistical analyses 
     for such adjustments that may have impacted the findings. The 
     information extracted from these articles revealed healthcare 
     disparities related to sex/gender, age, insurance status/coverage, 
     race/ethnicity, among others including etiology and preferred 
     language. Conclusions. This systematic review highlights the limited 
     research on speech language pathology-specific healthcare disparities 
     for individuals with voice and upper airway disorders. There was 
     significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies 
     which may have contributed to varied results between studies. There 
     is a need for greater methodological rigor and prospectively designed 
     studies to better characterize the impact of disparities in the 
     access to, use of, and quality of speech pathology care for this 
     patient population.]

     AB: Summary. Objectives. World Health Organization declared the 
     coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a global pandemic on March 11, 
     2020. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness and 
     reliability of voice analysis performed with surgical masks and 
     respirators during the pandemic and to discuss its routine 
     applicability. Methods. This prospective study included 204 patients 
     who applied to our clinic between the ages of 18 and 55, whose 
     preoperative SARS-Cov-2 PCR tests were negative. Voice analyses were 
     performed on each patient without a mask, with a surgical mask and 
     with a valved face-filtering piece-3 (FFP3) respirator respectively. 
     The F0, shimmer, jitter, s/z ratio, maximum phonation time and 
     harmonic/noise ratio (HNR) values obtained from the voice analyses 
     were compared with each other. Results. No significant difference was 
     found in terms of F0, Jitter, Shimmer, HNR, s/z and maximum phonation 
     time values in the voice analyses performed without a mask and with a 
     surgical mask. With an FFP3, a significant difference was found in

     of female and male patients, when the data of voice analysis obtained 
     in three situations were compared, different results were obtained 
     from the female and male group. Conclusion. In conclusion, it should 
     be decided by the physician to perform the voice analysis with a 
     surgical mask or with an FFP3, considering the clinically desired 
     parameters.]

     AB: Summary. Objectives. The aim of this research study is to 
     determine the risk factors for voice disorders in SLP students in 
     order to help us develop specific goals for a vocal hygiene education 
     program specifically for SLP students. Methods. An online 
     questionnaire was completed by 121 undergraduate SLP students. 
     Participants were divided into two groups, students with no 
     self-perceived voice disorders (NVD group) and students with 
     self-perceived voice disorders (VD group). The Fisher Exact test 
     (FET) was used to explore the differences in responses for each voice 
     risk factor and the academic and occupational consequences between 
     students with and without self-perceived voice disorders. Results. 
     Students in the VD group were more likely to experience vocal fold 
     problems, hearing problems and throat clearing than in the NVD group. 
     More students in the VD group reported to "sometimes' and "often" 
     take medications that impact their voice, hear a "moderate" amount of 
     noise generated from the passage of planes and the road and hear a 
     "moderate" and "large" amount of noise generated within and outside 
     the building than in the NVD group. Moreover, students in the VD 
     group were more likely to limit their ability to perform certain 
     tasks at school (eg, participating in lectures) and clinical 
     practicum (eg, administering therapy sessions) and reduce their 
     interactions annually due to voice problems. Conclusions. Health, 
     voice use, lifestyle, and environmental factors are risk factors for 
     voice disorders that were presented more frequently in SLP students 
     with self-perceived voice disorders.]

     AB: Summary. Objective. This integrative review aims to determine the 
     quality level of evidence on using surface electromyography (sEMG) as 
     a diagnostic tool in identifying muscle tension dysphonia. Method. 
     Two independent reviewers used one search engine and five databases 
     to identify sEMG studies published between January 1980 and December 
     2020, using a set of specified search terms related to muscle tension 
     dysphonia. The selected articles were systematically evaluated by two 
     independent raters using a modified critical appraisal of diagnostic 
     evidence (m-CADE) form. Results. Nine articles that satisfied the 
     inclusion criteria were selected from among 576 studies for 
     evaluation. These nine studies showed varied methodological 
     approaches in sEMG measurements, including electrode configuration 
     and position, tasks used in sEMG data collection, outcome measure, 
     and normalization procedures. Five studies showed relatively high 
     m-CADE scores, which were indicative of "suggestive validity and 
     compelling importance". Two studies were rated as "suggestive 
     validity and importance", while two remaining studies were rated as 
     "less suggestive or equivocal validity and importance". Conclusions. 
     The review found a moderate level of evidence that sEMG can be a 
     potentially useful tool with diagnostic value in identifying muscle 
     tension dysphonia. However, evidence is not yet available to 
     determine the diagnostic accuracy of sEMG for muscle tension 
     dysphonia. More studies are needed, and it is recommended that future 
     studies involving sEMG and reference measurements should be 
     undertaken using a blinding procedure in order to control any 
     subjective biases. Details of the population that the sEMG has been 
     tested on should be outlined clearly so that spectrum bias could be 
     eliminated or minimized in the application process. Furthermore, it 
     is suggested that a reliable and valid protocol in collecting sEMG 
     data during speech should be developed to minimize the variability of 
     sEMG measures in assessing muscle activities during speech.]

     AB: Summary. Purpose. This study evaluated the amount of phonatory 
     activity of Persons with Parkinson disease (PwPD) compared to adults 
     without Parkinson's disease measured over 3 days. The relationship 
     between the amount of phonatory activity and Voice Handicap Index 
     (VHI) total score was assessed as were differences in voicing 
     activity across 3 days of data collection. Methods. Fifteen PwPD 
     receiving dopaminergic medication and fifteen age and sex matched 
     adults without Parkinson's disease completed the VHI and then wore a 
     VocaLog vocal monitor (VM) for 3 consecutive days. From the VM data, 
     the number of 1-second windows with dB sound pressure level > 0 were 
     summed as a measure of phonatory activity (PA) and reported relative 
     to the time the VM was worn (%PA). Results. The percentage of time 
     the VM was worn did not differ between groups or across days. The 
     PwPD had statistically significantly fewer minutes of PA per day than 
     controls (F = 21.782, P < 0.001) by 54 minutes on average. The %PA 
     also differed significantly (F = 31.825, P < 0.001) with a mean of 
     11.1% for PwPD and 18.6% for controls. Neither PA nor %PA differed 
     across the 3 days of vocal monitoring. VHI total score was 
     significantly correlated with PA (r = -0.436, P = 0.016) and %PA (r = 
     -0.534, P = 0.002) for all participants. Conclusions. The results 
     indicate that PwPD engaged in less verbal communication in their 
     daily environment compared to adults without Parkinson's disease. The 
     findings support reports in the literature indicating that PwPD often 
     have reduced communication participation. Measures such as %PA could 
     serve as a quantifiable metric in future studies assessing 
     communication changes in PwPD as a function of disease progression or 
     therapeutic interventions.]

     AB: Summary. Objectives. The purpose of this study was to assess the 
     outcome following continuous tactile biofeedback of voice sound level 
     administered, with a portable voice accumulator to individuals with 
     Parkinson's disease (PD). Method. Nine out of 16 participants with PD 
     completed a 4-week intervention program where biofeedback of voice 
     sound level was administered with the portable voice accumulator 
     VoxLog during speech in daily life. The feedback, a tactile vibration 
     signal from the device, was activated when the wearer used a voice 
     sound level below an individually predetermined threshold level, 
     reminding the wearer to increase voice sound level during speech. 
     Voice use was registered in daily life with the VoxLog during the 
     intervention period as well as during one baseline week, one 
     follow-up week post intervention and 1 week 3 months post 
     intervention. Self-to-other ratio (SOR), which is the difference 
     between voice sound level and environmental noise, was studied in 
     multiple noise ranges. Results. A significant increase in SOR across 
     all noise ranges of 2.28 dB (SD: 0.55) was seen for participants with 
     scores above the cut-off for normal function (>26 points) on the 
     cognitive screening test Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (n = 
     5). No significant increase was seen for the group of participants 
     with MoCA scores below 26 (n = 4). Forty-four percent ended their 
     participation early, all which scored below 26 on MoCA (n = 7). 
     Conclusions. Biofeedback administered in daily life regarding voice 
     level may help individuals with PD to increase their voice sound 
     level in relation to environmental noise in daily life, but only for 
     a limited subset. Only participants with normal cognitive function as 
     screened by MoCA improved their voice sound level in relation to 
     environmental noise.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Physical activity (PA) has multiple 
     benefits for older adults (≥70 years old). Despite this many older 
     adults do not undertake the World Health Organisation guideline 
     recommended amount of PA. This systematic review examines barriers 
     and motivators to PA in adults aged ≥70 years. Methods. We analysed 
     the quantitative literature, including observational studies and 
     baseline data from randomised controlled trials. Studies examining 
     specific diseases (e.g. cognitive impairment), or care home residents 
     were excluded. Database searches of ASSIA, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, 
     PsycINFO and Web of Science were undertaken on 7 March 2023. Quality 
     assessment was performed using the ROBANS tool. We synthesised the 
     results using the socioecological model. The protocol was registered 
     on PROSPERO (CRD42021160503). Results. We identified 37 papers, n = 
     26,961, age 70-101 years (median 78), 62% female. We undertook a 
     narrative review; meta-analysis was not possible. Overall risk of 
     bias was low. A total of 23 studies addressed barriers, seven 
     motivators, seven both. The most cited barriers were: concern about 
     physical health/fitness (14 studies), lack of motivation/interest (13 
     studies), fear of falls/history of falling (11 studies) and 
     environmental barriers (10 studies). Key motivators were: support 
     from family/friends (five studies), social interaction (five 
     studies), personal benefits (five studies) and outside facilities 
     (five studies). Results varied across gender, age, functional ability 
     and geographical location. Discussion. To maximise PA in older 
     adults, important modifiable factors identified in this review should 
     be targeted: support from healthcare professionals; reducing fear of 
     falls; and prioritising ease of access and safety of outdoor 
     facilities. When considering future policy, a person-centred, age 
     group appropriate approach will have the most impact.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. To explore the practice of prescribing and 
     implementing early mobilisation and weight-bearing as tolerated after 
     hip fracture surgery in older adults and identify barriers and 
     facilitators to their implementation. Methods. Semi-structured 
     interviews were conducted with 20 healthcare providers (10 
     orthopaedic surgeons and 10 physiotherapists) from Saudi Arabian 
     government hospitals. Data were analysed using inductive thematic 
     analysis. Results. While early mobilisation and weight-bearing as 
     tolerated were viewed as important by most participants, they 
     highlighted barriers to the implementation of these practices. Most 
     participants advocated for mobility within 48 h of surgery, aligning 
     with international guidance; however, the implementation of 
     weight-bearing as tolerated was varied. Some participants stressed 
     the type of surgery undertaken as a key factor in weight-bearing 
     prescription. For others, local protocols or clinician preference was 
     seen as most important, the latter partially influenced by where they 
     were trained. Interdisciplinary collaboration between orthopaedic 
     surgeons and physiotherapists was seen as a crucial part of 
     postoperative care and weight-bearing. Patient and family member 
     buy-in was also noted as a key factor, as fear of further injury can 
     impact a patient's adherence to weight-bearing prescriptions. 
     Participants noted a lack of standardised postoperative protocols and 
     the need for routine patient audits to better understand current 
     practices and outcomes. Conclusion. This study contributes to 
     national and global discussions on the prescription of early 
     mobilisation and weight-bearing as tolerated. It highlights the 
     necessity for a harmonised approach, incorporating standardised, 
     evidence-based protocols with patient-specific care, robust 
     healthcare governance and routine audits and monitoring for quality 
     assurance and better patient outcomes.]

     AB: Abstract. Rumination and worry are common risk factors of 
     depression and anxiety. Internet-based transdiagnostic interventions 
     targeting individuals with these specific risks may be an effective 
     way to prevent depression and anxiety. This three-arm randomized 
     controlled trial compared the efficacy of Internet-based 
     rumination-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (RFCBT), 
     mindfulness-based intervention (MBI), and psychoeducation (EDU) 
     control among 256 at-risk individuals. Participants' levels of 
     rumination, worry, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were assessed at 
     post-intervention (6 weeks), 3-month, and 9-month follow-ups. Linear 
     mixed model analysis results showed similar levels of improvement in 
     all outcomes across the three conditions. Changes in rumination 
     differed comparing RFCBT and MBI, where a significant reduction in 
     rumination was noted at a 3-month follow-up among participants in 
     RFCBT, and no significant long-term effect among participants in MBI 
     was noted at a 9-month follow-up. All three conditions showed similar 
     reductions in risks and symptoms, implying that the two active 
     interventions were not superior to EDU control. The high attrition at 
     follow-ups suggested a need to exercise caution when interpreting the 
     findings. Future studies should tease apart placebo effect and 
     identify ways to improve adherence.]

     AB: Abstract. Students in health professions often face high levels 
     of stress due to demanding academic schedules, heavy workloads, 
     disrupted work-life balance, and sleep deprivation. Addressing stress 
     during their education can prevent negative consequences for their 
     mental health and the well-being of their future patients. Previous 
     reviews on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions 
     (MBIs) focused on working health professionals or included a wide 
     range of intervention types and durations. This study aims to 
     investigate the effect of 6- to 12-week MBIs with 1- to 2-h weekly 
     sessions on stress in future health professionals. We conducted a 
     systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials 
     published in English by searching Embase, Medline, Web of Science, 
     Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO. We used 
     post-intervention stress levels and standard deviations to assess the 
     ability of MBIs to reduce stress, summarized by the standardized mean 
     difference (SMD). This review is reported according to the PRISMA 
     checklist (2020). We identified 2932 studies, of which 11 were 
     included in the systematic review and 10 had sufficient data for 
     inclusion in the meta-analysis. The overall effect of MBIs on 
     reducing stress was a SMD of 0.60 (95% CI [0.27, 0.94]). Our study 
     provides evidence that MBIs have a moderate reducing effect on stress 
     in students in health professions; however, given the high risk of 
     bias, these findings should be interpreted with caution, and further 
     high-quality studies are needed.]

     AB: Abstract. Whole-body vibration (WBV) is prevalent in 
     labour-related activities and can have adverse effects on the health 
     and performance of the individuals exposed. However, evidence 
     regarding the extent to which human functionality is affected 
     following occupational WBV exposure has not been collated. The 
     current systematic review sought to synthesize existing literature 
     and assess the strength and direction of evidence regarding the acute 
     after-effects of occupational WBV exposure on cognition, visual 
     function, postural stability, and motor control. We conducted a 
     comprehensive search of AMED, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMED, Psychology and 
     Behavioural Sciences Collection, SPORTDiscus, APA PsychInfo, Cochrane 
     Library, EMBASE, HMIC, Global Health, ProQuest Central, Scopus, Web 
     of Science, and the US National Technical Information Service on 
     April 26, 2023. Studies that quantified vibration exposure and 
     measured acute changes in cognition, visual function, postural 
     stability, and motor control from baseline to post-vibration were 
     considered without date restriction. Out of the 2663 studies 
     identified, 32 were eligible for inclusion. Based on the Risk of Bias 
     in Non-Randomized Studies of Exposure (ROBINS-E) tool, the studies 
     demonstrated low (66%), moderate (25%) and high risk of bias (9%). 
     The findings indicate that after exposure to WBV, postural stability 
     either deteriorates or remains unchanged. Inconsistent effects of WBV 
     on cognition were reported, while visual function and motor control 
     showed no pronounced changes following WBV. This might be attributed 
     to assessment limitations such as learning effects in 
     neuropsychological and motor tasks, and non-functional measures of 
     vision employed. There was a lack of consistency in the 
     characterization of vibration exposure and the assessment of 
     associated effects on functional performance. Current evidence is 
     therefore insufficient to provide definitive guidance for updating 
     occupational health and safety regulations regarding WBV. However, 
     this review highlights the potential for WBV to jeopardize 
     post-exposure human performance and, consequently, safety.]

     not statistically significant. Visual analysis indicated improved 
     Life-H accomplishment scores post-intervention, but satisfaction with 
     employment scores did not change. PREP was positively perceived, but 
     the young adults reported needing more support from their 
     participation teams. Conclusions. The PREP intervention shifts the 
     focus from a skills-based approach to a participation approach to 
     practice and empowers young adults with intellectual disabilities to 
     have greater independence over employment goals and related 
     activities. COVID-19 restrictions limited the application of the PREP 
     approach, but the experience was still valued by the participants, 
     although additional training and support for them and the PREP 
     participation team working with them may have further enhanced their 
     experience and participation outcomes.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Despite the growing diversity among 
     students in higher education, nonprogression to postsecondary 
     education persists for many students with intellectual disabilities 
     with low completion rates for those who do progress. Research 
     suggests that occupational therapy (OT) support can be extremely 
     beneficial in assisting students. Less is known however about the 
     impact of OT in higher education. This study aims to examine the use 
     of OT embedded in a postsecondary programme for students with 
     intellectual disabilities. Methods. This study uses a scoping review 
     of relevant literature and a qualitative analysis of OT working in a 
     higher education programme specifically designed for students with 
     intellectual disabilities in Ireland. Findings. This paper highlights 
     how the OT support within this programme uses a four-fold 
     collaborative approach supporting students, staff, business partners 
     and wider organisational structures in the university. Conclusion. 
     The analysis highlights the opportunities for collaboration between 
     OT and curriculum developers, teaching and ancillary staff and 
     students in higher education along with the significant OT input into 
     work placements and internships with business partner mentors. 
     Challenges in educating stakeholders to understand OT in the higher 
     education environment would suggest a substantial need for further 
     research.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. While constraint-induced movement therapy 
     is strongly recommended as an intervention for infants with 
     unilateral cerebral palsy, the optimal dosage remains undefined. This 
     systematic review aims to identify the most effective level of 
     intensity of constraint-induced movement therapy to enhance manual 
     function in infants at high risk of asymmetric brain lesions or 
     unilateral cerebral palsy diagnosis. Methods. This systematic review 
     with meta-analysis encompassed a comprehensive search across four 
     electronic databases to identify articles that met the following 
     criteria: randomised controlled trials, children aged 0-6 with at 
     high risk or with unilateral cerebral palsy, and treatment involving 
     constraint-induced movement therapy for upper limb function. Studies 
     with similar outcomes were pooled by calculating the standardised 
     mean difference score for each subgroup, and subgroups were 
     stratified every 30 h of total intervention dosage (30-60, 61-90, >90 
     h). Risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane Collaboration's tool. 
     Results. Seventeen studies were included. Meta-analyses revealed 
     significant differences among subgroups. The 30-60 h subgroup showed 
     a weak effect for spontaneous use of the affected upper limb during 
     bimanual performance, grasp function, and parents' perception of how 
     often children use their affected upper limb. Additionally, this 
     subgroup demonstrated a moderate effect for the parents' perception 
     of how effectively children use their affected upper limb. 
     Conclusions. Using a dosage ranging from 30 to 60 h when applying a 
     constraint-induced movement therapy protocol holds promise as the 
     most age-appropriate and cost-effectiveness approach for improving 
     upper limb functional outcomes and parent's perception.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. The aim of this study is to identify the 
     main processes and outcomes related to family-centred care (FCC) in 
     neuromotor and functional rehabilitation of preschool children with 
     cerebral palsy (CP). Background. FCC is considered a reference for 
     best practices in child rehabilitation. CP is the most common cause 
     of physical disability in childhood with repercussions on 
     functionality. There is a gap in knowledge of the practical 
     principles of FCC, and it is necessary to develop a reference model 
     for the practice of child rehabilitation professionals. Methods. In 
     this scoping review, the main databases selected were as follows: 
     LILACS; Pubmed; Embase; The Cochrane Library; CINAHL (EBSCO); Scopus; 
     Web of Science; PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database); Open Gray 
     and other banks of thesis. The terms combined in the search strategy 
     were as follows: 'Family-centered', 'Family-centred' and 'CP'. 
     Inclusion criteria are as follows: studies on preschool-aged children 
     with CP, undergoing family-centred functional therapeutic 
     interventions (FCFTI) with outcomes on bodily structures and 
     functions and/or activities and/or participation. Results. The main 
     participatory care methods identified were home intervention, 
     environmental enrichment, collaborative realistic goal setting, 
     planning of home-based activities and routine, child assessment 
     feedback, family education/training, family coaching, encouraging 
     discussion, observation of therapist and supervised practice. The 
     main relational care qualities identified were as follows: respect, 
     active listening, treat parents as equals, clear language, respect 
     parents' ability to collaborate, demonstrate genuine care for the 
     family, appreciate parents' knowledge and skills, demonstrate 
     competence, experience and commitment. The main outcomes identified 
     in children were improvement in motor and cognitive function and the 
     child's functional ability. The main parentaloutcomes identified were 
     empowerment, feeling of competence, self-confidence, motivation and 
     engagement. Conclusion. The main differences in FCFTI programs refer 
     to the parental education/guidance component and the amount of 
     intervention carried out by parents. It is possible that the elements 
     chosen by the therapist in a FCFTI depend on characteristics of the 
     child and caregivers.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Lung resection is the standard of care for 
     patients with clinical stage I/II non-small cell lung cancer. This 
     surgery reduces both the duration and quality of patients' daily 
     ambulatory activities 1 month after surgery. However, little is known 
     about physical activity after lung resection in patients with lung 
     cancer. To evaluate the recovery process of physical activity with 
     pulmonary rehabilitation in patients after lung resection and examine 
     whether physical activity is affected by age. Methods. In this 
     prospective, observational study, we measured and analysed 
     participants' postoperative physical activity using a uniaxial 
     accelerometer daily from postoperative day 1 to 30. Findings. We 
     analysed 99 patients who underwent thoracic surgery. The number of 
     walking steps significantly increased until day 4 and then reached a 
     plateau thereafter. The duration of exercise at <3 metabolic 
     equivalents significantly increased until day 3, and no significant 
     difference was observed thereafter. Exercise at >3 metabolic 
     equivalents significantly increased until day 4 and reached a plateau 
     thereafter. A significant correlation was observed between age and 
     number of steps after day 4. Compared with video-assisted 
     thoracoscopic surgery, thoracotomy significantly decreased the number 
     of steps from day 3 to 4. Interpretation. We found that the level of 
     physical activity varied by index in patients with non-small cell 
     lung cancer who underwent lung resection. Age and surgical procedure 
     affect different periods with the increase in post-operative walking 
     steps.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Instrumented measurements of postural 
     control provide a more accurate insight into the motor development of 
     children with autism. This study aimed to identify postural control 
     deficits in autistic children during quiet standing before and after 
     transient locomotor task. It was hypothesized that the parameters 
     that characterize the trajectory of center of foot pressure (COP) 
     displacement would be higher in autistic children compared to 
     typically developing children. Methods. Sixteen autistic children 
     aged 6-10 but without a comorbidity diagnosis, were enrolled in the 
     study group. The control group comprised 16 typically developing 
     peers. The assessment of the transitional task comprised four 
     different conditions: unperturbed and perturbed transition, stepping 
     up, and stepping down tasks. Analysis of the COP signal was carried 
     out for three distinct phases, i.e. phase 1 - quiet standing before 
     step initiation, phase 2 - transit, and phase 3 - quiet standing 
     until measurement completion. Findings. The two-way ANOVA with a 2 × 
     4 factorial design (group × testing condition) revealed a group 
     effect on all posturographic variables in the antero-posterior and 
     medio-lateral directions of phase 1 and in the antero-posterior 
     direction of phase 3. The Bonferroni post-hoc test showed the means 
     of all those variables were significantly higher for the autistic 
     than for typically developing children. Group allocation also had an 
     effect on the time of transit and step length, which turned out to be 
     significantly longer in autistic children compared to healthy peers. 
     Interpretation. Autistic children show increased postural sway before 
     and after transitional locomotor tasks compared to typically 
     developing children.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Lower limb amputation does not affect only 
     physical and psychological functioning but the use of a prosthetic 
     device can also lead to increased cognitive demands. Measuring 
     cognitive load objectively is challenging, and therefore, most 
     studies use questionnaires that are easy to apply but can suffer from 
     subjective bias. Motivated by this, the present study investigated 
     whether a mobile eye tracker can be used to objectively measure 
     cognitive load by monitoring gaze behavior during a set of motor 
     tasks. Methods. Five prosthetic users and eight able-bodied controls 
     participated in this study. Eye tracking data and kinematics were 
     recorded during a set of motor tasks (level ground walking, walking 
     on uneven terrain, obstacle avoidance, stairs up and ramp down, as 
     well as ramp up and stairs down) while the participants were asked to 
     focus their gaze on a visual target for as long as possible. Target 
     fixation times and increase in pupil diameters were determined and 
     correlated to subjective ratings of cognitive load. Findings. 
     Overall, target fixation time and pupil diameter showed strong 
     negative and positive correlations, respectively, to the subjective 
     rating of cognitive load in the able-bodied controls (−0.75 and 
     0.80, respectively). However, the individual correlation strength, 
     and in some cases, even the sign, was different across participants. 
     A similar trend could be observed in prosthetic users. 
     Interpretation. The results of this study showed that a mobile eye 
     tracker may be used to estimate cognitive load in prosthesis users 
     during locomotor tasks. This paves the way to establish a new 
     approach to assessing cognitive load, which is objective and yet 
     practical and simple to administer. Nevertheless, future studies 
     should corroborate these results by comparing them to other objective 
     measures as well as focus on translating the proposed approach 
     outside of a laboratory.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Individuals with a recent anterior cruciate 
     ligament reconstruction may demonstrate an altered movement strategy 
     for protecting the knee and maintaining stability. Altered knee 
     movement might lead to abnormal intra-articular load, potentially 
     contributing to early knee osteoarthritis onset. A protective 
     strategy may be particularly evident during active tasks that induce 
     a pivot-shift manoeuvre, such as a step-down and cross-over task. In 
     this study, we investigated whether knee joint mechanics and muscle 
     activity differed between participants early (~3 months) following 
     reconstruction (n = 35) to uninjured controls (n = 35) during a 
     step-down and cross-over task with a 45° change-of-direction. 
     Methods. We used motion capture, force plates and surface 
     electromyography to compare time-normalised curves of sagittal and 
     transverse-plane knee mechanics and muscle activity during the 
     cross-over phase between groups using functional t-tests. We also 
     compared knee mechanics between sides within the injured group and 
     compared discrete outcomes describing the cross-over phase between 
     groups. Findings. Compared to controls, the injured participants had 
     greater knee flexion angle and moment, lower internal rotation 
     moment, more preparatory foot rotation of the pivoting leg, a smaller 
     cross-over angle, and a longer cross-over phase for both the injured 
     and uninjured sides. The injured leg also had greater biceps femoris 
     and vastus medialis muscle activity compared to controls and 
     different knee mechanics than the uninjured leg. Interpretation. 
     Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction showed a 
     knee-stabilising and pivot-shift avoidance strategy for both legs 
     early in rehabilitation. These results may reflect an altered motor 
     representation and motivate considerations early in rehabilitation.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament is 
     an orthopedic injury that results in neuromuscular impairments 
     affecting sensory input to the central nervous system. Traditional 
     physical therapy after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction aims 
     to rehabilitate orthopedic impairments but fails to address 
     asymmetric gait mechanics that are present post-operatively and are 
     linked to the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. A first 
     step towards developing gait interventions is understanding if 
     individuals after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction have the 
     capacity to learn new walking mechanics. Methods. The split-belt 
     treadmill offers a task-specific approach to examine neuromuscular 
     adaptations in patients after injury. The potential for changing 
     spatiotemporal gait mechanics via split-belt treadmill adaptation has 
     not been tested early after anterior cruciate ligament 
     reconstruction; nor has the ability to retain and transfer newly 
     learned gait mechanics. Therefore, we used a split-belt treadmill 
     paradigm to compare gait adaptation, retention, and transfer to 
     overground walking between 15 individuals 3-9 months after anterior 
     cruciate ligament reconstruction and 15 matched control individuals. 
     Findings. Results suggested individuals after anterior cruciate 
     ligament reconstruction were able to adapt and retain step length 
     symmetry changes as well as controls. There was also evidence of 
     partial transfer to overground walking, similar to controls. 
     Interpretation. Despite disruption in afferent feedback from the 
     joint, individuals early after anterior cruciate ligament 
     reconstruction can learn a new gait pattern using sensorimotor 
     adaptation, retain, and partially transfer the learned gait pattern. 
     This may be a critical time to intervene with gait-specific 
     interventions targeting post-operative gait asymmetries.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The impact of lower-limb-lymphedema on 
     quality of life of patients regarding balance is unclear due to the 
     scarcity of literature. The aim of this study was to determine the 
     static and dynamic balance of patients with lower-limb-lymphedema in 
     comparison with healthy subjects. Methods. This case-control designed 
     study included 30 lymphedema patients and 30 healthy individuals, of 
     whom were 52 female and 8 male with a mean age of 50.63 ± 9.72 
     years. Static balance stability and anterior-posterior with lateral 
     sway parameters on four conditions (eyes-opened-stable-ground, 
     eyes-closed-stable-ground, eyes-opened-unstable-ground, 
     eyes-closed-unstable-ground) and dynamic stability of all 
     participants were evaluated. Findings. The demographic variables were 
     similar between the groups. Majority of the patients had lymphedema 
     due to cancer surgery with a stage of 2. Dynamic stability was 
     significantly disrupted in lymphedema group in comparison with 
     controls (P = 0.049). Static balance parameters were impaired on all 
     conditions except the eyes opened-stable ground in lymphedema 
     patients (P = 0.048,P = 0.043,P = 0.017). The dynamic with static 
     balance and lateral sway parameters were correlated with the duration 
     of lymphedema(P = 0.046,P = 0.002,P = 0.005). Anterior-posterior sway 
     on eyes-closed-unstable-ground condition was correlated with 
     functional status (P = 0.02). Static balance on 
     eyes-opened-unstable-ground condition and anterior-posterior sway 
     parameters were correlated with physical activity level (P = 0.015,P 
     = 0.016,P < 0.05). Interpretation. Closing eyes and the deterioration 
     of ground caused significant alteration of the static and dynamic 
     balance both separately and together in patients with 
     lower-limb-lymphedema compared to healthy subjects. Regarding the 
     static and dynamic imbalance, we suggest the evaluation of balance 
     and inclusion of balance exercises in routine lymphedema 
     rehabilitation program, especially in the early period of disease.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The majority of the ankle osteoarthritis 
     cases are posttraumatic and affect younger patients with a longer 
     projected life span. Hence, joint-preserving surgery, such as 
     supramalleolar osteotomy becomes popular among young patients, 
     especially those with asymmetric arthritis due to alignment 
     deformities. However, there is a lack of biomechanical studies on 
     postoperative evaluation of stress at ankle joints. We aimed to 
     construct a verifiable finite element model of the human hindfoot, 
     and to explore the effect of different osteotomy parameters on the 
     treatment of varus ankle arthritis. Methods. The bones of the 
     hindfoot are reconstructed using normal CT tomography data from 
     healthy volunteers, while the cartilages and ligaments are determined 
     from the literature. The finite element calculation results are 
     compared with the weight-bearing CT (WBCT) data to validate the 
     model. By setting different model parameters, such as the osteotomy 
     height (L) and the osteotomy distraction distance (h), the effects of 
     different surgical parameters on the contact stress of the ankle 
     joint surface are compared. Findings. The alignment and the 
     deformation of hindfoot bones as determined by the finite element 
     analysis aligns closely with the data obtained from WBCT. The maximum 
     contact stress of the ankle joint surface calculated by this model 
     increases with the increase of the varus angle. The maximum contact 
     stresses as a function of the L and h of the ankle joint surface are 
     determined. Interpretation. The relationship between surgical 
     parameters and stress at the ankle joint in our study could further 
     help guiding the planning of the supramalleolar osteotomy according 
     to the varus/valgus alignment of the patients.]

     high priority for patients. In addition, surgeons and patients 
     require objective knowledge of the functional donor-site morbidity. 
     However, the effects of fibular free flap surgery on gait asymmetries 
     have only been studied for step length and stance duration. This 
     study analyses whether patients who have undergone fibular free flap 
     reconstruction have enduring gait asymmetries compared to age-matched 
     controls. Methods. Patients who underwent head and neck 
     reconstruction with fibular free flaps between 2019 and 2023 were 
     recruited, as well as age-matched controls. Participants walked on an 
     instrumented treadmill at 3 km/h. The primary outcome measures were 
     22 gait asymmetry metrics. Secondary outcome measures were the 
     associations of gait asymmetry with the length of the harvested 
     fibula, and with the time after surgery. Findings. Nine out of 13 
     recruited patients completed the full assessment without holding on 
     to the handrail on the treadmill. In addition, nine age-matched 
     controls were enrolled. Twenty out of the 22 gait asymmetry 
     parameters of patients were similar to healthy controls, while 
     push-off peak force (p = 0.008) and medial impulse differed (p = 
     0.003). Gait asymmetry did not correlate with the length of the 
     fibula harvested. Seven gait asymmetry parameters had a strong 
     correlation with the time after surgery. Interpretation. On the 
     long-term, fibular free flap reconstruction has only a limited effect 
     on the asymmetry of force-related and temporal gait parameters while 
     walking on a treadmill.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Falls among the elderly are a major 
     societal problem. While observations of medium-distance walking using 
     inertial sensors identified potential fall predictors, classifying 
     individuals at risk based on single gait cycles remains elusive. This 
     challenge stems from individual variability and step-to-step 
     fluctuations, making accurate classification difficult. Methods. We 
     recruited 44 participants, equally divided into high and low 
     fall-risk groups. A smartphone secured on their second sacral spinous 
     process recorded data during indoor walking. Features were extracted 
     at each gait cycle from a 6-dimensional time series (tri-axial 
     angular velocity and tri-axial acceleration) and classified using the 
     gradient boosting decision tree algorithm. Findings. Mean accuracy 
     across five-fold cross-validation was 0.936. "Age" was the most 
     influential individual feature, while features related to 
     acceleration in the gait direction held the highest total relative 
     importance when aggregated by axis (0.5365). Interpretation. 
     Combining acceleration, angular velocity data, and the gradient 
     boosting decision tree algorithm enabled accurate fall risk 
     classification in the elderly, previously challenging due to lack of 
     discernible features. We reveal the first-ever identification of 
     three-dimensional pelvic motion characteristics during single gait 
     cycles in the high-risk group. This novel method, requiring only one 
     gait cycle, is valuable for individuals with physical limitations 
     hindering repetitive or long-distance walking or for use in spaces 
     with limited walking areas. Additionally, utilizing readily available 
     smartphones instead of dedicated equipment has potential to improve 
     gait analysis accessibility.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Reduced ankle quasi-joint stiffness affects 
     propulsion in the paretic side of patients with hemiparesis, 
     contributing to gait asymmetry. We investigated whether the use of an 
     ankle-foot orthosis with dorsiflexion resistance to compensate for 
     reduced stiffness would increase quasi-joint stiffness and 
     spatiotemporal symmetry in patients with hemiparesis. Methods. 
     Seventeen patients walked along a 7-m walkway in both ankle-foot 
     orthosis with dorsiflexion resistance and control (i.e. ankle-foot 
     orthosis) conditions. Dorsiflexion resistance by spring and cam was 
     set to increase linearly from zero-degree ankle dorsiflexion. Gait 
     data were analyzed using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. 
     Findings. Ankle-foot orthosis with dorsiflexion resistance 
     significantly increased the quasi-joint stiffness in the early and 
     middle stance phase (P = 0.028 and 0.040). Furthermore, although 
     ankle power generation in the ankle-foot orthosis with dorsiflexion 
     resistance condition was significantly lower than in the control 
     condition (P = 0.003), step length symmetry significantly increased 
     in the ankle-foot orthosis with dorsiflexion resistance condition (P 
     = 0.016). There was no significant difference in swing time ratio 
     between conditions.. Interpretation. Applying dorsiflexion resistance 
     in the paretic stance phase increased quasi-joint stiffness but did 
     not lead to an increase in ankle power generation. On the other hand, 
     applying dorsiflexion resistance also resulted in a more symmetrical 
     step length, even though the ankle joint power generation on the 
     paretic side did not increase as expected. Future research should 
     explore whether modifying the magnitude and timing of dorsiflexion 
     resistance, considering the biomechanical characteristics of each 
     patients' ankle joint during gait, enhances ankle joint power 
     generation.]

     ankle kinematics during gait in schoolchildren with acute 
     lymphoblastic leukemia with clinically suspected peripheral 
     neuropathy. Methods. In children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 
     the maintenance phase, we calculated spatiotemporal and kinematic 
     parameters of the ankle during gait using Kinovea® software. 
     Furthermore, we identified alterations in the parameters obtained 
     considering the values of the normality data from a 
     stereophotogrammetry system as the reference values. Finally, we 
     represented the kinematic parameters of the ankles calculated with 
     Kinovea® compared to the normality values of the 
     stereophotogrammetry. Findings. We evaluated 25 schoolchildren; 13 
     were male (52.0%) with a median age of 88.0months and a median of 
     60.0 weeks in the maintenance phase, and 54.8% were classified as 
     standard risk. Spatiotemporal parameters: cadence (steps/min), 
     bilateral step length (m), and average gait speed (m/s) in ALL 
     children were significantly lower than reference values (p < 0.001). 
     Except for right mid-stance and bilateral foot strike, initial swing 
     showed that both ankles maintained plantar flexion values during 
     gait, significantly lower in ALL patients (p < 0.05). Interpretation. 
     We identified spatiotemporal and kinematics alterations in 
     schoolchildren with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during all phases of 
     the gait suggestive of alteration in ankle muscles during movement, 
     probably due to peripheral neuropathy; nevertheless, our results 
     should be taken with caution until the accuracy and reliability of 
     Kinovea® software as a diagnostic test compared to the 
     stereophotogrammetric system in children with ALL and healthy peers 
     is proven.]

     Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) approach in 
     improving the occupational performance goals of children and young 
     people with executive function deficits after acquired brain injury 
     (ABI) (e.g. etiologies such as stroke, encephalitis, brain tumor, and 
     traumatic brain injury). Method. A replicated single-case 
     experimental study using a randomized multiple baseline design across 
     participants and goals was used. Three clusters of four participants 
     (12 participants, nine males and three females, aged 8-16 years) were 
     included. The intervention consisted of 14 individual CO-OP sessions. 
     Each participant chose four goals; three goals were trained during 
     the intervention sessions and a fourth goal served as the control. 
     The Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) was used as a repeated measure to 
     determine goal achievement while the Canadian Occupational 
     Performance Measure (COPM) was used to identify the perceived goal 
     achievement of children, young people, and their parents. Results. 
     For 26 of the 35 trained goals, the intervention led to statistically 
     significant improvements in the GAS. Perceived occupational 
     performance and satisfaction improved significantly for the trained 
     goals (30 out of 35 goals for the COPM performance and satisfaction 
     of participants; 26 out 31 goals for the COPM performance of parents; 
     24 out of 31 goals for the COPM satisfaction of parents) and were 
     maintained at the follow-up. Almost all COPM control goal results 
     were significant, but these changes were not supported by the GAS 
     measures or the statistical analysis. Interpretation. The generally 
     positive results of this study provide evidence of the benefits of 
     using the CO-OP approach with this population.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Predicting the risk associated with 
     vascular surgery in older adult patients has become increasingly 
     challenging, primarily due to limitations in existing risk assessment 
     tools. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of gait speed, a 
     clinical indicator of frailty, in enhancing the prediction of 
     mortality and morbidity in older adult patients undergoing vascular 
     surgery. Methods: A single-center prospective cohort study was 
     conducted, involving older adult patients undergoing vascular surgery 
     at four tertiary care hospitals between 2021 and 2022. Eligible 
     patients were aged 80 years or older and scheduled for surgical 
     treatment of peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs (IIb 
     Leriche-Le Fontaine). The primary factor of interest was gait speed, 
     defined as taking more than 6 s to walk 5 meters. The primary 
     outcomes were in-hospital postoperative mortality and major 
     morbidity. Results. The cohort comprised 131 patients with a mean age 
     of 82.8 ± 1.4 years, with 34 % being female. Before vascular 
     surgery, 60 patients (46 %) were categorized as slow walkers. Slow 
     walkers were more likely to be female (43 % vs. 25 %, p < 0.03) and 
     diabetic (50 % vs. 28 %, p < 0.01). Among the patients, 30 (23 %) 
     experienced the primary composite outcome of mortality or major 
     morbidity following vascular surgery. After adjusting for the 
     American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement 
     Program (ACS NSQIP®) Surgical Risk Calculator, slow gait speed 
     independently predicted the composite outcome (odds ratio: 3.05; 95 % 
     confidence interval: 1.23 to 7.54). Conclusions. Gait speed is a 
     straightforward and effective test that can help identify a subgroup 
     of frail older adult patients at an elevated and incremental risk of 
     mortality and major morbidity after vascular surgery. While gait 
     speed remains a valuable clinical indicator of frailty, it is 
     important to recognize that the broader context of mobility plays a 
     pivotal role in postoperative outcomes.]

     transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. This study 
     aimed to explore the impact of virtual reality (VR) on enhancing 
     cognitive flexibility, working memory, and daily life activities. 
     Forty participants diagnosed with MCI were randomly assigned to 
     either an intervention group (N = 20) or a control group (N = 20). 
     Evaluations were at baseline, post-training, and three months 
     post-training using various cognitive assessment tools. Results 
     showed that the VR-based cognitive rehabilitation significantly 
     improved instrumental activities of daily living performance, visual 
     and verbal working memory, and reduced anxiety and depression 
     symptoms. While cognitive flexibility did not exhibit significant 
     improvement, these findings highlight VR interventions as a potential 
     avenue for improving cognitive and functional aspects, and 
     alleviating psychological symptoms in individuals with MCI. Further 
     research with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods is 
     recommended to establish the long-term effectiveness of such

     indicated that the combined intervention had a better impact on 
     reducing dyspnea-related kinesiophobia than did routine nursing 
     (P<0.05), and the impact persisted even after the intervention. 
     Additionally, it may enhance dyspnea and quality of life, increase

     quality of life and can be life-threatening. However, the knowledge, 
     attitudes and preventive behaviors of osteoporosis in older adults 
     are insufficient. The aim of this paper was to develop and test the

     convenience sample of 85 older adults recruited from two community 
     activity centers in southern Taiwan were assigned to either an 
     experimental group or a control group. The experimental group played 
     a bone-preserving board game for 4 weeks, and the control group 
     participated in routine community center activities. The generalized 
     estimating equation showed significantly larger improvements in 
     knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behaviors in the experimental 
     group than in the control group. Board games designed for older 
     adults can support public health education and help prevent 
     osteoporosis. Our results provide a reference for educators, clinical 
     practitioners and researchers. Osteoporosis is a silent disease 
     without obvious symptoms. Osteoporosis can cause health problems, and 
     preventing osteoporosis in older adults is necessary. The knowledge,

     AB: Abstract. Aims. To explore the relationship between health 
     personality and quality of life among community-dwelling older adults 
     and to examine the mediating effect of eHealth literacy on this 
     relationship. Methods. A total of 413 community-dwelling older adults 
     from central China were recruited from September 2022 to January 
     2023. A cross-sectional investigation was conducted using the Chinese 
     versions of the Health Personality Assessment (HPA), eHealth Literacy 
     Scale (eHEALS), and 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). 
     Correlations between the three variables were examined by Pearson 
     analysis, and mediation analysis was conducted to explore the direct, 
     indirect, and total effects of the health personality on quality of 
     life vis-à-vis eHealth literacy. Results. Health personality factors 
     (including health neuroticism, health openness, and health 
     conscientiousness), eHealth literacy, and quality of life are 
     significantly correlated (P<0.05); eHealth literacy can play a 
     significant mediating role in the relationship between health 
     neuroticism (β= -0.256, 95 %CI: [-0.405, -0.119]), health openness 
     (β = 0.488, 95 % CI: [0.343,0.652]), health conscientiousness (β= 
     0.489, 95 % CI: [0.354, 0.634]) and quality of life. Conclusion. This 
     study revealed that the effect of health personality factors 
     (including health neuroticism, health openness, and health 
     conscientiousness) on quality of life in older adults was mediated 
     through eHealth literacy. Impact. Individual personality is essential 
     to understanding eHealth literacy and quality of life among 
     community-dwelling older adults. It may be helpful to identify the 
     health personality traits of older adults first, then implement 
     targeted interventions accordingly to enhance eHealth literacy and 
     ultimately improve quality of life.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. This study aimed to examine associations 
     between the employment of older people and mental health across 
     demographic characteristics, socioeconomic conditions, and health 
     status, with a focus on pensions. Methods. This study included 4,512 
     participants aged 60-69 from the CLASS in 2014. A multiple linear 
     regression was conducted to investigate the association between 
     employment and mental health. A causal forest model was applied to 
     estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects. Results. Employed 
     individuals (n = 1,295) reported better mental health than their 
     non-employed counterparts. This association displayed significant 
     heterogeneity, primarily attributed to pensions. Those with lower 
     pensions may be compelled to work due to financial reasons, thus 
     offsetting the health-promotion effect of employment. Conclusion. 
     Employment may benefit the mental health of older adults, which has a 
     more significant marginal effect on those who are men, older, urban 
     residents, without a spouse, below primary education, receiving more 
     pensions, and less family and friend support.]

     study examined the mediating effect of resilience on the relationship 
     between care stressors and perceived caregiving stress. Methods. Data 
     were based on 234 older adults with disabilities and their caregivers 
     from 6 urban districts and 6 rural counties from Jinan, China. 
     Descriptive analysis, analysis of variance, ordinary least squares 
     regression, and mediation analysis were performed. Results. Perceived 
     stress among family caregivers of Chinese older adults with 
     disabilities was affected by the physical and mental health of both 
     themselves and the care recipients, as well as care intensity and 
     financial difficulties. Resilience played a partial mediating role in 
     the associations among three stressors (i.e. older adults' disability 
     levels, number of chronic diseases, and caregivers' self-reported 
     mental) and perceived caregiving stress. Conclusions. Enhanced 
     resilience aids caregivers' adaptation to their roles, suggesting the 
     need for societal, spiritual, emotional, and behavioral resilience

     AB: Abstract. Emerging evidence suggests that 40 Hz auditory 
     stimulation may benefit cognition. Nested within a randomized 
     crossover trial, this qualitative study evaluates the acceptability 
     and experience of three auditory interventions-self-selected music, 
     40 Hz sound, and a novel combination, termed 40 Hz music-in 
     individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Semi-structured 
     interviews were conducted with individuals with MCI post-intervention 
     exposure. Findings indicated a preference for self-selected music due 
     to its memory-boosting and emotional benefits, while responses to 40 
     Hz sound were mixed, with several participants reporting discomfort. 
     The composite 40 Hz music intervention showed promise, striking a 
     balance by enhancing user experience and mitigating the 40 Hz sound's 
     negative aspects. Engagement was influenced by personal music 
     interests, listening routines, and support networks. This study 
     highlights the potential of integrating 40 Hz sound with personalized 
     music to offer a more acceptable 40 Hz auditory intervention for 
     cognition in older adults with MCI.]

     AB: Abstract. Despite the increasing use of music therapy to treat 
     patients with dementia, studies focused on developing nations are 
     still in their embryonic stages. In this view, this study examined 
     the impact of group music therapy intervention in ameliorating 
     depression levels among older people in two care homes. A randomized 
     control trial (RCT) was carried out in which a total of 121 patients 
     were randomly divided into control 61 and experimental group 60. 
     After 6 weeks, 12-session experiment which involved passive and 
     active music therapy, it was found that music group therapy 
     intervention reduced the depression level of older persons in the 
     experimental group, compared to those who were not exposed to the 
     music therapy; control group. The music therapy session also 
     influenced the salivary cortisol of the patients as it was shown to 
     reduce their salivary cortisol levels. It was also observed that 
     after three months of follow-up, participants in the experimental 
     group still maintained a low level of depression and salivary 
     cortisol level, but the control group's level was still high, thus, 
     substantiating the effect of music in reducing depression among older 
     people. We encouraged clinicians, nursing practitioners and care 
     homes in Nigeria to incorporate music therapy as part of the 
     treatment offered to patients with dementia.]

     impact of spiritual reminiscence therapy (SRT) on depression and hope 
     among older adults living in Shahroud, northeast of Iran. One hundred 
     fifty-six older adults were selected through convenience sampling and 
     assigned non-randomly to the intervention (n = 78) and control (n = 
     78) groups. The data collection tools included the Geriatric 
     Depression Scale and Adult Hope Scale. For the intervention group, 
     SRT was conducted in six weekly sessions, each lasting 60 to 90 min, 
     over six weeks. The data were analyzed utilizing descriptive 
     statistics and inferential tests (independent t-test, Chi-square 
     test, and analysis of covariance). The two groups' post-intervention 
     mean scores on depression (t = 11.63 and P < 0.001), and hope (t = 
     4.41 and P < 0.001) were statistically different, suggesting that SRT 
     positively affected older adults by alleviating despair and boosting 
     hope. The findings indicate that engaging in SRT can be beneficial in 
     reducing depression and fostering hope among older adults.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. To describe the mechanisms and visual 
     outcomes of recreational and sports-related open globe injuries 
     (OGIs). Methods. A retrospective case series of eyes experiencing OGI 
     secondary to recreational and sports-related activities at Memorial 
     Hermann Hospital - Texas Medical Center (MHH-TMC) from January 1st, 
     2010 through March 31st, 2015 was conducted. Exclusionary criteria 
     included no documented ophthalmologic examination upon presentation 
     and repairs performed by services other than ophthalmology. A 
     two-tailed t-test and Fisher's exact test were utilized to assess for 
     statistical significance (p < 0.05). Results. A total of 20 eyes from 
     20 patients experiencing OGIs secondary to recreational and 
     sports-related activities were included. Thirteen eyes (65 %) 
     presented with OGIs from penetrating objects while seven eyes (35 %) 
     had injuries from blunt injuries. Males comprised most of the total 
     study group (17 of 20 patients), and zone 3 injuries were the most 
     common location of OGI. While eyes with OGIs from blunt trauma 
     underwent evisceration/enucleation procedures more frequently than 
     OGIs from penetrating mechanisms (71% vs 23 %) (p = 0.10), the final 
     visual outcomes were similarly poor between groups. Only three eyes 
     in this series experienced an improvement from baseline VA; all three 
     eyes had lacked initial findings consistent with severe injury. 
     Conclusions. Recreational and sports related OGIs most commonly occur 
     in zone 3 and in young males, regardless of injury type. OGIs due to 
     both penetrating and blunt trauma mechanisms implicate poor 
     functional outcomes, but the absence of certain presenting injury 
     features may indicate possibility of eventual visual recovery.]

     a mental illness who have achieved clinical recovery in their 
     personal recovery. Understanding the relationship between self-stigma 
     and social support and the effects on perceived recovery can be 
     valuable for clinical professionals in helping patients lead 
     meaningful lives. Aim. To examine the serial mediating roles of 
     social support and perceived hope in self-stigma and the effects on 
     perceived recovery. Design. A cross-sectional study. Methods. The 
     study was conducted from September 2019 to June 2020. One hundred and 
     fifty-seven patients with schizophrenia in seven chronic 
     rehabilitation wards were enrolled. Each patient had a Positive and 
     Negative Syndrome Scale score ≤ 60 points, and they regularly 
     participated in occupational rehabilitation. Research tools included 
     demographic data, the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale 
     (ISMIS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), 
     Herth Hope Index (HHI), and Perceived Recovery Inventory (PRI). IBM 
     SPSS 24.0 was used to analyse the data. Pearson correlation was used 
     to analyse the relationships between variables, and models 4 and 6 of 
     PROCESS macro V3.4 for SPSS were used to examine the mediation model. 
     Results. The results indicated that self-stigma and perceived 
     recovery in patients with schizophrenia are negatively correlated, 
     that peer support and perceived hope mediate the relationship between 
     them, and that peer support and perceived hope also have a 
     statistically significant serial mediating effect. Conclusion. The 
     serial mediation effect of peer support and perceived hope on the 
     relationship between self-stigma and perceived recovery was 
     statistically significant in this study. Impact. This research delves 
     into strategies to assist psychiatric patients in reducing 
     self-stigma and achieving recovery. The findings underscore the 
     heightened significance of peer support for patients in 
     rehabilitative wards and offer valuable insights for medical staff.]

     production of the central-peninsular Spanish alveolar sibilant 
     fricative /s/. Method. To this end, production of the sibilant was 
     analyzed in 20 subjects with dysarthria, 8 with apraxia of speech and 
     28 healthy speakers. Participants produced 12 sV(C) words. The 
     variables compared across groups were the fricative's spectral 
     amplitude difference (AmpD) and spectral moments in the temporal 
     midpoint of fricative execution. Results. The results indicate that 
     individuals with dysarthria can be distinguished from healthy 
     speakers in terms of the spectral characteristics AmpD, standard 
     deviation (SD), center of gravity (CoG) and skewness, the last two in 
     context with unrounded vowel, while no differences in kurtosis were 
     detected. Participants with AoS group differ significantly from 
     healthy speaker group in AmpD, SD and CoG and Kurtosis, the first one 
     followed unrounded vowel and the latter two followed by rounded 
     vowels. In addition, speakers with apraxia of speech group returned 
     significant differences with respect to speakers with dysarthria 
     group in AmpD, CoG and skewness. Conclusions. The differences found 
     between the groups in the measures studied as a function of the type 
     of vowel context could provide insights into the distinctive 
     manifestations of motor speech disorders, contributing to the 
     differential diagnosis between apraxia and dysarthria in motor

     AB: Abstract. Background. Treadmill belt-accelerations are a commonly 
     utilised surrogate for tripping, but their physiological validity is 
     unknown. This study examined if a treadmill belt-acceleration induces 
     lower limb muscle activation responses similar to a trip on a 
     walkway. Methods. 38 older people (65+ years) experienced one 
     treadmill belt-acceleration and one walkway obstacle trip in random 
     order. Muscle responses were assessed bilaterally using surface 
     electromyography on the rectus femoris (RF), tibialis anterior (TA), 
     semitendinosus (ST) and gastrocnemius medial head (GM). Unperturbed 
     muscle activity, post-perturbation onset latency, peak magnitude, 
     time to peak and co-contraction index (CCI) were examined. Results. 
     Muscle activity in the right ST was greater during unperturbed 
     walking on the treadmill compared to walkway (P=0.011). Compared to a 
     treadmill belt-acceleration, a walkway trip elicited faster onset 
     latencies in all muscles; greater peak magnitudes in the left RF, TA, 
     GM and right GM; faster time to peaks in the left TA and right GM; 
     and lower knee and ankle muscle CCI (P<0.05). Conclusions. Walkway 
     trips and treadmill belt-accelerations elicit distinct muscle 
     activation patterns. While walkway trips induced faster and larger 
     muscle responses, treadmill belt-accelerations involved greater 
     co-contraction. Therefore, treadmill belt-accelerations may not 
     accurately simulate the muscle responses to trips.]

     osteoarthritis (OA) and an asymptomatic older adult group. A 
     secondary objective was to compare frontal and sagittal plane moment 
     and sagittal plane motion features between groups. Scope: 84 
     individuals with moderate knee OA (61 ± 6 years, 43 % female, BMI

     49 % female, BMI 25.0 ± 3.4 kg/m2) participated. Participants walked 
     at a self-selected pace on a dual belt treadmill. Surface 
     electromyograms of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius, 
     segment motions and ground reaction forces were recorded. Principal 
     component analyses identified amplitude and temporal electromyogram 
     features. Sagittal plane motion and net external sagittal and frontal 
     plane moments were calculated. Analysis of Variance models using 
     Bonferroni corrections determined between and within group 
     differences in these gait features. Conclusions. The contralateral 
     knee showed prolonged lateral hamstring activation and altered 
     temporal features of the gastrocnemius and greater knee adduction 
     moments compared to asymptomatic adults. Group, muscle, or 
     interaction effects were not found for the quadriceps. These findings

     were calculated as predictor variables, while peak and cumulative low 
     back moments were calculated as dependent measures. Multiple 
     regression revealed that 56.6-59.2% of variance in low back moments 
     was explained by predictor variables. From these regression models, 
     generating motion with the legs (both greater hip and knee work), 
     minimizing the horizontal distance of the body to the load, 
     maintaining a stable body position, and minimizing lift time were 
     associated with lower magnitudes of low back moments. These data 
     support that using cues targeting these identified variables may be 
     more effective at reducing peak low back moment exposures via lift 
     training.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. This study evaluated motor control recovery at 
     different times following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction 
     (ACLR) by investigating lower-limb spatiotemporal symmetry during 
     stair descent performances. Methods. We used a cross-sectional design 
     to compare asymptomatic athletes (Controls, n = 18) with a group of 
     people with ACLR (n = 49) divided into three time-from-ACLR subgroups 
     (Early: <6 months, n = 17; Mid: 6-18 months, n = 16; Late: ≥18 
     months, n = 16). We evaluated: "temporal symmetry" during the stance 
     subphases (single-support, first and second double-support) and 
     "spatial symmetry" for hip-knee-ankle intra-joint angular 
     displacements during the stance phase using a dissimilarity index 
     applied on superimposed 3D phase plots. Results. We found significant 
     between-group differences in temporal variables (p ≤ 0.001). 
     Compared to Controls, both Early and Mid (p ≤ 0.05) showed 
     asymmetry in the first double-support time (longer for their injured 
     vs. non-injured leg), while Early generally also showed longer 
     durations in all other phases, regardless of stepping leg. No 
     statistically significant differences were found for spatial 
     intra-joint symmetry between groups. Conclusion. Temporal but not 
     spatial asymmetry in stair descent is often present early after ACLR; 
     it may remain for up to 18 months and may underlie subtle intra- and 
     inter-joint compensations. Spatial asymmetry may need further 
     exploration.]

     AB: Abstract. Lumbar fusion is a risk factor for hip dislocation 
     following total hip arthroplasty (THA). The objective was to compare 
     joint/segment angles during sit-stand-sit in participants that had a 
     THA with and without a lumbar fusion. The secondary objective was to 
     compare pain, physical function, disability, and quality of life. 
     This cross-sectional study includes participants that had THA and 
     lumbar fusion (THA-fusion; n = 12) or THA only (THA-only; n = 12). 
     Participants completed sit-stand-sit trials. Joint/segment angles 
     were measured using electromagnetic motion capture. Angle 
     characteristics were determined using principal component analysis. 
     Hierarchical linear models examined relationships between angle 
     characteristics and groups. Pain, physical function, and disability 
     were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Upper lumbar spine was more 
     extended during sit-stand-sit in the THA-fusion group (b = 42.41, P = 
     0.04). The pelvis was more posteriorly and anteriorly tilted during 
     down and end sit-stand-sit phases, respectively, in the THA-fusion 
     group (b = 12.21, P = 0.03). There were no significant associations 
     between group and other angles. THA-fusion group had worse pain, 
     physical function, disability, and quality of life. Although 
     differences in spine joint, pelvis segment, and hip joint angles 
     existed, these findings are unlikely to account for the increased 
     incidence of hip dislocation after total hip arthroplasty in patients 
     that had spine fusion.]

     AB: Abstract. Individuals who have undergone anterior cruciate 
     ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are at greater risk of developing knee 
     osteoarthritis (OA). This elevated risk of knee OA is associated with 
     high tibiofemoral (TF) compressive force, due to a combination of low 
     knee flexion angles and increased co-contraction of the hamstrings 
     and quadriceps during limb loading. Prolonged vibration of the 
     hamstrings fatigues the intrafusal muscle fibers, which reduces 
     autonomic reflexive excitation of the hamstrings and alleviates 
     reciprocal inhibition to the quadriceps. The aim of this study was to 
     examine the effect of prolonged hamstrings vibration on TF 
     compressive force in individuals who have undergone ACL 
     reconstruction. Fourteen participants with unilateral ACLR and 14 
     participants without knee injury performed a single-leg drop-land 
     task before and after prolonged (20 min) vibration of the hamstrings. 
     Peak TF compressive force, knee flexion angle, and 
     hamstrings/quadriceps co-contraction were calculated during the 
     deceleration phase of the drop-land task before and after vibration. 
     The ACLR group experienced an 18% decrease in TF compressive force, a 
     32% increase in knee flexion angle, and a 38% decrease in 
     hamstrings/quadriceps co-contraction after hamstrings vibration. 
     There was no difference in any of the parameters in the noninjured 
     group after vibration. These data suggest that acute prolonged 
     hamstrings vibration has the potential to mitigate TF compressive 
     force, which may protect the knee joint in the long term. Clinical 
     significance: The results of this research are expected to lead to 
     improved clinical care for ACLR patients because it holds promise for 
     mitigating altered joint mechanics and perhaps slowing down the onset 
     of posttraumatic knee osteoarthritis.]

     AB: Abstract. Shelf acetabuloplasty has been performed in patients 
     with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH); however, the 
     appropriate position of the shelf has not been determined, 
     particularly with respect to avoiding range of motion (ROM) loss. The 
     aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of ROM inhibition 
     and the influence of 3D position of the shelf following actual shelf 
     acetabuloplasty and virtual surgery using computer simulation 
     analysis. Computed tomography data from 15 patients with DDH who 
     underwent shelf acetabuloplasty were collected between August 2019 
     and February 2022. The three-dimensional models of a hip joint were 
     constructed using Zed Hip®. Maximal internal rotation (MIR) at 45° 
     and 90° flexion was measured in each patient. The frequency and 
     position of ROM inhibition was determined in a real postoperative 
     model virtually. In addition, a second analysis using virtual 
     acetabuloplasty was performed. Upon placing the shelf, three patterns 
     were provided for the following four parameters: height, coronal 
     inclination, center-edge angle (CEA), and anteroposterior position. 
     The predictors for ROM inhibition were analyzed using a logistic 
     regression model. In the actual postoperative model, a limitation of 
     MIR at 90° and 45° of flexion occurred in 60% and 66.7% of 
     patients, respectively. A higher CEA and anterior position are major 
     factors limiting MIR. The analysis of the virtual shelf 
     acetabuloplasty model revealed that anterior position and CEA were 
     significant factors causing ROM inhibition. As for clinical 
     significance, the results of the current study indicated the optimal 
     location of the shelf to avoid iatrogenic impingement after shelf 
     acetabuloplasty.]

     AB: Abstract. There is limited data quantifying the influence of 
     running on hip cartilage mechanics. The goal of this investigation 
     was to quantify changes in hip joint bone-to-bone distance in 
     response to a 3-mile treadmill run. We acquired magnetic resonance 
     (MR) images of the dominant hip of eight young, asymptomatic runners 
     (five males, three females) before and immediately after they ran 3 
     miles at a self-selected pace on a level treadmill. The femoral heads 
     and acetabula were semiautomatically segmented from the pre- and 
     post-exercise MR images to generate three-dimensional models of each 
     participant's hip that were used to compute changes in the 
     bone-to-bone distances incurred by the running exercise. We observed 
     a significant 3% decrease in bone-to-bone distance from 3.47 ± 0.20 
     to 3.36 ± 0.22 mm between the femoral head and acetabulum after a 
     3-mile treadmill run (mean ± 95% confidence interval; p = 0.03). 
     These findings provide new baseline data describing how running 
     impacts the hip joint in young, asymptomatic runners.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Exercise is an effective intervention for 
     obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, the effects of exercise on 
     objective sleep architecture in patients with OSA remain unknown. 
     This meta-analysis aimed to collect data from randomized controlled 
     trials of exercise interventions in patients with OSA, with a 
     specific focus on objective sleep parameters derived from 
     polysomnography. Methods. Randomized control trials that targeted 
     patients with OSA aged > 18 years, measured sleep using 
     polysomnography after exercise programs, and reported the proportion 
     of sleep stages were included for meta-analysis. Bias was assessed 
     using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and funnel plots. The 
     random effects model was applied. Results. Six studies with a total 
     of 236 patients were included in the meta-analysis. There were no 
     significant differences in the total sleep time (TST), sleep 
     efficiency, sleep onset latency, stage N1 sleep, or rapid eye 
     movement sleep between the exercise and control groups. Participation 
     in an exercise program lasting > 12 weeks significantly decreased 
     stage N2 and increased stage N3 sleep as observed in the subgroup 
     analysis. Although this tendency did not reach statistical 
     significance in the total-group analysis, it was significant after 
     excluding the possible confounding effects of heart disease. 
     Conclusions. The exercise program decreased N2 and increased N3 
     proportions over the TST among patients with OSA, which may 
     correspond to subjective sleep quality. The beneficial effects were 
     significant when the program lasted > 12 weeks and after excluding 
     the confounding effects of heart disease. Exercise program duration 
     should be considered when providing clinical advice.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. Commercially available wearable activity 
     monitors can promote physical activity behaviour. Clinical trials 
     typically quantify physical activity with research grade activity 
     monitors prior to testing interventions utilising commercially 
     available wearable activity monitors aimed at increasing step count. 
     Therefore, it is important to test the agreement of these two types 
     of activity monitors. Objectives. Observational. Methods. Thirty 
     adults (20-65 years, n = 19 females) were provided a Fitbit Charge 
     4©. To determine reliability using an intraclass correlation 
     coefficient, two, one-minute bouts of treadmill walking were 
     performed at a self-selected pace. Subsequently, participants wore 
     both an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT and the Fitbit for seven days. To 
     determine agreement, statistical equivalence and the mean absolute 
     percentage error were calculated and represented graphically with a 
     Bland-Altman plot. Ordinary least products regression was performed 
     to identify fixed or proportional bias. Results. The Fitbit showed 
     'good' step count reliability on the treadmill (intraclass 
     correlation coefficient = 0.75, 95 % CI = 0.53-0.87, p < 0.001). In 
     free-living however, it overestimated step count when compared to the 
     ActiGraph wGT3X-BT (mean absolute percentage error = 26.02 % ± 
     14.63). Measurements did not fall within the ± 10 % equivalence 
     region and proportional bias was apparent (slope 95 % CI = 
     1.09-1.35). Conclusions. The Fitbit Charge 4© is reliable when 
     measuring step count on a treadmill. However, there is an 
     overestimation of daily steps in free-living environments which may 
     falsely indicate compliance with physical activity recommendations.]

     Methods. Fifty-four participants aged 21-55 years were randomised 
     into three groups; 1) non-exercise control (n = 18), 2) standardised 
     moderate-intensity continuous training (n = 18), or 3) individualised 
     moderate-intensity continuous training + high-intensity interval 
     training (n = 18). The fitness-fatness index was calculated by 
     dividing cardiorespiratory fitness (expressed as metabolic 
     equivalents) by the waist-to-height ratio. Participants were 
     classified as likely responders to the intervention if a change of 1 
     fitness-fatness index unit was achieved. Results. The individualised 
     group showed the greatest fitness-fatness index improvement (between 
     group difference p < 0.001), with 100 % of this group classified as 
     likely responders, compared to the standardised (68 %) and

     changes in the fitness-fatness index than a standardised exercise

     study. Methods. Simulated skiing tests were conducted indoors 
     involving 10 skiers with unilateral transfemoral amputation and 10 
     able-bodied participants. A Paralympic silver medalist performed 
     slalom skiing tests on snow. These tests were conducted with and 
     without additional strapping on the residual limb. Surface 
     electromyography of trunk muscles and athletic performance was 
     measured, and the asymmetry index was calculated. Results. Athletes 
     were significantly dependent on muscle activation on the dominant 
     side (asymmetry index = 7.8 %-28.3 %, p < 0.05). Worse athletic 
     performance to the dominant side was found based on inclination 
     angles of the indoor board (asymmetry index = − 9.8 %, p = 0.014) 
     and outdoor sit ski (− 11.1 %, p = 0.006), and distance to the gate 
     poles during skiing turns (18.6 %, p < 0.001). After using additional 
     restraints, the above asymmetry index declined significantly 
     (asymmetry index < 4.5 %, p < 0.05). Furthermore, athletic 
     performance was significantly improved on both body sides by 11.1 
     %-30.7 % (p < 0.05). Conclusions. Unilateral transfemoral amputation 
     caused the dependence on the trunk muscles of the dominant side and 
     the corresponding unilateral poor performance in athletes. Adjusting 
     restraints in the human-equipment interface by additional strapping 
     could mitigate the asymmetry issues and improve athletic 
     performance.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Progressive systemic sclerosis or systemic 
     scleroderma (SS) is a chronic and rare autoimmune disease that mainly 
     affects the skin and various internal organs. Raynaud's phenomenon 
     and digital ulcers are some of the symptoms that affect the foot, 
     causing a decrease in the quality of life of patients. The objective 
     of this study is to determine the functionality of the feet in 
     patients with SS and determine the impact on their daily lives. 
     Methods. A sample of 165 patients (154 women, 11 men) diagnosed with 
     SS with a mean age of 46.29 ± 11.36 years and a mean body mass index 
     (BMI) of 24.90 ± 5.77 was recruited. Each participant completed the 
     Foot Function Index (FFI) questionnaire and the Systemic Sclerosis 
     Questionnaire (SySQ). A multivariate analysis was performed to 
     determine which factors were related to a higher score in both 
     questionnaires. Results. 32.1% of the participants (n = 53) had claw 
     toe deformities, 79.4% (n = 131) Raynaud's disease and 20% (n = 33) a 
     history of foot ulcers. 51.5% of the participants (n = 85) presented 
     symptoms in their nails, the most frequent sign being thickening, 
     hardening and yellow coloration. The final score of the FFI 
     questionnaire was 3.51 ± 2.41 (0-9.9), the pain subscale being the 
     highest, with a score of 5.06 ± 2.75, followed by foot disability 
     (3.26 ± 2.91) and difficulty performing activities (1.55 ± 2.22). 
     The final score of the SySQ questionnaire was 0.95 ± 0.45 
     (0.18-2.45), and the subscales with the highest score were symptom 
     frequency (1.30 ± 0.47), symptom intensity (1.11 ± 0.55), and 
     general skill limitation (0.47 ± 0.51). A high correlation was 
     observed between the final FFI score and the final SySQ score (r = 
     0.712; p=<0.001). Also, between foot activity limitation and general 
     skill limitation (r = 0.658; p=<0.001). A moderate correlation was 
     observed between foot pain score and overall symptom intensity (r = 
     0.482; p=<0.001). Also, between foot disability and overall symptom 
     frequency (r = 0.556; p=<0.001). The multivariate analysis (R2 0.51) 
     showed that the final FFI score had a significant relationship with 
     the final SySQ score (p < 0.001). No significant correlation was 
     found between age (p = 0.15), gender (p = 0.49), BMI (p = 0.74) or 
     time of diagnosis (p = 0.57) and FFI. Conclusion. SS is a disease 
     that affects foot functionality in patients, with a greater impact on 
     the pain scale. There is a correlation between the final FFI score 
     and the final SySQ score, so improving foot functionality could help 
     to improve the overall functionality of the patient with sclerosis.]

     were compared before and after the treatment. Results. The baseline 
     wound pH value in 76.4% of the patients was in the alkaline range and 
     was closely related to the degree of infection (P < 0.05). As the 
     ulcers healed, the pH decreased. For moderately and severely infected 
     diabetic foot ulcers, each unit decrease in pH was associated with a 
     decrease in the PUSH score of approximately 4.6 points (P < 0.05). 
     The pH values of wounds with surrounding ecchymosis dermatitis were 
     significantly higher than those of wounds without ecchymosis 
     dermatitis (P < 0.05). The pH value of the wound with a sinus tract 
     was higher. After treatment, there was no significant difference in 
     pH value between the patients with and without sinus tracts (P < 
     0.05). Conclusions. The measurement of pH value is efficient and 
     simple, and the patient suffers no discomfort in the process. The 
     change in pH helps predict the healing process of diabetic foot 
     ulcers and quickly identify whether there are key factors such as 
     infection and ischemia in the wound. It is suggested that dynamic pH 
     monitoring be included in the whole course evaluation and 
     intervention strategy development of diabetic foot.]

     AB: Abstract. Objective. A systematic review was conducted to 
     evaluate the time delays in the management of diabetic foot and 
     explore influencing factors of these delays and potential outcomes. 
     Methods. The researchers searched several electronic databases 
     (Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMbase, CNKI, WanFang, CBM 
     and VIP) for English and Chinese studies that examined time delays in 
     the management pathway of diabetic foot. Two authors independently 
     screened and extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included 
     studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Agency for Health 
     Research and Quality checklist. Due to heterogeneity among the 
     studies, descriptive analysis was performed. Results. The review 
     included 28 articles, comprising 20 cohort studies and 8 
     cross-sectional studies, that met the inclusion criteria. Among 
     these, 14 were deemed of high quality. The median times from symptom 
     onset to primary health care or specialist care varied from 3 to 
     46.69 days. The median delay in referral by primary care specialists 
     ranged from 7 to 31 days, and subsequent median times to definitive 
     treatment ranged from 6.2 to 56 days. Multiple complex factors were 
     found to contribute to these delays, including patient demographics 
     (older age, lower education level and income level) and poor patient 
     health-seeking behaviors (inaccurate self-treatment, incorrect 
     recognition and interpretation of symptoms), inaccurate assessment or 
     initial treatment by health primary professionals, complex referral 
     pathways and clinical characteristics of diabetic foot (number of 
     foot ulcers, Wagner grade scale, and hemoglobin A1c index). Negative 
     outcomes associated with these delays included increased risk of 
     major amputation and mortality, decreased wound healing rate, 
     prolonged hospital stay, and increased hospital costs. Conclusions. 
     Time delays in the diabetic foot management pathway were both common 
     and serious, contributing to negative health outcomes for patients 
     with diabetic foot. Many complex factors related to patient's poor 
     patient health-seeking behaviors, health system, and clinical 
     characteristics of diabetic foot are responsible for these delays. 
     Therefore, it is necessary to develop new strategies for standard 
     referral practices and strengthen patient awareness of seeking care.]

     AB: Abstract. Frailty in older adults often leads to foot issues, 
     increasing fall-related fracture risk. Mechanoreceptors, the pressure 
     receptors in the foot sole, are pivotal for postural control. Foot 
     problems can impair mechanoreceptor function, compromising balance. 
     This study aimed to examine the effect of foot care on postural 
     control in frail older adults. Forty-eight participants underwent a 
     five-month monthly foot care intervention. Measurements were taken 
     before and after this intervention. Participants stood for 45 s in a 
     static, open-eyed position on a stabilometer. Center-of-pressure 
     (CoP) analysis included total trajectory length, integrated triangle 
     area, rectangular area, and range of motion in anterior-posterior and 
     medio-lateral directions. Results indicated that foot care 
     significantly increased toe ground contact area by 1.3 times and 
     improved anterior-posterior motion control during static standing. 
     Enhanced postural control resulted from improved skin condition due 
     to foot care that intensified mechanoreceptor signal input and 
     improved postural control output. These findings underscore the 
     potential for reducing fracture risks in older adults through 
     proactive foot care. The study highlights the vital role of foot care 
     in enhancing postural control, with broader implications for aging 
     population well-being and safety.]

     AB: Abstract. Exoskeletons and orthotic devices are commonly used in 
     physical rehabilitation. However, these devices, fitting intimately 
     with the human body, often lead to skin-related issues amongst users. 
     Misalignments between orthotic and anatomical joints cause relative 
     sliding motion between the limb and orthosis and also cause pressure 
     points on the limb, which may contribute to these skin problems. This 
     research quantifies the effects of sagittal plane ankle-joint 
     misalignments for an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) user during walking. A 
     2D mathematical model that simulates the effects of sagittal plane 
     ankle-joint misalignments in terms of relative motion between the 
     limb and the orthosis was developed using MATLAB software. The 
     orthotic ankle-joint was systematically misaligned against the 
     anatomical ankle-joint to generate various misalignment conditions. 
     Published gait data of 5 healthy subjects was used to generate 
     walking kinematics which was then superimposed with an articulated 
     AFO. The simulations showed that Anterior-Posterior misalignments 
     resulted in greater pistoning motion than Proximal-Distal 
     misalignments. Combined misalignments (Posterior-Distal, 
     Anterior-Proximal, Posterior-Proximal, and Anterior-Distal) resulted 
     in higher overall relative motions between the limb and AFO. The 
     model also predicted pressure points on the shank and foot caused by 
     misalignments. This study demonstrates that misaligned ankle-joints 
     in AFOs lead to relative sliding motion and pressure points during 
     walking.]

     AB: Abstract. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most 
     frequent childhood dystrophies, affecting cardiopulmonary functions 
     and walking ability. One of the main symptoms is fatigue, which is 
     caused by altered muscle metabolism related to energy expenditure 
     (EE). Aquatic physiotherapy is a therapeutic modality that 
     facilitates the maintenance of this posture because of immersion on 
     the body. This cross-sectional observational study aimed to compare 
     the EE on the ground and water of individuals with DMD through oxygen 
     consumption in the maintenance of sitting posture. The individuals 
     were in a sitting position on the ground and in the water for 20 min 
     for the assessments. The variables peripheral oxygen saturation, 
     heart rate, maximum expiratory pressure, maximum inspiratory 
     pressure, forced vital capacity, respiratory quotient (RQ), and 
     oxygen consumption per kilogram of body weight (VO2 /kg) were 
     compared, adopting a significance of 5 %. No difference was found 
     between medians and quartiles of RQ when comparing the two 
     environments. The same was observed for VO2 /Kg values on the ground 
     and in water. The data from this study demonstrate that the EE of 
     individuals with DMD did not change when maintaining a sitting 
     posture on the ground and in water.]

     AB: Summary. Exercise is universally recommended as a primary 
     strategy for the management of knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain. The 
     recommendations are based on results from more than 100 randomized 
     controlled trials (RCTs) that compare exercise to no-attention 
     control groups. However, due to the inherent difficulties with 
     adequate placebo control, participant blinding and the use of 
     patient-reported outcomes, the existing RCT evidence is imperfect. To 
     better understand the evidence used to support a causal relationship 
     between exercise and knee OA pain relief, we examined the existing 
     evidence through the Bradford Hill considerations for causation. The 
     Bradford Hill considerations, first proposed in 1965 by Sir Austin 
     Bradford Hill, provide a framework for assessment of possible causal 
     relationships. There are 9 considerations by which the evidence is 
     reviewed: Strength of association, Consistency, Specificity, 
     Temporality, Biological Gradient (Dose-Response), Plausibility, 
     Coherence, Experiment, and Analogy. Viewing the evidence from these 9 
     viewpoints did neither bring forward indisputable evidence for nor 
     against the causal relationship between exercise and improved knee OA 
     pain. Rather, we conclude that the current evidence is not sufficient 
     to support claims about (lack of) causality. With our review, we hope 
     to advance the continued global conversation about how to improve the 
     evidence-based management of patients with knee OA.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Anxiety is common in patients with chronic 
     obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, there is little 
     evidence available regarding gender differences, and severity of 
     dyspnea in relation to anxiety in patients with COPD. Aims. We 
     examined gender differences and the association of dyspnea with 
     anxiety in a cohort of patients with COPD prior to entering a 
     pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Method. We analyzed data from 
     a prospective cohort of COPD patients who attended PR from 2013 to 
     2019 in Lytham, Lancashire, UK. Patients were aged 40 years or older 
     with a post-bronchodilation forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 
     less than 80 % of the predicted normal value and FEV1/FVC (forced 
     vital capacity) ratio less than 0.7. We assessed quality of life 
     (QoL) using the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), 
     anxiety using the Anxiety Inventory for Respiratory disease (AIR), 
     dyspnea using the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale, and 
     exercise capacity using the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT). 
     Results. Nine hundred ninety-three patients with COPD (mean age = 71 
     years, FEV1/FVC = 58 % predicted, 51 % male) entered the PR program. 
     Of these, 348 (35 %) had anxiety symptoms (AIR ≥8); of these 165 
     (47 %) were male and 183 (53 %) female, (χ2 = 3.33, p = 0.06). On 
     logistic multivariate analysis, the following variables were 
     independently associated with elevated anxiety: younger age (p < 
     0.001), female sex (p = 0.03), higher SGRQ-total score (p < 0.001) 
     and high FEV1/FVC (p < 0.002). Dyspnea was associated with anxiety r 
     = 0.25, p < 0.001. Conclusion. Over a third of COPD patients had 
     clinically relevant anxiety symptoms with a higher prevalence in 
     women than men. Anxiety was associated with younger age, female 
     gender, and impaired QoL. Early recognition and treatment of anxiety 
     in patients with COPD is worthy of consideration for those attending 
     PR, especially women.]

     AB: Abstract. Objectives. To measure the association between SLE 
     remission and scores of patients-reported outcome (PRO) measures. 
     Methods. We performed a prospective cohort study of SLE patients with 
     a 2-year follow-up, using Lupus Patient-Reported Outcome (LupusPRO), 
     Lupus Quality of Life (LupusQoL), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
     Quality of Life (SLEQOL) and 36-item Short Form (SF-36) 
     questionnaires. Remission was defined as remission off treatment 
     (ROFT) and remission on treatment (RONT) according to the definitions 
     of remission in SLE consensus. Mixed models accounting for repeated 
     measures were used to compare groups as follow: ROFT and RONT vs no 
     remission and lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS) vs no LLDAS. 
     Results. A total of 1478 medical visits and 2547 PRO questionnaires 
     were collected during the follow-up from the 336 recruited patients. 
     A between-group difference in PRO scores reaching at least 5 points 
     on a 0-100 scale was obtained in the following domains: lupus 
     symptoms (LLDAS: +5 points on the 0-100 scale, RONT: +9, ROFT: +5), 
     lupus medication (LLDAS: +5, RONT: +8, ROFT: +9), pain vitality 
     (LLDAS: +6, RONT: +9, ROFT: +6) of LupusPRO; role emotional (LLDAS: 
     +5, RONT: +8), role physical (RONT: +7 and ROFT: +7), bodily pain 
     (RONT: +6), mental health (RONT: +5) and social functioning (RONT: 
     +6) of SF-36. In contrast, a between-group difference reaching at 
     least 5 points was not achieved for any of the LupusQoL and SLEQOL 
     domains. Conclusions. RONT, ROFT and LLDAS were associated with 
     significant and clinically relevant higher QoL in most PRO domains of 
     the LupusPRO (disease specific) and SF-36 (generic) questionnaires, 
     but not with LupusQoL and SLEQOL disease-specific questionnaires.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Stroke poses challenges to the 
     physiological, psychosocial and spiritual well-being of affected 
     individuals. As the impacts of stroke might not be reversible, a 
     shift in focus to providing care is desirable. Visual art 
     interventions using visual and symbolic art can help participants to 
     express their feelings, give them a sense of choice and the feeling 
     that they are retaining a sense of control, promote insights, 
     restructure their sense of cognition and instil hope. There have been 
     few studies on visual art interventions involving older people with 
     stroke and none in residential care homes (RCHs). Theoretical support 
     and rigorous research designs on the subject are lacking. Thus, this 
     study seeks to address this research gap by examining the feasibility 
     of a visual art intervention for older people in RCHs and exploring 
     the impacts on their holistic well-being. Methods. This was a 
     single-blinded, two-arm, randomised controlled feasibility study 
     grounded on Watson's Caring Theory. The Holistic Well-Being Scale and 
     Caring Factor Survey were used in the study, with three assessment 
     time-points: before the intervention (T1), at the mid-point of the 
     intervention (T2) and immediately after the intervention (T3). 
     Results. Sixty-one older people with stroke were recruited from 14 
     RCHs and randomised into the intervention and control groups. The 
     recruitment rate was 44.53%, and the retention rate for the 
     intervention group was 93.55%. Implementing the programme was 
     affordable (at approximately US$126/head), the duration was 
     acceptable (721 min) and the feedback from participants and staff of 
     the RCHs was positive. Conclusions. The visual art intervention 
     programme proved to be clinically feasible. This study adds new 
     insights to the development of visual art interventions and to the 
     caring sciences. The efficacy of the programme on holistic well-being 
     has yet to be confirmed.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. A key perspective in examining dignity, which is 
     important for older adults, is spirituality. Therefore, this study 
     aimed to identify the components of spirituality in older adults 
     through interviews based on dignity therapy (DT). Methodological 
     Design and Justification. Colaizzi's descriptive phenomenology was 
     applied to understand experiences rooted in the life world of older 
     adults from their own perspective. Ethical Issues and Approval. This 
     study was approved by the ethical review committee of the author's 
     university. All participants provided consent to participate. 
     Research Methods. Semi-structured interviews based on DT were 
     conducted with 11 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older 
     who were using some form of medical or social services. The 
     interviews were transcribed, and the text was analysed based on 
     Colaizzi's phenomenological method. Results. Four themes were 
     identified as components of spirituality in older adults: trauma, 
     being silent about hard experiences, forming connections and taking 
     on challenges and discovering one's own spirit. The participants felt 
     a sense of helplessness and frustration as they dealt with traumatic 
     events. Feelings of shame, guilt and/or resignation prevented them 
     from talking about the distress they were experiencing, but they were 
     able to move forward after receiving emotional support and having 
     opportunities to share with others. These processes led to the 
     discovery of a new self. Study Limitations. This study assessed the 
     experiences of older adults in Japan and may therefore have been 
     influenced by the social background and culture of Japan. Future 
     research should target older adults from a variety of social 
     backgrounds as well as those with specific health conditions. 
     Conclusion. The findings suggest the importance of creating 
     opportunities for healthcare professionals as well as family, friends 
     and community members to help older adults reflect on their lives and 
     talk about their accomplishments and unresolved issues. Doing so 
     should help older adults maintain their dignity while remaining aware 
     of their mortality.]

     Dignity Care Intervention (DCI-SWE) in municipal palliative care in 
     Sweden, focusing on implementation, context, and mechanism of impact. 
     Methods. This study had a process evaluation design. The Knowledge to 
     Action framework supported the implementation of the DCI-SWE. The 
     intervention was used by community nurses with older persons (n = 18) 
     in home healthcare and nursing homes. Data were collected by focus 
     groups- and individual interviews with community nurses (n = 11), 
     health care professionals (n = 5) and managers (n = 5), reflective 
     diaries, and field notes. Results. Grasping the DCI-SWE was 
     challenging for some community nurses. Enhanced communication 
     training and increased engagement from managers were requested. 
     However, the DCI-SWE was perceived to enhance professional pride in 
     nursing. In terms of fidelity, dose and reach the project was not 
     fully achieved. Regarding mechanism of impact the DCI-SWE contributes 
     to address older persons' loneliness and existential life issues, as 
     it put conversations with older persons on community nurses' agenda. 
     Conclusions. The DCI-SWE provided opportunities to maintain older 
     persons' dignity and quality of life. However, with refinements of 
     design and the DCI-SWE, the sustainability in the context may 
     increase.]

     complaints were reported in 3568 weekly OSTRC-O questionnaires. Mixed 
     complementary log-log regression models described the probability of 
     (i) experiencing symptoms if players were currently asymptomatic, 
     (ii) worsening symptoms if players had symptoms, and (iii) recovery 
     from knee complaints. Based on our causal assumptions, weekly jump 
     load was modeled as the independent variable, adjusted for age 
     (years), weight (kg), position on volleyball team, and past jump 
     load. No certain evidence of an association was found between weekly 
     jump load and probability of (i) knee complaints (p from 0.10 to 0.32 
     for three restricted cubic splines of load), (ii) worsening symptoms 
     if the player already had symptoms (p from 0.11 to 0.97), (iii) 
     recovery (p from 0.36 to 0.63). The probability of knee complaints 
     was highest for above-average weekly jump load (~1.2% for an outside 
     hitter with mean age and height) compared with low loads (~1%) and 
     very high loads (→ ~ 0%). The association between jump load and 
     knee complaints risk remains unclear. Small differences in risk 
     across observed jump load levels were observed. It would likely 
     require substantially increased sample sizes to detect this 
     association with certainty.]

     AB: Abstract. Purpose. Delayed structural and functional recovery 
     after a 20 km graded running race was analyzed with respect to the 
     sex effect. Methods. Thirteen female and 14 male recreational runners 
     completed the race and three test sessions: one before (PRE) and two 
     after, once on Day 1 or 2 (D1-2) and then on Day 3 or 4 (D3-4). 
     Muscle damage was assessed indirectly using ultrasonography to 
     quantify changes in cross-sectional area (CSA) of 10 lower-limb 
     muscles. Delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) was assessed for 
     three muscle groups. Functional recovery was quantified by kinetic 
     analysis of a squat jump (SJ) and a drop jump (DJ) test performed on 
     a sledge ergometer. Linear mixed models were used to assess control 
     group reproducibility and recovery patterns according to sex. 
     Results. Regardless of sex, DOMS peaked at D1-2 for all muscle groups 
     and resolved at D3-4. CSA was increased in each muscle group until 
     D3-4, especially in the semimembranosus muscle. A specific increase 
     was found in the short head of the biceps femoris in women. 
     Regardless of sex, SJ and DJ performances declined up to D3-4. 
     Depending on the muscle, positive and/or negative correlations were 
     found between structural and functional changes. Some of these were 
     sex-specific. Conclusion. Structural and functional recovery was 
     incomplete in both sexes up to D3-4, although DOMS had disappeared. 
     More emphasis should be placed on hamstring muscle recovery. 
     Highlighting the intermuscular compensations that can occur during 
     multi-joint testing tasks, the structural-functional relationships 
     were either positive or negative, muscle- and sex-dependent.]

     AB: Abstract. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) measures are useful in 
     assessing musculoskeletal tissues, but application to tendon has been 
     limited. The purposes of this study were to optimize, identify 
     sources of variability, and establish reproducibility of qMRI to 
     assess Achilles tendon. Additionally, preliminarily estimates of 
     effect of tendon pathology on qMRI metrics and structure-function 
     relationships between qMRI measures and ankle performance were 
     examined. T1, T1ρ, T2, and T2* maps of the Achilles tendon were 
     obtained using a 3T MRI scanner. In participants with asymptomatic 
     tendons (n = 21), MRI procedures were repeated twice, and region of 
     interest selection was performed by three raters. Variance 
     decomposition and reproducibility statistics were completed. To 
     estimate the effect of pathology, qMRI measures from individuals with 
     asymptomatic tendons were compared to qMRI measures from a pilot 
     group of individuals with Achilles tendinopathy (n = 7). 
     Relationships between qMRI and ankle performance measures were 
     assessed. Between-participant variation accounted for the majority of 
     variability (46.7%-64.0%) in all qMRI measures except T2*. ICCs met 
     or exceeded 0.7 for all qMRI measures when averaged across raters or 
     scans. Relaxation times were significantly longer in tendinopathic 
     tendons (mean (SD) T1: 977.8 (208.6) ms, T1ρ: 35.4 (7.1) ms, T2: 
     42.8 (7.9) ms, T2*: 14.1 (7.6) ms, n = 7) compared to asymptomatic 
     control tendons (T1: 691.7 (32.4) ms, T1ρ: 24.0 (3.6) ms, T2: 24.4 
     (7.5) ms, T2*: 9.5 (3.4) ms, n = 21) (p < 0.011 for all comparisons). 
     T1 related to functional performance measures in symptomatic and 
     asymptomatic groups. Study findings suggest that qMRI is reliable to 
     assess the Achilles tendon. qMRI quantitatively assesses the presence 
     of tendon pathology and relates to functional performance outcomes, 
     supporting the utility of incorporating qMRI in research and clinic.]

     AB: Summary. Objectives. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are used as 
     therapeutic and rehabilitation programs after myocardial infarction 
     and angioplasty in order to reduce cardiovascular disease mortality 
     since different training methods and gender differences have unique 
     effects on the structural and functional responses of the 
     cardiovascular system. Equipment and methods. Sixty men and women 
     with coronary artery disease who underwent angioplasty were randomly 
     divided into two groups of experiment (concurrent training and 
     control group) in this prospective and semi-laboratory research with 
     a pre- and post-test design. Forty minutes of aerobic training based 
     on ACSM instructions (three sessions a week for eight weeks) and then 
     twenty minutes of resistance training (two sessions a week) were 
     performed in the training group in order to rehabilitate the 
     patients. Results. No significant difference was observed between the 
     two genders in the effectiveness of concurrent training on the 
     selected variables of blood and vascular biomechanics in the left 
     femoral artery (especially on the resting lumen diameter in the 
     systolic [P = 0.22] and diastolic phases [P = 0.43]). A global effect 
     of concurrent training was observed, resulting in an increase in the 
     resting lumen diameter in the systolic and diastolic phases (P < 
     0.001). No interaction effect was reported on artery compliance (P = 
     0.69), blood flow intensity (P = 0.85), and intima-media thickness to 
     resting lumen diameter ratio (P = 0.56) and the decrease in the 
     variables of blood flow velocity (P = 0.93, P = 0.73) and blood 
     pressure (P = 0.78, P = 0.81) in the systolic and diastolic phases of 
     the left femoral artery. Conclusions. Using the beneficial effects of 
     concurrent training with appropriate intensity and duration is 
     recommended in middle-aged (40-65 years old) male and female patients 
     after coronary artery angioplasty in order to improve the variables 
     of blood and vascular biomechanics.]

     AB: Abstract. Introduction. Fall prevention is a global health 
     priority. Strength and balance exercise programmes are effective at 
     reducing falls. Emerging literature suggests dance is an enjoyable 
     and sociable form of exercise. However, there is little evidence that 
     dance reduces fall incidence. Methods, Systematic review and 
     meta-analysis examining effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dance 
     for falls prevention in older adults. Five databases were searched 
     with no restrictions on publication date or intervention settings. 
     Risk of bias was assessed using variants of Cochrane Risk of bias 
     tools, Mixed-. Methods: Appraisal and Drummond checklist as 
     appropriate. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Results. 
     Forty-one studies were included (19 RCTs, 13 quasi-experimental, two 
     mixed-method, seven observational studies, 2,451 participants). Five 
     types of dance interventions were identified: ballroom and Latin 
     dance, dance exercise, cultural dance, dance therapy, and low-impact 
     dance. Meta-analysis was only possible for functional outcome 
     measures: Timed-Up-and-Go (dance versus usual care, mean difference 
     (MD) = 1.36; 95% CI −3.57 to 0.85), Sit-to-Stand (dance versus 
     exercise MD = −0.85; 95% CI −2.64 to 0.93: dance versus education 
     MD = −1.64; 95% CI −4.12 to 0.85), Berg Balance Scale (dance 
     versus usual care MD = 0.61; 95% CI −4.26 to 5.47). There was 
     unexplained variance in effects and no significant differences 
     between intervention and control groups. Overall, certainty of 
     evidence was very low; we are uncertain about the effect of dance 
     interventions in reducing falls. Conclusions. There is very low 
     certainty evidence for dance as an alternative to strength and 
     balance training if the aim is to prevent falls. No robust evidence 
     on the cost-effectiveness of dance interventions for the prevention 
     of falls was found.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Patients with congestive heart failure 
     (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dementia are 
     underrepresented in specialist palliative home care (SPHC). However, 
     the complexity of their conditions requires collaboration between 
     general practitioners (GPs) and SPHC teams and timely integration 
     into SPHC to effectively meet their needs. Objective. To facilitate 
     joint palliative care planning and the timely transfer of patients 
     with advanced chronic non-malignant conditions to SPHC. Methods. A 
     two-arm, unblinded, cluster-randomised controlled trial. 49 GP 
     practices in northern Germany were randomised using web-based block 
     randomisation. We included patients with advanced CHF, COPD and/or 
     dementia. The KOPAL intervention consisted of a SPHC nurse-patient 
     consultation followed by an interprofessional telephone case 
     conference between SPHC team and GP. The primary outcome was the 
     number of hospital admissions 48 weeks after baseline. Secondary 
     analyses examined the effects on health-related quality of life and 
     self-rated health status, as measured by the EuroQol 5D scale. 
     Results. A total of 172 patients were included in the analyses. 80.4% 
     of GP practices had worked with SHPC before, most of them exclusively 
     for cancer patients. At baseline, patients reported a mean EQ-VAS of 
     48.4, a mean quality of life index (EQ-5D-5L) of 0.63 and an average 
     of 0.80 hospital admissions in the previous year. The intervention 
     did not significantly reduce hospital admissions (incidence rate 
     ratio = 0.79, 95%CI: [0.49, 1.26], P = 0.31) or the number of days 
     spent in hospital (incidence rate ratio = 0.65, 95%CI: [0.28, 1.49], 
     P = 0.29). There was also no significant effect on quality of life 
     (∆ = −0.02, 95%CI: [−0.09, 0.05], P = 0.53) or self-rated 
     health (∆ = −2.48, 95%CI: [−9.95, 4.99], P = 0.51). 
     Conclusions. The study did not show the hypothesised effect on 
     hospitalisations and health-related quality of life. Future research 
     should focus on refining this approach, with particular emphasis on 
     optimising the timing of case conferences and implementing discussed 
     changes to treatment plans, to improve collaboration between GPs and 
     SPHC teams.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. The updated European Working Group on 
     Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) recommends handgrip strength 
     (HGS) and the chair stand test (CST) to assess muscle strength, with 
     the CST being a convenient proxy for lower limb strength. However, 
     adiposity may differentially influence these strength criteria and 
     produce discrepant sarcopenia prevalence. Objective. To determine the 
     prevalence of sarcopenia using HGS or the CST, and to investigate the 
     associations between these strength criteria and adiposity in adults 
     with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods. The EWGSOP2 definition was 
     used to assess the prevalence of probable (low muscle strength), 
     confirmed (plus low muscle mass) and severe (plus poor physical 
     performance) sarcopenia. Linear regression models were used to study 
     the association between different measures of muscle strength and 
     adiposity. Results. We used data from 732 adults with type 2 diabetes 
     mellitus (35.7% female, aged 64 ± 8 years, body mass index 30.7 ± 
     5.0 kg/m2). Using the CST compared with HGS produced a higher 
     prevalence of probable (31.7% vs. 7.1%), confirmed (5.6% vs. 1.6%) 
     and severe (1.0% vs. 0.3%) sarcopenia, with poor agreement between 
     strength criteria to identify probable sarcopenia. CST performance, 
     but not HGS, was significantly associated with all measures of 
     adiposity in unadjusted and adjusted models. Conclusions. Higher 
     levels of adiposity may impact CST performance, but not HGS, 
     resulting in a higher prevalence of sarcopenia in adults with type 2 
     diabetes mellitus. Consideration should be paid to the most 
     appropriate measure of muscle function in this population.]

     GR facilities in 10 European countries. Participants. Post-COVID-19 
     patients admitted to GR between October 2020 and October 2021. 
     Methods. Patients' characteristics, daily functioning (Barthel index; 
     BI), quality of life (QoL; EQ-5D-5L) and frailty (Clinical Frailty 
     Scale; CFS) were collected at admission, discharge, 6 weeks and 6 
     months after discharge. We used linear mixed models to examine the 
     trajectories of daily functioning and QoL. Results. 723 participants 
     were included with a mean age of 75 (SD: 9.91) years. Most 
     participants were pre-frail to frail (median [interquartile range] 
     CFS 6.0 [5.0-7.0]) at admission. After admission, the BI first 
     steeply increased from 11.31 with 2.51 (SE 0.15, P < 0.001) points 
     per month and stabilised around 17.0 (quadratic slope: −0.26, SE 
     0.02, P < 0.001). Similarly, EQ-5D-5L first steeply increased from 
     0.569 with 0.126 points per month (SE 0.008, P < 0.001) and 
     stabilised around 0.8 (quadratic slope: −0.014, SE 0.001, P < 
     0.001). Functional recovery rates were independent of frailty level 
     at admission. QoL was lower at admission for frailer participants, 
     but increased faster, stabilising at almost equal QoL values for 
     frail, pre-frail and fit patients. Conclusions. Post-COVID-19 
     patients admitted to GR showed substantial recovery in daily 
     functioning and QoL. Frailty at GR admission was not associated with 
     recovery and should not be a reason to exclude patients from GR.]

     risk. However, the role of plant-based diets, particularly their 
     quality, is poorly known. Objective. To examine the association of 
     two plant-based diets with incidence of physical frailty in 
     middle-aged and older adults. Design. Prospective cohort. Setting. 
     United Kingdom Subjects. 24,996 individuals aged 40-70 years, 
     followed from 2009-12 to 2019-22. Methods. Based on at least two 24-h 
     diet assessments, we built two diet indices: (i) the healthful 
     Plant-based Diet Index (hPDI) and (ii) the unhealthful Plant-based 
     Diet Index (uPDI). Incident frailty was defined as developing ≥3 
     out of 5 of the Fried criteria. We used Cox models to estimate 
     relative risks (RR), and their 95% confidence interval (CI), of 
     incident frailty adjusted for the main potential confounders. 
     Results. After a median follow-up of 6.72 years, 428 cases of frailty 
     were ascertained. The RR (95% CI) of frailty was 0.62 (0.48-0.80) for 
     the highest versus lowest tertile of the hPDI and 1.61 (1.26-2.05) 
     for the uPDI. The consumption of healthy plant foods was associated 
     with lower frailty risk (RR per serving 0.93 (0.90-0.96)). The hPDI 
     was directly, and the uPDI inversely, associated with higher risk of 
     low physical activity, slow walking speed and weak hand grip, and the 
     uPDI with higher risk of exhaustion. Conclusions. In British 
     middle-age and older adults, greater adherence to the hPDI was 
     associated with lower risk of frailty, whereas greater adherence to 
     the uPDI was associated with higher risk.]

     important role to play in identification of frailty and delivery of 
     interventions to optimise medicines use for frail older adults. 
     However, little is known about their knowledge or views about this 
     role. Aim. To explore community pharmacists' knowledge of frailty and 
     assessment, experiences and contact with frail older adults, and 
     perceptions of their role in optimising medicines use for this 
     population. Methods. Semi-structured interviews conducted between 
     March and December 2020 with 15 community pharmacists in Northern 
     Ireland. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed 
     thematically. Results. Three broad themes were generated from the 
     data. The first, 'awareness and understanding of frailty', 
     highlighted gaps in community pharmacists' knowledge regarding 
     presentation and identification of frailty and their reluctance to 
     broach potentially challenging conversations with frail older 
     patients. Within the second theme, 'problem-solving and supporting 
     medication use', community pharmacists felt a large part of their 
     role was to resolve medicines-related issues for frail older adults 
     through collaboration with other primary healthcare professionals but 
     feedback on the outcome was often not provided upon issue resolution. 
     The third theme, 'seizing opportunities in primary care to enhance

     AB: Abstract. There is evidence that existing standards for signal 
     timing do not provide enough time for many pedestrians to safely 
     cross intersections. Yet, current methods for studying this problem 
     rely on inefficient manual observations. The objective of this work 
     was to determine if the YOLOv4 and Deep SORT computer vision 
     algorithms have the potential to be incorporated into automated 
     measurement systems to measure and compare pedestrian walking speeds 
     at one-stage and two-stage street crossings captured in 
     birds-eye-view video. Walking speed was estimated for 1018 
     pedestrians at single-stage (591 pedestrians) and two-stage (427 
     pedestrians) street crossings. Pedestrians in the one-stage crossing 
     were found to be significantly slower than pedestrians who crossed 
     the two-stage crossing in one signal (1.19 ± 0.50 vs. 1.31 ± 0.49 
     m/s, p < 0.001). This proof of principle study demonstrated that the 
     YOLOv4 and Deep SORT approaches are promising for estimating 
     pedestrian walking speed.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. To study if functional electrical stimulation 
     (FES) of the peroneal nerve, which activates dorsiflexion, can 
     improve body functions, activities, and participation and could be an 
     effective alternative treatment in individuals with unilateral 
     spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Method. A randomized cross-over trial 
     was performed in 25 children with unilateral spastic CP (classified 
     in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I and II) aged 4 
     to 18 years (median age at inclusion 9 years 8 months, interquartile 
     range = 7 years-13 years 8 months), 15 patients were male. The study 
     consisted of two 12-week blocks of treatment, that is, conventional 
     treatment (ankle foot orthosis [AFO] or adapted shoes) and FES, 
     separated by a 6-week washout period. Outcome measures included the 
     Goal Attainment Scale (GAS), the Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life 
     questionnaire, and a three-dimensional gait analysis. Results. 
     Eighteen patients completed the trial. The proportion of GAS goals 
     achieved was not significantly higher in the FES versus the 
     conventional treatment phase (goal 1 p = 0.065; goal 2 p = 1.00). 
     When walking while stimulated with FES, ankle dorsiflexion during 
     mid-swing decreased over time (p = 0.006, average decrease of 4.8° 
     with FES), with a preserved increased ankle range of motion compared 
     to conventional treatment (p < 0.001, mean range of motion with FES 
     +10.1° compared to AFO). No changes were found in the standard 
     physical examination or regarding satisfaction with orthoses and 
     feelings about the ability to dress yourself. In four patients, FES 
     therapy failed; in 12 patients FES therapy continued after the trial. 
     Interpretation. FES is not significantly worse than AFO; however, 
     patient selection is critical, and a testing period and thorough 
     follow-up are needed.]

     intervention, Sports Stars Brazil. Method. Parents of children with 
     CP (n = 15, 6-12 years old, nine males, six females), classified in 
     Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I and II, who 
     participated in the Sports Stars Brazil intervention, were recruited 
     for this descriptive qualitative study. Children received the 8-week 
     (1 hour per week) modified sports intervention. After the 
     intervention, parents participated in a focus group. The F-word 
     (fitness, family, fun, functioning, friends, and future) 
     interpretation of the International Classification of Functioning, 
     Disability and Health was used to guide the discussion. Participants 
     were invited to report their experience of participating in the 
     intervention using the F-words for a childhood disability model. 
     Transcripts were coded using content analysis. Results. Parents 
     reported positive experiences of the Sports Stars Brazil 
     intervention, including a decrease in sedentarism (fitness), 
     improvement of motor skills (functioning), greater connection between 
     child and family (family), better socialization (friends), increased 
     participation in pleasurable activities (fun), and awareness of the 
     importance of physical activity (future). All positive experiences 
     were interconnected. Interpretation. This study presents the ability 
     of the Sports Stars Brazil intervention to integrate all aspects of 
     functioning and supports its role as an engaging and promising 
     intervention option for ambulant children with CP.]

     AB: Abstract. Aim. To identify and analyse ways in which parents are 
     supported to deliver rehabilitation exercises to their child after 
     traumatic brain injury (TBI), conceptualized as strategies. Method. A 
     systematic search was completed using seven online databases and 
     three grey literature databases, from inception to November 2021. The 
     included studies focused on physical rehabilitation in children after 
     TBI with the involvement of parents as hands-on deliverers or 
     facilitators of rehabilitation (e.g. supervising the exercise). 
     Intervention descriptions were reviewed to identify strategies; this 
     was followed by fine-grained analysis using the Behaviour Change 
     Wheel to identify intervention components. Risk of bias was analysed 
     using the revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials or 
     the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions. 
     Results. Six interventions including 211 participants and one trial 
     protocol met the inclusion criteria. All studies included a 
     proportion of children diagnosed with TBI and four studies included 
     mixed samples of acquired brain injury or cerebral palsy. All 
     interventions included elements of goal setting and instruction. 
     Interpretation. Interventions focus heavily on the initiation of 
     physical rehabilitation, but focus less on the longer-term 
     maintenance of rehabilitation delivery. Further research should 
     integrate perspectives from parents to inform the development of new 
     interventions.]

     covered self-expandable metal stent (FCSEMS) was designed to reduce 
     stent migration, which is seen in up to 30% of patients. The goal of 
     this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 
     multisegmented FCSEMS. Methods. This multicenter prospective study 
     aimed to include 30 patients undergoing palliative stent placement. 
     Efficacy, defined as technically successful stent placement and 
     dysphagia scores, and safety, defined as the number of adverse events 
     (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), were measured. Results. The study was 
     prematurely terminated due to safety concerns after including 23 
     patients (mean ± standard deviation age, 72 ± 10 years; 78% male). 
     Stent placement was technically successful in 21 patients (91%), and 
     dysphagia scores had improved in all patients with successful stent 
     placement. SAEs were reported in 16 (70%) patients. Stent-related 
     mortality occurred in 3 patients (13%). Conclusions. The 
     multisegmented FCSEMS successfully treated malignant dysphagia. The 
     study was prematurely terminated, however, because stent placement 
     was associated with a relatively high SAE rate.]

     caregivers of older people from different regions of Brazil 
     participated in an empathy training program. The caregivers answered 
     a sociodemographic questionnaire and measures for the evaluation of 
     empathy (affective and cognitive domains), burden, the impact of 
     providing care as well as depressive symptoms and psychiatric 
     symptoms before and immediately after training. Empathy and its 
     domains were also assessed at three post-intervention follow-ups. 
     Results. Empathy training diminished levels of psychological 
     concerns. Moreover, an increase was found in levels of cognitive 
     empathy 15, 30 and 60 days after the intervention. Conclusions. 
     Empathy training with a focus on cognitive empathy diminished

     and anxiety at baseline and post-intervention were assessed using the 
     Self-care Ability Scale for the Elderly (SASE), Self-Rating 
     Depression Scale (SDS), and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), 
     respectively. The t-test, Mann-Whitney U, and chi-square tests were 
     conducted for group comparisons. After 6 months of intervention, the 
     intervention group had significantly higher self-concept, 
     self-skills, self-care awareness, and health knowledge scores than 
     the baseline and the control group (all P-values < 0.05). The 
     intervention group had significantly lower depression and anxiety 
     scores than the baseline and the control group (all P-values < 0.05). 
     SFBT is effective in improving older adults' self-care and mental

     among older nursing home residents. Methods. A systematic review and 
     meta-analysis were conducted. The PubMed, Ovid, Embase, Cochrane, 
     CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant 
     studies from inception until June 1, 2023. The reviewers 
     independently completed the study selection, data extraction and 
     quality assessment. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the 
     sources of between-study heterogeneity and to determine whether 
     participant or intervention characteristics influenced effect sizes. 
     Results. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were 
     selected for qualitative and quantitative synthesis. The overall 
     methodological quality was relatively high, and the overall evidence 
     grade was moderate. VR exergames had a large effect on physical 
     function, including mobility [SMD=-0.66, P < 0.001], balance 
     [SMD=0.95, P < 0.001], and lower limb strength [SMD=0.53, P = 
     0.0009]; and a moderate effect on cognition [SMD=0.48, P = 0.02] and 
     depression [SMD=-0.72, P = 0.03]. Subgroup analyses revealed that a 
     training frequency of 2 sessions per week and coordinating with 
     physiotherapists yielded greater improvements in mobility (P = 0.009; 
     P = 0.0001). VR exergames had especially beneficial effects on 
     balance for physically fit participants (P = 0.03) and on cognition 
     for participants with cognitive impairment (P = 0.01). Additionally, 
     regarding the improvement of depression, commercial VR exergames were 
     superior to self-made systems (P = 0.03). Conclusion. VR exergames 
     can provide a positive impact on physical function, cognition and 
     depression among older nursing home residents. The study also 
     demonstrated the different benefits of exergames between participants 
     who were physically fit and those with cognitive impairment, which is 
     considered as an innovative, cost-efficient and sustainable approach. 
     Specifically, commercial VR exergame programs with a frequency of 2 
     sessions per week and coordinating with physiotherapists may be the 
     most appropriate and effective option.]

     sampling of 316 nursing home residents. Generalized structural

     results showed that residents with fear of falling were more likely 
     to restrict their activities and residents who often or always

     AB: Abstract. Background. Long-term rehabilitation of stroke 
     survivors is often difficult and new tools to improve quality of life 
     should be proposed. Community nursing can be a cost-effective tool to 
     positively impact the lives of stroke survivors. This meta-analysis 
     aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of community nursing on 
     rehabilitation for stroke survivors. Methods. The Cochrane Library, 
     PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, Embase, PEDro, China Knowledge 
     Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), WANFANG, and WEIPU databases 
     were comprehensively searched from their inception to April 18, 2023. 
     The revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs(RoB 2 tool) was used 
     to assess the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was 
     conducted using the Stata 12.0 software package and Review Manager 
     v5.3 software. Results. A total of 25 randomized controlled trials 
     with 2537 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Compared 
     with the control group, community nursing combined with routine 
     nursing had a significantly superior effect on the Barthel Index(BI), 
     Fugl-Meyer(FMA), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS), 
     Self-rating Anxiety Scale(SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale(SDS) 
     scores for stroke survivors (BI: MD: 18.48, 95 % CI [16.87, 20.08], P 
     < 0.00001; FMA: MD: 12.61, 95 % CI [10.44, 14.78], P < 0.00001; 
     NIHSS: MD: -2.94, 95 % CI [-3.50, -2.37], P < 0.00001; SAS: MD: 
     -8.19; 95 % CI: [-9.46, -6.92], P < 0.00001; SDS: MD: -6.46 95 % CI 
     [-7.23, -5.70], P < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that 
     routine nursing, health education, exercise rehabilitation nursing 
     and psychological nursing combined with different community nursing 
     measures were significant in rehabilitation for stroke survivors and 
     there was no heterogeneous in the studies of each subgroup(P > 0.1, 
     I2 < 50 %). Conclusion. This meta-analysis demonstrated that 
     community nursing combined with routine nursing might improve 
     activities of daily living, motor function and nerve function, and 
     relieve anxiety and depression in stroke survivors. Overall, 
     community nursing had a significant effect on rehabilitation of 
     stroke survivors. However, this study still has limitations such as 
     the overestimation effects caused by the sample size and the risk of 
     bias caused by interventions. Future research will attempt to 
     overcome these limitations and comprehensively assess the effect of 
     community nursing on the rehabilitation of stroke survivors.]

     older adults with MCI. The SPPB was assessed with the first 2 
     assessments separated by a 20-min interval and the third separated by 
     a 1-week interval. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 
     MDC values were estimated. Results. The intraday ICC was 0.73 for the 
     SPPB score, 0.90 for the 4-m walk time (4mwt), and 0.95 for the 
     5-times chair stand time (5cst); the corresponding interday ICC 
     values were 0.76, 0.89, and 0.91, respectively. The MDC values ranged

     AB: Abstract. Background. Chronic pain diminishes the quality of life 
     for many Older Adults individuals. Identifying effective coping 
     methods to enhance pain resilience is imperative as populations age. 
     Older Adults commonly use religious faith and spiritual practices to 
     endure pain, yet little research has explored their impact on pain 
     tolerance. Methods. This cross-sectional study examined relationships 
     between positive/negative religious coping styles and pain endurance 
     in 200 Arab elders with chronic pain. Participants completed the 
     Brief Arab Religious Coping Scale, Numeric Pain Rating Scale, 
     WHOQOL-BREF, and demographic/medical history questionnaires. Results. 
     Quantitative analysis demonstrated significant positive associations 
     between positive religious reappraisal and active spiritual coping 
     with higher self-reported pain endurance (p<.05). Negative religious 
     coping styles lacked meaningful relationships with pain tolerance. 
     Multiple regression confirmed the unique effects of reappraisal and 
     spiritual practice on improving pain resilience, controlling for 
     covariates. Conclusions. Outcomes align with perspectives 
     highlighting multidimensional neurocognitive, emotional, and 
     psychosocial pain relief from religious coping. Findings underscore 
     integrating positive faith-based resources in biopsychosocial 
     paradigms for Older Adult's pain management. Additional research 
     should investigate causal pathways and contextual factors influencing 
     religious coping effects on diverse Older Adult subgroups.]

     AB: Abstract. There remains a paucity of evidence on the early 
     predictors of long-term Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 
     outcomes post-burn in hospitalised adults. The overall aim of this 
     study was to identify the factors (personal, environmental, burn 
     injury and burn treatment factors) that may predict long-term HRQoL 
     outcomes among adult survivors of hospitalised burn injuries at 12 
     months post-burn. A total of 274 participants, aged 18 years or over, 
     admitted to a single state-wide burn centre with a burn injury were 
     recruited. Injury and burn treatment information were collected from 
     medical records or the hospital database and surveys collected 
     demographic and social data. HRQoL outcome data were collected at 3-, 
     6- and 12-months using the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12 v1) and 
     Burns Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B). Personal, environmental, 
     burn injury and burn treatment factors were also recorded at 
     baseline. Analyses were performed using linear and logistic 
     regression. Among 274 participants, 71.5 % (N=196) remained enrolled 
     in the study at 12 months post-burn. The majority of participants 
     reported HRQoL outcomes comparable with population norms and 
     statistically significant improvements in generic (SF-12 v1) and 
     condition-specific (BSHS-B) outcomes over time. However, for 
     participants with poor HRQoL outcomes at 12-months post-burn, 
     Univariable predictors included longer hospital length of stay, 
     unemployment at the time of injury, a diagnosed pre-injury mental 
     health condition, inadequate pre-burn social support, intentional 
     injury, recreational drug use pre-injury and female gender. The early 
     multivariable predictors of insufficient HRQoL outcomes were female 
     gender, a previously diagnosed mental health condition, unemployment, 
     inadequate social support, intentional injury, and prolonged hospital 
     length of stay. These results suggest potential factors that could be 
     used to screen and burns patients for psychosocial intervention and 
     long-term follow up.]

     AB: Abstract. The role of scapular dyskinesis as a risk factor of 
     shoulder injury has been largely discussed. However, most studies 
     have focused on symptomatic patients and less is known on the 
     asymptomatic dyskinetic scapula. Removing the confounding effects of 
     the pathologies could contribute to better characterize the scapula 
     dyskinesis. As muscle properties (strength, fatigue, nerve injury 
     …) have been identified as causative factors of scapular 
     dyskinesis, this study focuses specifically on characterizing the 
     protractor and retractor muscles of the dyskinetic scapula. Thirteen 
     asymptomatic dyskinetic volunteers were compared to eleven 
     asymptomatic non-dyskinetic control volunteers. Muscle 
     characteristics were evaluated in terms of maximal strength, fatigue 
     resistance and electromyographic activity during a functional 
     closed-chained task. The results did not identify kinematic or muscle 
     activity significant differences between the dyskinetic and the 
     control group even in fatigue conditions. However, the results 
     demonstrated that protractors vs. retractors fatigue resistance 
     ratios were imbalanced (<0.8) in the dyskinetic group and 
     significantly lower than in the non-dyskinetic one. Our study 
     suggests that that strength imbalances are not necessarily related to 
     the presence of pain at the shoulder joint. These results 
     demonstrated the importance to complete the clinical assessments of 
     the scapula with strength evaluations even for asymptomatic sport 
     practitioners.]

     AB: Abstract. A prior study reported that the concentric strength 
     imbalance between hamstrings and quadriceps is associated with falls 
     in older adults. Given that the concentric strength may not be 
     measured as conveniently as the isometric strength, it is meaningful 
     to test whether the isometric hamstring-quadricep strength imbalance 
     is related to falls among older adults. This study sought to explore 
     whether the hamstrings-quadriceps ratio could differentiate fallers 
     from non-fallers in community-dwelling older adults. One hundred and 
     eleven older adults were included in this cross-sectional study. 
     Their isometric knee joint strength capacity (extensors and flexors) 
     was measured. Based on their fall history in the past year, they were 
     classified as fallers (at least one fall) or non-fallers (no fall). 
     The hamstrings-quadriceps ratio was compared between the faller and 
     non-faller groups. The receiver operating characteristic analysis was 
     used to determine the cutoff value of the hamstrings-quadriceps ratio 
     able to best classify fallers and non-fallers. Fallers showed a 
     significantly lower hamstrings-quadriceps ratio than non-fallers (p = 
     0.008). The receiver operating characteristic analysis identified 
     0.733 as the best ratio to differentiate fallers from non-fallers 
     with an accuracy of 64.0 %. A 0.1-unit reduction in the 
     hamstrings-quadriceps ratio increases the probability of falling by a 
     factor of 1.30. The hamstrings-quadriceps ratio could be used as an 
     additional fall risk factor when assessing the risk of falls among 
     older adults. A smaller than 0.733 hamstring-quadriceps ratio may 
     indicate a high risk of falls.]

     AB: Abstract. Premature osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate 
     ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is common among athletes. Reduced knee 
     contact forces after ACLR likely contribute to the multifactorial 
     etiology of the disease. Whether this reduction is accompanied by 
     compensatory increases in joint contact forces (JCF) at adjacent or 
     contralateral joints is unclear. It is also unclear if compensatory 
     effects depend on the task demands. Thus, we compared hip, knee, and 
     ankle JCF symmetry between individuals with reconstruction and a 
     matched control group during walking and running. Thirty participants 
     (19 females), 2-7 years post-unilateral ACLR (mean = 47.8 months), 
     and 30 controls matched on sex, mass, and activity level were 
     recruited. Limb symmetry indices of peak contact forces and force 
     impulses were calculated for each joint during walking and running, 
     and analyzed using two-factor (group, activity) analysis of 
     variances. Lower ACLR group peak knee JCF (p = 0.009) and knee JCF 
     impulse (p = 0.034) during walking and running were observed. An 
     interaction of group and activity was observed for peak hip JCF, with 
     ACLR participants demonstrating greater involved limb peak hip JCF 
     during running (p = 0.012). Ankle JCF and ground reaction force 
     symmetry indices were not different between groups or across tasks. 
     Decreased knee and increased ipsilateral peak hip JCF during running 
     suggests that proximal adaptations exist at 2-7 years after ACLR, 
     particularly during activities with increased task demand. Clinical 
     significance: Knee and hip JCF asymmetry at 2-7 years after ACLR may 
     underscore a need for clinical strategies and follow-up assessments 
     to identify and target such outcomes.]

     AB: Abstract. Chronic nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP) is a 
     prevalent condition with socioeconomic and healthcare challenges. The 
     flexion-relaxation phenomenon (FRP) evaluation is a valid clinical 
     tool for low back pain (LBP) assessment. Yoga, a holistic mind-body 
     practice, has been explored as an LBP intervention. This study aimed 
     to evaluate the impact of yoga asanas on the FRP in women with NSLBP. 
     The study included healthy and chronic NSLBP females who underwent an 
     eight-session yoga asanas program, with the first session conducted 
     in-clinic and the rest delivered with tele-approach. Outcome measures 
     included pain intensity, flexion-relaxation ratio (FRR), and trough 
     surface electromyography collected during trunk maximum voluntary 
     flexion (MVF). The study included 11 healthy and 10 NSLBP women. 
     Repeated measures test in chronic NSLBP group showed a significant 
     decrease in pain intensity after the 4 weeks follow-up (visual analog 
     scale [VAS]: 6.80 ± 1.48 vs. 3.30 ± 1.25; p < 0.001) and an FRR 
     improvement after the intervention (5.12 ± 0.93 vs. 9.49 ± 0.92; p 
     < 0.001). VAS and FRR effect sizes were 0.77 and 0.47, respectively. 
     Therefore, we performed a Prophet evaluation to assess FRR trends, 
     finding a growth rate (k) of 0.405 ± 0.448, with a forecast 1 month 
     after the end of the intervention approaching the trend line of the 
     control group. The findings suggested that tele-yoga asana might have 
     a positive impact on pain intensity and the FRP in chronic LBP. 
     Further research is warranted to confirm the long-term effects of 
     yoga for managing LBP.]

     AB: Abstract. Elderly patients often have more than one disease that 
     affects walking behavior. An objective tool to identify which disease 
     is the main cause of functional limitations may aid clinical decision 
     making. Therefore, we investigated whether gait patterns could be 
     used to identify degenerative diseases using machine learning. Data 
     were extracted from a clinical database that included sagittal joint 
     angles and spatiotemporal parameters measured using seven inertial 
     sensors, and anthropometric data of patients with unilateral knee or 
     hip osteoarthritis, lumbar or cervical spinal stenosis, and healthy 
     controls. Various classification models were explored using the 
     MATLAB Classification Learner app, and the optimizable Support Vector 
     Machine was chosen as the best performing model. The accuracy of 
     discrimination between healthy and pathologic gait was 82.3%, 
     indicating that it is possible to distinguish pathological from 
     healthy gait. The accuracy of discrimination between the different 
     degenerative diseases was 51.4%, indicating the similarities in gait 
     patterns between diseases need to be further explored. Overall, the 
     differences between pathologic and healthy gait are distinct enough 
     to classify using a classical machine learning model; however, 
     routinely recorded gait characteristics and anthropometric data are 
     not sufficient for successful discrimination of the degenerative 
     diseases.]

     AB: Abstract. Osteoporosis and loss of muscle mass are secondary 
     issues with spinal cord injury. Robotic gait training has provided 
     evidence of increasing bone density and muscle mass, but its effect 
     on bone strength is undetermined. The purpose of this study was to 
     determine the effect of a 6-week robotic locomotion training program 
     on skeletal muscle mass and bone characteristics. Twelve female 
     Sprague-Dawley rats received a mid-thoracic spinal cord transection 
     at 5 days old and at 3 weeks old were assigned to a Control or 
     Trained Group. The Trained Group performed 5-min sessions on the Rat 
     Stepper 5 days a week for 6 weeks with 90% of body weight supported. 
     At the end of the 6 weeks, body mass was obtained and right femurs 
     and four lower extremity muscles were harvested. Femur bone mineral 
     density was measured with DXA and mechanical characteristics of the 
     femur were determined via 3-point bending testing. Independent 
     t-tests, effects sizes and percent differences were computed between 
     the two groups (p < 0.05). The Trained Group had significantly larger 
     normalized femur mass (p = 0.007) and normalized soleus muscle mass 
     (p = 0.033) when compared to the Control Group. There was a medium or 
     large effect size with the Trained Groups' femurs having larger mass, 
     bone mineral density, rupture loads, cortical wall thickness, shaft 
     cross sectional area, soleus mass, normalized gastrocnemius mass, and 
     smaller shaft inner diameters compared to the Control Group. These 
     changes may contribute to decreasing osteoporosis and fracture risk 
     in those with spinal cord injuries.]

     AB: Abstract. The success of uncemented total ankle replacement (TAR) 
     is linked to initial stability because bony ingrowth depends upon 
     limited early micromotion. Tibial implant design fixation features 
     resist micromotion aided by bony sidewall retention and interference 
     fit. Our goal was to investigate factors influencing implant-bone 
     micromotion in TAR. Two TAR tibial components were virtually inserted 
     into CT-derived computer models of two distal tibias from patients 
     with end-stage ankle arthritis. Density-based inhomogeneous material 
     assignment was used to model bone compaction during press-fit. Finite 
     element analysis (FEA) was used to simulate three fixation cases: (1) 
     no sidewalls + line-to-line fit, (2) sidewalls + line-to-line fit, 
     and (3) sidewalls + 50, 100, or 200 µm interference fit. Kinetic 
     profiles from the stance phase of gait were simulated and 
     micromotions computed from FEA output. Without sidewalls or 
     interference fit, micromotions were largest in early and late stance, 
     with largest micromotions (averaging ~150-250 µm) observed near heel 
     strike. Micromotions decreased 39%-62% when sidewalls were retained. 
     When interference fit was also modeled, micromotions decreased 
     another 37%-61% to ~10 µm. Micromotion differences between patients 
     persisted with sidewall retention but largely disappeared with 
     interference fit. This study presents new insights into the effects 
     of TAR fixation features on implant-bone micromotion. Stability 
     appeared to be influenced by surrounding bone quality, but this 
     influence was greatly diminished when interference fit was 
     introduced. More complete understanding of TAR implant features and 
     performance is needed, but our results show the importance of bone 
     quality and interference fit in the stability of uncemented TAR.]

     AB: Abstract. Talonavicular (TN) fusion is a common treatment for TN 
     arthritis or deformity correction. There is incongruous evidence 
     regarding remaining motion at the talocalcaneal and calcaneocuboid 
     joints after TN fusion. Additionally, the effects of a malaligned TN 
     fusion are not well understood and alignment of the fusion may be 
     important for overall foot integrity. This project assessed the 
     kinematic and kinetic effects of neutral and malaligned TN fusions. 
     Ten cadaveric feet were tested on a gait simulator in four 
     conditions: unfused, fused in neutral, fused in varus, and fused in 
     valgus. The fusions were simulated with external fixation hardware. 
     An eight-camera motion analysis system and a 10-segment foot model 
     generated kinematic data, and a pressure mat captured pressure data. 
     Simulated TN fusion was achieved in eight feet. From unfused to 
     fused-neutral, range of motion (ROM) was not eliminated in the 
     adjacent joints, but the positions of the joints changed 
     significantly throughout stance phase. Furthermore, the ROM increased 
     at the tibiotalar joint. Plantar pressure and center of pressure 
     shifted laterally with neutral fusion. The malalignments marginally 
     affected the ROM but changed joint positions throughout stance phase. 
     Pressure patterns were shifted laterally in varus malalignment and 
     medially in valgus malalignment. The residual motion and the altered 
     kinematics at the joints in the triple joint complex after TN fusion 
     may subsequently increase the incidence of arthritis. Clinical 
     significance: This study quantifies the effects of talonavicular 
     fusion and malalignment on the other joints of the triple joint 
     complex.]

     AB: Abstract. Peripheral nerve injuries are common injuries that 
     often have a drastic effect on patient's activities of daily living 
     and physical function. While techniques for the surgical repair of 
     these injuries have improved over time, rehabilitation methods 
     following these repairs have been non-standardized and under 
     researched. Electronic searches were conducted in Ovid/Medline and 
     SCOPUS to identify articles that discuss rehabilitation and exercise 
     following peripheral nerve injury in animal models and its effects on 
     peripheral nerve regeneration and recovery of function. Thirty-eight 
     articles met inclusion criteria; all were prospective studies in 
     animal models. This systematic review suggests that exercise is a 
     useful tool in returning autonomy to the individual and has 
     beneficial effects in the recovery from peripheral nerve injury. It 
     is beneficial to use rehabilitation exercises following the repair of 
     peripheral nerve injuries to promote regeneration, and timing of that 
     exercise may be just as important as the exercise prescribed. 
     However, further studies with standardized models and outcome 
     measures need to be conducted before translation to clinical trials.]

     Methods. Twenty-four healthy males participated in four sessions 
     before and after EIMD (pre-EIMD, 48 h, 96 h, and 168 h post-EIMD). A 
     single-leg deadlift exercise was performed to provoke EIMD in the 
     hamstrings of the dominant leg. Lower limb function perception, 
     spatiotemporal gait parameters, active knee extension range of 
     motion, and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the semitendinosus 
     and biceps femoris muscles during gait and maximal isometric 
     contraction were assessed bilaterally. Results. At 48 h, the 
     EIMD-side showed reduced step length, active knee extension range of 
     motion, maximal strength and EMG activity compared to baseline (P < 
     0.042), while increased relative EMG activity in the biceps femoris 
     during gait (P = 0.001). At 96 h, step length and EMG activity on the 
     EIMD-side reached similar values to those at baseline, whereas lower 
     limb function perception and active knee extension range of motion 
     returned to baseline state at 168 h post-EIMD. No changes over time 
     were observed on the control-side. Conclusions. Recovery from EIMD 
     requires a multimodal assessment since the different parameters 
     affected by EIMD recover at different paces. Active range of motion 
     appears to be the last variable to fully recover. Self-perceived 
     function should not be considered in isolation as it does not 
     represent complete functional recovery.]

     AB: Abstract. Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability, 
     resulting in aberrant movement. This movement is difficult to measure 
     accurately in clinical practice and gold standard methods, such as 
     optoelectronic systems involve the use of expensive laboratory 
     equipment. Inertial measurement units (IMU) offer an alternative 
     method of quantifying movement that is accessible in most 
     environments. However, there is no consensus around the validity and 
     reliability of IMUs for quantifying lumbar spine movements compared 
     with gold standard measures. The aim of this systematic review was to 
     establish concurrent validity and repeated measures reliability of 
     using IMUs for the measurement of lumbar spine movements in 
     individuals with and without LBP. A systematic search of electronic 
     databases, incorporating PRISMA guidelines was completed, limited to 
     the English language. 503 studies were identified where 15 studies 
     met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 305 individuals were included, 
     and 109 of these individuals had LBP. Weighted synthesis of the 
     results demonstrated root mean squared differences of <2.4° compared 
     to the gold standard and intraclass correlations >0.84 for lumbar 
     spine movements. IMUs offer clinicians and researchers valid and 
     reliable measurement of motion in the lumbar spine, comparable to 
     laboratory methods, such as optoelectronic motion capture for 
     individuals with and without LBP.]

     AB: Abstract. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) surgeries among young 
     patients are on the increase, so it is crucial to predict the 
     lifespan of hip implants correctly and produce solutions to improve 
     longevity. Current implants are designed and tested against walking 
     conditions to predict the wear rates. However, it would be reasonable 
     to include the additional effects of other daily life activities on 
     wear rates to predict convergent results to clinical outputs. In this 
     study, 14 participants are recruited to perform stair ascending (AS), 
     descending (DS), and walking activities to obtain kinematic and 
     kinetic data for each cycle using marker based Qualisys motion 
     capture (MOCAP) system. AnyBody Modeling System using the Calibrated 
     Anatomical System Technique (CAST) full body marker set are performed 
     Multibody simulations. The 3D generic musculoskeletal model used in 
     this study is a marker-based full-body motion capture model 
     (AMMR,2.3.1 MoCapModel) consisting of the upper extremity and the 
     Twente Lower Extremity Model (TLEM2). The dynamic wear prediction 
     model detailing the intermittent and overall wear rates for 
     CoCr-on-XLPE bearing couple is developed to investigate the wear 
     mechanism under 3D loading for AS, DS, and walking activities over 5 
     million cycles (Mc) by using finite element modelling technique. The 
     volumetric wear rates of XLPE liner under AS, DS, and walking 
     activities over 5-Mc are predicted as 27.43, 23.22, and 18.84 mm3/Mc 
     respectively. Additionally, the wear rate was predicted by combining 
     stair activities and gait cycles based on the walk-to-stair ratio. By 
     adding the effect of stair activities, the volumetric wear rate of 
     XLPE is predicted as 22.02 mm3/Mc which is equivalent to 19.41% of 
     walking. In conclusion, in this study, the effect of including other 
     daily life activities is demonstrated and evidence is provided by 
     matching them to the clinical data as opposed to simulator test 
     results of implants under ISO 14242 boundary conditions.]

     AB: Abstract. Scleroderma is a chronic and progressive autoimmune 
     disorder of connective tissues often causing lesions and deformities 
     of the hands. Individuals affected by this condition experience daily 
     life limitations and are typically unable to take part in sport 
     activities that involve impacts on the hands. In this article we 
     describe the design and manufacturing of custom-made hand orthoses to 
     play sitting volleyball, for an elite paralympic athlete affected by 
     scleroderma. The devices consist of a carbon fibre shell with an 
     internal silicone padding and an external polymeric multilayer cover. 
     The manufacturing of the orthoses involves digital modelling, 3D 
     printing, composite lamination and an innovative method to create a 
     strong and durable chemical bonding between silicone and carbon 
     fibre. The internal silicone padding proved to be effective in 
     hosting and protecting the hands, whereas the external shell with 
     polymeric multilayer cover allowed to dampen the ball shocks while 
     effectively hitting the ball. Indeed, these devices allowed the 
     athlete to take part in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic games and were used 
     for two years without showing any damage.]

     positive effects of strength training have been reported in men with 
     DM1, but its impact on women remains unknown. We evaluated the 
     effects of a 12-week supervised strength training on physical and 
     neuropsychiatric health. Women with DM1 performed a twice-weekly 
     supervised resistance training program (3 series of 6-8 repetitions 
     of squat, leg press, plantar flexion, knee extension, and hip 
     abduction). Lower limb muscle strength, physical function, apathy, 
     anxiety and depression, fatigue and excessive somnolence, pain, and 
     patient-reported outcomes were assessed before and after the 
     intervention, as well as three and six months after completion of the 
     training program. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were also 
     taken before and after the training program to assess muscle fiber 
     growth. Eleven participants completed the program (attendance: 98.5 
     %). Maximal hip and knee extension strength (p < 0.006), all 
     One-Repetition Maximum strength measures (p < 0.001), apathy (p = 
     0.0005), depression (p = 0.02), pain interference (p = 0.01) and 
     perception of the lower limb function (p = 0.003) were significantly 
     improved by training. Some of these gains were maintained up to six 
     months after the training program. Strength training is a good 
     therapeutic strategy for women with DM1.]

     AB: Abstract. There is a growing debate among scholars regarding the 
     impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the employment 
     opportunities and professional development of people with disability. 
     Although there has been an increasing body of empirical research on 
     the topic, it has generally yielded conflicting findings. This study 
     contributes to the ongoing debate by examining the linear and 
     nonlinear effects of AI on the unemployment of people with disability 
     in 40 countries between 2007 and 2021. Using the system Generalized 
     Methods of Moments and panel smooth transition regression, the main 
     conclusions are as follows. First, AI reduces the unemployment of 
     people with disability in the full sample. Second, upon 
     disaggregating the sample based on income level (high income/non-high 
     income) and gender (men/women), the linear model only detects an 
     inverse correlation between AI and unemployment among people with 
     disability in high-income countries and among men, whereas it does 
     not influence unemployment in non-high-income countries and women. 
     Third, the panel smooth transition regression model suggests that the 
     effects of AI on the unemployment of people with disability and among 
     women are only observed once artificial intelligence interest search 
     exceeds a specific threshold level. The effects of AI in 
     non-high-income economies and among women are not significant in the 
     lower regime, which confirms the nonlinear association between AI and 
     the unemployment rate of people with disability. These findings have 
     important policy implications for facilitating the integration of 
     people with disability into the labor market.]

     study aimed to examine the support provided to employees with 
     disabilities in Saudi Arabia. The descriptive approach was utilized, 
     and a survey was used to collect the data. The sample consisted of 86 
     employer participants to examine the support of their employees with 
     disabilities. Findings revealed that the support provided was high, 
     and the participants reported that such support facilitates finding 
     and maintaining a job. In addition, the variables were all found to 
     have no significant differences. Providing needed and necessary

     for individuals with disabilities, especially for the long term. 
     Implications and recommendations are also discussed.]

     AB: Abstract. Background. Physically active learning (PAL) is a 
     potentially valuable method to stimulate academic performance and 
     physical activity (PA) in children with learning disorders (LD) 
     attending special-needs schools. It is yet unknown whether PAL can be 
     successfully implemented in special-needs schools. Aims. This study 
     aimed to evaluate a PAL-program in special-needs schools by examining 
     teacher's dose delivered, children's dose received, and associations 
     of children's characteristics with dose received. Methods. Children 
     (N = 37) from two special-needs schools participated in a six-week 
     PAL-program. Dose delivered was evaluated based on PAL-lessons' 
     implementation rate and duration. Dose received was assessed through 
     time-on-task observations (n = 23) and PA (n = 37). To assess the 
     association between dose received and children's characteristics 
     (sex, behavioral disorders, motor skills, and physical fitness), 
     Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearman's rho correlations were used. 
     Results. For teacher's dose delivered, the implementation rate 
     exceeded 95%, and the PAL-lessons lasted the intended 12 minutes. For 
     dose received, children's on-task behavior was above 79%, and 
     children spent 43% of the time in moderate-to-vigorous PA during PAL. 
     Motor skills were positively related to on-task behavior related to 
     the movements, and physical fitness was positively related to 
     moderate-to-vigorous PA. Conclusions. PAL was successfully 
     implemented in terms of dose delivered and dose received for children 
     with LD attending special-needs schools.]

     with CP (male n = 17; 76.2%), mean age 9 y 8 m, SD 1 y 1 month (range 
     8 y 3 m to 12 y 6 m) were randomised into the intervention group (n = 
     9) or a waitlist control group. A mixed-methods approach with an 
     explanatory sequential design was used, with a randomised controlled 
     trial followed by qualitative interviews. Participants were assessed 
     on measures of intelligence, academic ability, attention and 
     executive functioning, and social-emotional functioning at baseline, 
     then after completing the training, or the waitlist period. Analyses 
     included ANCOVAs and paired samples t tests. Semi-structured 
     interviews explored participants' experiences with the training. 
     Results and Outcomes. Training completion was low with a mean of 16.9 
     modules completed out of 55 available. No significant effect of 
     training was found for the primary outcome of intelligence, or for 
     any secondary outcomes. Participants reported barriers and

     were assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental 
     group underwent a 12-week aquatic exercise intervention, while the 
     control group engaged in supervised free activities. Pre- and 
     post-intervention assessments measured EF and BDNF levels. Outcomes 
     and results. The experimental group showed significant improvements 
     (p < 0.05) in inhibition control, cognitive flexibility, and BDNF 
     levels. However, working memory did not significantly improve. The 
     control group exhibited no significant changes in EF or BDNF levels. 
     Conclusions and implications. Aquatic exercise appears to be a 
     beneficial intervention for cognitive development in children with 
     ASD, as it enhances inhibition control, cognitive flexibility, and 
     BDNF levels in children with ASD. Furthermore, the observed 
     improvements in EF following aquatic exercise intervention in 
     children with ASD may be associated with increased BDNF levels.]

     AB: Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) has become prevalent over the last 
     decade after performing spin classes. ER is characterized by the 
     plasma elevation of creatine kinase as a marker of severe muscle 
     damage. This case study highlights a 26-year-old healthy male that 
     suffered from ER after performing their first ever spin class. The 
     acute and chronic management of the ER is described, along with 
     follow-up assessments that tracked the recovery following discharge 
     from the hospital. Symptoms, such as localized swelling with complete 
     loss of mobility and pain disproportionate to soreness, were 
     characteristic in this individual with ER. Examining the 
     concentration of plasma creatine kinase and monitoring urine output 
     and color provided a good measure to determine when to discharge the 
     patient. Management wise, ambulation should be minimized, and 
     complete bed rest is ideal in conjunction with fluid replacement 
     therapy. Although the individual in this case study did not develop 
     compartment syndrome, its occurrence is always a possibility that 
     should be routinely screened for. Lastly, further research is

     AB: Concussion is one of the most challenging injuries for sports 
     medicine clinicians. It is crucial that students develop high 
     self-efficacy for concussion-relevant skills during professional 
     education, as it impacts the quality of their patient care. This 
     study aimed to explore Irish final year athletic therapy students' 
     self-efficacy in concussion assessment and management and the factors 
     that impact its development. Participants' level of self-efficacy 
     varied, from low to high, depending on the skill assessed. Lack of 
     practice and lecturer's positive feedback impacted student 
     self-efficacy the most. Educators should provide students with an 
     opportunity to practice their skills in an environment that 
     facilitates feedback.]

     AB: Low back pain (LBP) is a common injury in golf. There are several 
     outcomes used to quantify LBP-related disability, such as core 
     endurance tests and questionnaires. The primary purpose of this study 
     was to compare clinical outcomes between college golfers with and 
     without LBP. A secondary purpose was to determine relationships 
     between these measures. We found no difference between groups for 
     Biering-Sørensen endurance (p = .558). Episodes of LBP were 
     significantly related to the Oswestry Disability Index (ρ = .491)

     AB: Shoulder subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a mechanical 
     disturbance caused by a multifactorial aetiology, and conservative 
     treatment is the first choice. This study aims to investigate the 
     combined short-term effect of manual therapy and eccentric exercise 
     conditioning on clinical outcomes in the acute phase. We recruited 
     126 subjects with a SIS of 3 months' duration and divided them into 
     two groups of 63 people each. The experimental group received manual 
     therapy and eccentric exercise; the control group received concentric 
     exercise, spread over 3 weeks, followed by a home program for another 
     9 weeks. Pain intensity, shoulder elevation range, abductor and 
     external rotator muscle strength, and regional function were obtained 
     at baseline, after 10 sessions of treatment and follow-up at 12 
     weeks. After the first session and by the end of 3 weeks, a global 
     rating of change (GRC) questionnaire was administered to determine 
     self-perceived improvement. An analysis of variance with repeated 
     measures was applied, and the results showed that there were 
     statistically significant differences in both groups; all outcomes 
     improved after treatment and during follow-up (P < 0.005). However, 
     on intergroup analysis, significant improvement was observed with 
     pain intensity (P < 0.0005), elevation range of motion (P < 0.05) and 
     external rotator muscle strength (P < 0.016) after treatment, and 
     external rotator muscle strength and SPADI score (P < 0.0005) at 
     follow-up by 12 weeks in the experimental group. The between-group 
     comparison revealed that pain reduction by 3 weeks, external rotator 
     muscle strength by 3 and 12 weeks, had resulted in a large effect 
     size. Manual therapy and eccentric exercise can reduce pain 
     intensity, improve shoulder elevation range, and gleno-humeral muscle 
     strength after 12 weeks of training better than concentric exercises. 
     The improvement in shoulder function with the experimental group 
     exceeded the MCID of 13 points, resulting in a large and significant 
     effect size (d = 1.08). The self-perceived improvement (GRC) was 
     significant in the experimental group (P < 0.001) with a clinically 
     significant change greater than the MCID (3 points).]

     AB: Advances in healthcare and technology have led to increased 
     survival rates after spinal cord injury (SCI). To facilitate 
     recovery, regain function, and promote quality of life after SCI, 
     rehabilitation in the acute care setting is of paramount importance. 
     After discharge from acute care, there is difficulty in accessing 
     appropriate intervention to facilitate community reintegration. This 
     review examined the content, strengths, limitations, and 
     effectiveness of existing community reintegration intervention 
     programs after SCI to promote the adoption of the existing programs 
     or the development of new interventions for individuals with SCI in a 
     low-resource setting. We conducted a review of the literature using 
     Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. Six electronic 
     databases were searched from the database inception to September 
     2022, including Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Sabinet, 
     and Global Health. A manual search of the selected references was 
     also conducted. Seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Overall, 
     290 individuals participated in the included studies, 80% of the 
     participants were males, and the majority of the participants had an 
     injury at the thoracic level. The studies presented different 
     interventional programs with varying contents addressing different 
     aspects of community reintegration such as household duties, 
     mobility, health maintenance, and recreation. All the identified 
     programs have evidence of preliminary effectiveness in some domains 
     of community reintegration (e.g. household duties, mobility, and 
     health). However, most available programs are geared toward 
     addressing a specific aspect of community reintegration and may not 
     be suitable for individuals with complex needs. A robust program that 
     encompasses all critical aspects of community reintegration (housing 
     and household duties, mobility, recreation, health maintenance, pain 
     management, sexuality, social support, and employment) may be 
     required. Therefore, further development and validation of existing 
     programs are warranted.]

     AB: Background: Stroke has become the second leading cause of death 
     worldwide, accounting for over 10% of total deaths as per a report 
     published by the American Health Association. Motor and cognitive 
     impairments have been known to be associated with stroke survivors, 
     with reports of up to 75% of post-stroke patients suffering from 
     debilitating disabilities that prevent them from living 
     independently. Motor disability is often attributed to muscle 
     weakness, thereby affecting their gait and balance. So, the present 
     systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence on the effects of 
     aerobic and resistance exercises improving balance, functional 
     capacity, and pulmonary function among post-stroke patients. 
     Methodology: A systematic review was conducted and registered with 
     OSF registry (https: doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DWVUF). This systematic 
     review was conducted based on the following PRISMA guidelines. A 
     comprehensive search strategy identifying effect of aerobic and 
     resistance exercise training on post-stroke patients was developed 
     using electronic databases such as PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Embase, 
     and Cochrane Central between the years January 2000 to June 2022. 
     Randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews are the study 
     designs that were included in the present review. Methodological 
     quality assessment was done using mixed methods appraisal (MMAT) 
     tool. Data on characteristics of intervention and outcome measures 
     were extracted. Results: The search yielded 944 articles, and after 
     the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 studies 
     were considered for the final analysis. The mixed methods appraisal 
     tool was used to appraise the quality of the studies included. Data 
     extracted from each study included the first author's name, year of 
     publication, study design, and outcome measures wherever applicable. 
     Balance, muscle strength, pulmonary function, and functional capacity 
     were the outcomes included. Conclusion: Great strides have been made 
     in terms of progress for management options for stroke-induced 
     physical limitations, and a growing number of studies have linked 
     exercise to improved physical activity in post-stroke patients. 
     However, further studies and evidence are needed to determine the 
     long-lasting impacts of aerobic and resistance exercises on balance, 
     muscle strength, pulmonary function, and functional capacity.]

     reliability and minimal detectable change (MDC) of the timed up and 
     go (TUG) test in older adults with peripheral vestibular 
     hypofunction. A pragmatic descriptive design was used on the data 
     collected on 16 patients. Inclusion criteria were age 65 years or 
     older evaluated in physical therapy for symptoms of dizziness and/or 
     postural instability, able to walk without the physical help of 
     another person, and able to follow commands and perform the 
     examination instructions in English. Exclusion criteria were unstable 
     medical issues, orthostatic hypotension, uncontrolled metabolic 
     disease; history of falls from syncopal origin; dizziness of central 
     origin, active benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and inability to 
     walk without physical assistance. After the patients gave informed 
     consent and met the inclusion criteria, the patients performed one 
     practice trial followed by two final performances of the TUG that 
     were included in the data analysis. The TUG test measures the time it 
     takes to stand up from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, get 
     back to the chair, and sit down. The TUG showed excellent 
     reliability. TUG has small values for both standard error of 
     measurement (0.46 seconds) and MDC90 (1.07 seconds). The 
     generalization of results of TUG test−retest is limited among the 
     older adults with subacute and chronic peripheral vestibular 
     hypofunction. The test−retest reliability of the TUG for older 
     adults with peripheral vestibular hypofunction is equivalent to that 
     of older adults with other conditions.]

     AB: Abstract. Background: Wrestling is a physically demanding sport 
     with young athletes prone to traumatic shoulder instability and a 
     paucity of data evaluating the results of shoulder instability 
     surgery (SIS). Purpose: To assess reoperation rates, patient-reported 
     outcomes, and return to wrestling (RTW) after SIS in a cohort of 
     competitive wrestlers. Study. Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 
     3. Methods: All competitive wrestlers with a history of shoulder 
     instability and subsequent surgery at a single institution between 
     1996 and 2020 were identified. All directions of shoulder instability 
     (anterior shoulder instability [ASI], posterior shoulder instability 
     [PSI], and traumatic multidirectional shoulder instability [TMDI]) 
     were analyzed. Exclusions included revision SIS and <2 years of 
     follow-up. Athletes were contacted for determination of 
     complications, RTW, and Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index 
     scores. Results: Ultimately, 104 wrestlers were included with a mean 
     age at initial instability of 16.9 years (range, 12.0-22.7 years), 
     mean age at surgery of 18.9 years (range, 14.0-29.0 years), and a 
     mean follow-up of 5.2 years (range, 2.0-22.0 years). A total of 58 
     (55.8%) wrestlers were evaluated after a single shoulder instability 
     event, while 46 (44.2%) sustained multiple events before evaluation. 
     ASI was the most common direction (n = 79; 76.0%), followed by PSI (n 
     = 14; 13.5%) and TMDI (n = 11; 10.6%). Surgical treatment was most 
     commonly an arthroscopic soft tissue stabilization (n = 88; 84.6%), 
     with open soft tissue repair (n = 13; 12.5%) and open bony 
     augmentation (n = 3; 2.9%) performed less frequently. RTW occurred in 
     57.3% of wrestlers at a mean of 9.8 months. Recurrent instability was 
     the most common complication, occurring in 18 (17.3%) wrestlers. 
     Revision SIS was performed in 15 (14.4%) wrestlers. Across the entire 
     cohort, survivorship rates free from recurrent instability and 
     revision surgery were 90.4% and 92.5% at 2 years, 71.9% and 70.7% at 
     5 years, and 71.9% and 66.5% at 10 years, respectively. Preoperative 
     recurrent instability was an independent risk factor for 
     postoperative recurrent instability (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95% CI, 
     1.33-11.03; P = .012). Conclusion: Competitive wrestlers with 
     multiple dislocations before initial clinical evaluation were 3.8 
     times more likely to experience postoperative recurrent instability. 
     Patients should be counseled that despite SIS, only 57.3% returned to 
     wrestling after surgery.]

     AB: Abstract. Background: A limited number of studies have reported 
     the long-term effectiveness of and associated factors for recurrence 
     of anterior shoulder instability after arthroscopic Bankart repair 
     (ABR). Purpose: To report the long-term clinical outcomes after ABR 
     in a recreational sports population and identify the associated 
     factors that influence the final instability status. Study. Design: 
     Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective study was 
     performed in patients treated with ABR between 2007 and 2013 by a 
     single surgeon. Patient data, magnetic resonance imaging measurements 
     of bone loss and glenoid track, and intra- and perioperative factors 
     were analyzed. After a minimum follow-up of 10 years, 
     patient-reported outcomes including the Western Ontario Shoulder 
     Instability Index score, the Rowe score, the visual analog scale for 
     pain and function, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, 
     and sports activity were assessed. The current instability status was 
     classified into 3 groups: stable, apprehensive, and redislocated. 
     These groups were statistically compared with respect to outcomes and 
     associated factors. Results: A total of 100 patients with a mean age 
     of 22.4 ± 5.5 years and a mean follow-up of 12.7 ± 2.1 years were 
     included. At the final follow-up, 38 patients (38%) showed recurrent 
     symptoms: 19 patients (19%) with subjective apprehension and 19 
     patients (19%) with redislocation, including 10 patients (10%) with 
     revision surgery. At the final follow-up, the redislocated group 
     showed the lowest patient-reported outcomes and return to sports 
     (both P < .001). The apprehensive group also showed a lower Western 
     Ontario Shoulder Instability Index score (P = .011), Rowe score (P = 
     .003), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (P = .027), and 
     return to sports (P = .005) than the stable group. Participation in 
     contact sports (P = .026), glenoid bone loss (P = .005), size of 
     Hill-Sachs lesion (P = .009), and off-track lesions (P = .016) were 
     all associated with recurrent symptoms, whereas age <20 years (P = 
     .012), participation in contact sports (P = .003), and off-track 
     lesions (P = .042) were associated with redislocation. Conclusion: 
     After long-term follow-up in a recreational sports population, ABR 
     demonstrated a 19% rate of subjective apprehension and 19% rate of 
     redislocation, with a gradual decline in clinical outcomes and sports 
     activity over time. Therefore, candidates for ABR should be selected 
     based on consideration of risk factors such as off-track lesions, age 
     <20 years, and participation in contact sports.]

     undertaking anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR), 
     although a lack of high-quality evidence exists comparing quadriceps 
     (QT) and hamstring (HT) autografts. Purpose: To investigate patient 
     outcomes in patients undergoing HT versus QT ACLR. Study. Design: 
     Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: After 
     recruitment and randomization, 112 patients (HT = 55; QT = 57) 
     underwent ACLR. Patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively (6 
     weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months), with a range of patient-reported 
     outcome measures (PROMs), graft laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer; primary 
     outcome variable), active knee flexion and extension range of motion 
     (ROM), peak isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength, and a 6-hop 
     performance battery. Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated for 
     strength and hop measures. Secondary procedures, ACL retears, and 
     contralateral ACL tears were reported. Results: All PROMs and knee 
     ROM measures significantly improved (P < .0001), and no other group 
     differences (P > .05) were observed-apart from the Anterior Cruciate 
     Ligament Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) score, which was 
     significantly better in the HT group at 3 (P = .008), 6 (P = .010), 
     and 12 (P = .014) months. No significant changes were observed in 
     side-to-side laxity from 6 to 24 months (P = .105), and no group 
     differences were observed (P = .487) at 6 (HT mean, 1.2; QT mean, 
     1.3), 12 (HT mean, 1.1; QT mean, 1.3), and 24 (HT mean, 1.1; QT mean, 
     1.2) months. While the HT group demonstrated significantly greater (P 
     < .05) quadriceps strength LSIs at 6 and 12 months, the QT group 
     showed significantly greater (P < .05) hamstring strength LSIs at 6, 
     12, and 24 months. The HT group showed significantly greater (P < 
     .05) LSIs for the single horizontal (6 months), lateral (6 and 12 
     months), and medial (6 months) hop tests for distance. Up until 24 
     months, 1 patient (QT at 22 months) had a retear, with 2 
     contralateral ACL tears (QT at 19 months; HT at 23 months). Secondary 
     procedures included 5 in the HT group (manipulation under anesthesia, 
     notch debridement, meniscal repair, and knee arthroscopy for scar 
     tissue) and 6 in the QT group (notch debridement, meniscal repair, 
     knee arthroscopy for scar tissue, tibial tubercle transfer, and 
     osteochondral autologous transplantation). Conclusion: Apart from the 
     ACL-RSI, the 2 autograft groups compared well for PROMs, knee ROM, 
     and laxity. However, greater hamstring strength LSIs were observed 
     for the QT cohort, with greater quadriceps strength (and hop test) 
     LSIs in the HT cohort. The longer-term review will continue to 
     evaluate return to sports and later-stage reinjury between the 2 
     graft constructs.]

     feedback on running technique and running speed by wearables may help 
     reduce injury risk. Purpose: To investigate whether real-time 
     feedback on spatiotemporal metrics and relative speed by commercially 
     available pressure-sensitive insoles would reduce running injuries 
     and improve running performance compared with no real-time feedback. 
     Study. Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. 
     Methods: A total of 220 recreational runners were randomly assigned 
     into the intervention and control groups. Both groups received 
     pressure-sensitive insoles, but only the intervention group received 
     real-time feedback on spatiotemporal metrics and relative speed. The 
     feedback aimed to reduce loading on the joint/segment estimated to 
     exhibit the highest load. Injury rates were compared between the 
     groups using Cox regressions. Secondary outcomes compared included 
     injury severity, the proportion of runners with multiple injuries, 
     changes in self-reported personal best times and motivation 
     (Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2), and interest in 
     continuing wearable use after study completion. Results: A total of 
     160 participants (73%) were included in analyses of the primary 
     outcome. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference 
     in injury rate between the groups (Hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; P = .70). 
     This was expected, as 53 of 160 (33%) participants ended up in the 
     unassigned group because they used incorrect wearable settings, 
     nullifying any interventional effects. As-treated analysis showed a 
     significantly lower injury rate among participants receiving 
     real-time feedback (HR, 0.53; P = .03). Similarly, the first-time 
     injury severity was significantly lower (-0.43; P = .042). 
     Per-protocol analysis showed no significant differences in injury 
     rates, but the direction favored the intervention group (HR, 0.67; P 
     = .30). There were no significant differences in the proportion of 
     patients with multiple injuries (HR, 0.82; P = .40) or changes in 
     running performance (3.07%; P = .26) and motivation. Also, ~60% of 
     the participants who completed the study showed interest in 
     continuing wearable use. Conclusion: Real-time feedback on 
     spatiotemporal metrics and relative speed provided by commercially 
     available instrumented insoles may reduce the rate and severity of 
     injuries in recreational runners. Feedback did not influence running 
     performance and exercise motivation.]

     AB: Abstract. Background: A number of studies have investigated 
     return to play after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) 
     in professional soccer players, but it is unclear which factors are 
     associated with a return to the preinjury performance and ability to 
     play over time. Purpose: To identify factors that contribute to a 
     professional soccer player's return to preinjury performance after 
     ACLR, as well as to report their playing performance at 2 and 5 years 
     after ACLR compared with their preinjury performance. Study. Design: 
     Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A consecutive 
     cohort of professional soccer players undergoing primary ACLR were 
     analyzed between 2005 and 2019. A minimum 2-year follow-up was 
     required. The effect of patient, surgical, and postoperative factors 
     on performance rates, defined as a combination of league level and 
     playing time, was evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic 
     regression models. Results: A total of 200 male professional soccer 
     players were included. When combining league level and playing time, 
     30% of athletes returned to their preinjury performance at 2 years 
     and 22% at 5 years. However, 53% of athletes returned to their 
     preinjury performance for at least 1 season by year 5. At 2 years, a 
     chondral lesion of grade 3 or 4 decreased the odds of return to 
     preinjury performance (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; P = .010). Athletes 
     receiving an ACLR with the addition of a lateral extra-articular 
     tenodesis procedure were 2.42 times more likely to return to 
     preinjury performance at 2 years than athletes with ACLR alone (P = 
     .004). By 5 years after ACLR, athletes aged ≥25 years at the time 
     of reconstruction were 3 times less likely to be performing at their 
     preinjury performance (OR, 0.32; P < .001), and those with a grade 
     ≥3 chondral lesion were >2 times less likely to be performing at 
     their preinjury performance (OR, 0.43; P = .033). Conclusion: The 
     presence of >50% thickness chondral pathology, ACLR without lateral 
     extra-articular tenodesis, and age >25 years at the time of surgery 
     were all significant risk factors of worse performance rates after 
     ACLR. Significant decreases in performance rates were noted at 2 and 
     5 years postoperatively.]

     AB: Abstract. Background: Reconstruction using autograft remains the 
     gold standard surgical treatment for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) 
     injuries. However, up to 10% to 15% of patients will suffer a graft 
     failure in the future. Cadaveric studies have demonstrated that the 
     addition of suture tape augmentation to ACL autograft constructs can 
     increase graft strength and reduce elongation under cyclical loading. 
     Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to investigate the clinical 
     outcomes and rerupture rates after ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with 
     suture tape augmentation. We hypothesized that augmentation with 
     suture tape would lead to lower rerupture rates. Study. Design: Case 
     series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients undergoing primary 
     ACLR using hamstring or patellar tendon autografts augmented with 
     suture tape between 2015 and 2019 were recruited prospectively. 
     Patients with multiligament injuries or a concomitant lateral 
     extra-articular procedure were excluded. Patients were observed in 
     person for 6 months, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) 
     were collected at 2 and 5 years postoperatively. All patients were 
     contacted, and records were reviewed to determine the incidence of 
     graft failure. PROMs collected were as follows: Knee injury and 
     Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Veterans RAND 12-Item Health 
     Survey (VR-12), Tegner and Marx activity scores, and visual analog 
     scale for pain (VAS). Results: A total of 97 patients, with a mean 
     age of 34.7 (±13.4) years, were included (76% men; 52 hamstring and 
     45 patellar tendon grafts). The mean graft diameter was 8 (±1) mm. 
     There was 1 rerupture (1.1%) out of the 90 patients who were 
     contactable at a mean of 5 years postoperatively. Median KOOS scores 
     at 2 years were as follows: Pain, 94; Symptoms, 86; Activities of 
     Daily Living, 99; Sport and Recreation, 82; and Quality of Life, 81. 
     The postoperative scores were significantly higher than the 
     preoperative scores (P < .001). The VR-12 Physical score improved 
     from 43 preoperatively to 55 at 2 years and remained at 56 at 5 
     years. The VAS pain, Tegner, and Marx scores were 0, 6, and 9, 
     respectively, at 2 years postoperatively. There was no difference in 
     PROMs between graft types. Conclusion: This study demonstrates 
     encouraging results of suture tape augmentation of autograft ACLR for 
     both hamstring and patellar tendon grafts. The failure rate of 1.1% 
     at a mean follow-up of 5 years is lower than published rates for 
     reconstruction, and PROMs results are satisfactory. The technique is 
     safe to use and may permit a return to the preinjury sporting level 
     with a lower chance of reinjury.]

     AB: Abstract. Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury 
     increases risks for osteoarthritis (OA), a poorly modifiable and 
     disabling condition. Joint changes of potentially reversible pre-OA 
     have been described just 2 years after ACL reconstruction (ACLR) when 
     early bone shape changes have also been reported. Purpose: This study 
     evaluates relationships between interlimb differences in tibiofemoral 
     bone shape derived from statistical shape modeling (SSM) of magnetic 
     resonance imaging (MRI) and participant factors on patient-reported 
     outcomes 2 years after unilateral ACLR. Study. Design: 
     Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: SSM-derived 
     tibiofemoral bone shape and subchondral bone area were assessed from 
     bilateral knee MRI scans of 72 participants with unilateral ACLR 
     (mean age, 34 ± 11 years; 32 women) and compared with a reference 
     cohort of 398 older individuals without OA (mean age, 50 ± 3 years; 
     213 women). Multivariable logistic regression models examined 
     relationships between participant and surgical factors with interlimb 
     differences in bone shapes or subchondral bone areas. Relationships 
     between patient-reported outcomes and the interlimb differences in 
     bone shape and subchondral area were examined using similar models. 
     Results: Bone shape scores and subchondral bone areas were greater 
     (more OA-like) in ACLR knees than uninjured contralateral knees in 
     every bone metric tested (P≤ .001). Interlimb differences in femur 
     shape scores of participants with ACLR were 65% greater (P < .001) 
     than those of the significantly older reference cohort. Taller 
     height, medial meniscal tears, and decreasing age were associated 
     with larger interlimb differences in shape scores and subchondral 
     areas (P < .05). Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft 
     recipients demonstrated greater interlimb subchondral area 
     differences compared with allograft recipients (P < .05). Interlimb 
     differences for hamstring autograft recipients did not differ from 
     those with BPTB or allograft. Greater interlimb differences in medial 
     femur subchondral areas were associated with worse patient-reported 
     Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Symptoms (R = 0.27; P = 
     .040). Conclusion: Even in the absence of radiographic OA, just 2 
     years after unilateral ACLR patients showed greater bone shape scores 
     and subchondral areas consistent with pre-OA in their ACLR knees. 
     Furthermore, greater medial femur bone areas were weakly associated 
     with worse symptoms. Patients who are younger, are taller, have 
     meniscal tears, or have BPTB grafts may be at increased risk for bony 
     asymmetries 2 years after ACLR.]

     AB: Abstract. Background: Elbow ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) 
     injuries can result in significant functional impairment in throwing 
     and overhead athletes. UCL reconstruction and repair are proven 
     treatments to restore stability, but the efficacy of nonoperative 
     management is unclear. Purpose: To determine the rate of return to 
     sports (RTS) and return to previous level of play (RTLP) in athletes 
     sustaining medial elbow ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries 
     treated nonoperatively. Study. Design: Systematic review; Level of 
     evidence, 4. Methods: A literature search was performed using Scopus, 
     PubMed, Medline, the Cochrane Database for Systematic Review, and the 
     Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials according to the 2020 
     PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
     Meta-Analyses) statement. Inclusion criteria were limited to level 1 
     to 4 human studies reporting on RTS outcomes after nonoperative 
     management of UCL injuries. Results: A total of 15 studies, 
     consisting of 365 patients with a mean age of 20.45 ± 3.26 years, 
     were identified. Treatment primarily consisted of platelet-rich 
     plasma (PRP) injections with physical therapy (n = 189 patients; n = 
     7 studies) versus physical therapy alone (n = 176 patients; n = 8 
     studies). The overall RTS rate was 79.7% and the overall RTLP rate 
     was 77.9%. Increasing UCL injury severity grade was associated with 
     lower RTS rates. The RTS rate for proximal tears (89.7%; n = 61/68) 
     was significantly greater than that for distal tears (41.2%; n = 
     14/34) (P < .0001). No significant difference in RTS rate was seen in 
     patients treated with PRP versus those who did not receive PRP (P = 
     .757). Conclusion: For athletes undergoing nonoperative management of 
     UCL injuries, the overall RTS and RTLP rates were 79.7% and 77.9%, 
     respectively, with excellent outcomes in grade 1 and grade 2 UCL 
     injuries, specifically. The RTS rate for proximal tears was 
     significantly higher than that for distal tears. Athletes were most 
     commonly treated with PRP injection and physical therapy.]

     AB: Abstract. Background: An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury 
     accompanied by patellar instability (PI) is a topic that has gained 
     orthopaedic surgeons' attention recently. Untreated PI is reportedly 
     associated with worse clinical outcomes after isolated ACL 
     reconstruction (ACLR) in patients after an ACL injury with PI. 
     Nevertheless, the appropriate surgical approach and its long-term 
     therapeutic effects in these patients remain unclear. Purpose: (1) To 
     compare the clinical and radiological outcomes between isolated ACLR 
     (iACLR) and combined ACLR and medial patellofemoral ligament 
     reconstruction (cAMR) in patients after an ACL injury with PI and (2) 
     to explore the correlations between these 2 procedures and clinical 
     and radiological outcomes. Study. Design: Cohort study; Level of 
     evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 106 patients diagnosed with an ACL 
     injury accompanied by PI between January 2016 and April 2021 were 
     analyzed in this study. There were 34 patients excluded because of 
     missing postoperative radiological data. Among the remaining 72 
     patients, 34 patients underwent iACLR, while 38 patients underwent 
     cAMR. Demographic characteristics, intraoperative findings, and 
     patient-reported outcomes (Lysholm score, subjective International 
     Knee Documentation Committee score, and Tegner activity score) were 
     prospectively collected. Patellar alignment parameters and worsening 
     patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) features (evaluated with the 
     modified Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score) were analyzed 
     longitudinally on magnetic resonance imaging. The Kujala score was 
     used to evaluate the functional recovery of the patellofemoral joint, 
     and redislocations of the patella were prospectively recorded. 
     Finally, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to 
     explore the correlations between these 2 procedures and clinical (not 
     achieving the minimal detectable change [MDC] for the Lysholm score) 
     and radiological (worsening PFOA features) outcomes. Results: The 
     mean follow-up duration was 28.9 ± 6.2 and 27.1 ± 6.8 months for 
     the iACLR and cAMR groups, respectively (P = .231). Significantly 
     higher Lysholm scores (88.3 ± 9.9 vs 82.1 ± 11.1, respectively; P = 
     .016) and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee 
     scores (83.6 ± 11.9 vs 78.3 ± 10.2, respectively; P = .046) were 
     detected in the cAMR group compared with the iACLR group 
     postoperatively. The rates of return to preinjury sports were 20.6% 
     and 44.7% in the iACLR and cAMR groups, respectively (difference, 
     24.1% [95% CI, 3.3%-45.0%]; P = .030). Moreover, the rates of 
     worsening PFOA features were 44.1% and 18.4% in the iACLR and cAMR 
     groups, respectively (difference, 25.7% [95% CI, 4.9%-46.4%]; P = 
     .018). In addition, significantly higher Kujala scores (87.9 ± 11.3 
     vs 80.1 ± 12.0, respectively; P = .006), lower redislocation rates 
     (0.0% vs 11.8%, respectively; difference, 11.8% [95% CI, 0.9%-22.6%]; 
     P = .045), and significantly better patellar alignment were detected 
     in the cAMR group compared with the iACLR group postoperatively. 
     Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis determined 
     that iACLR and partial lateral meniscectomy were significantly 
     correlated with not achieving the MDC for the Lysholm score and 
     worsening PFOA features in our study population. Conclusion: In 
     patients after an ACL injury with PI, cAMR yielded better clinical 
     and radiological outcomes compared with iACLR, with better patellar 
     stability and a lower proportion of worsening PFOA features. 
     Furthermore, not achieving the MDC for the Lysholm score and 
     worsening PFOA features were significantly correlated with iACLR and 
     partial lateral meniscectomy. Our study suggests that cAMR may be a 
     more appropriate procedure for patients after an ACL injury with PI, 
     which warrants further high-level clinical evidence.]

     AB: Abstract. Background: Proximal hamstring complex injury (PHCI) is 
     a common injury among professional athletes, particularly those 
     participating in pivot contact sports. Previous studies have 
     suggested that surgery can be effective in restoring function and 
     allowing athletes to return to sport (RTS), but the factors 
     influencing successful RTS have been less clear. Purpose: To assess 
     RTS capabilities after surgical treatment of PHCI in professional 
     athletes and to identify favorable predictors of RTS. Study. Design: 
     Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: This study (2002-2022) 
     was conducted on professional athletes who underwent surgical 
     treatment for PHCI at a sports surgery center. The primary outcome of 
     the study was the RTS capability, evaluated based on the rate of 
     athletes' return to their preinjury level of competition, time delay 
     to RTS, and quality of RTS as measured using their level of 
     performance and progression of scores on activity scales such as the 
     Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) and University of California, Los Angeles 
     (UCLA), scale. "Maintained performance" was defined as athletes 
     returning to the same preinjury activity level (per the TAS and UCLA 
     scale) and perceiving themselves to have maintained their 
     performance. Secondary outcomes covered the potential RTS predictors 
     and complication rate. The study distinguished 2 types of PHCI: 
     proximal hamstring tendon avulsion injury (proximal rupture with 
     empty footprint, or having a "positive dropped ice cream sign") and 
     complete proximal hamstring free tendon rupture (PHTR; proximal 
     rupture without empty footprint, or having a "negative dropped ice 
     cream sign"). Results: The study examined 64 professional athletes 
     (mean age, 27.3 years; 82.8% male) undergoing surgery for PHCI. The 
     RTS rate was 98.4%, with 78.1% of the athletes returning to their 
     preinjury level of competition at 6.2 months (SD, 2.5 months). Twelve 
     (19%) patients had returned to sport at an inferior level of 
     competition, and 2 (3.1%) were unable to continue in their preinjury 
     sport. Subgroup analysis revealed variation in RTS based on sport 
     type, with the highest rate of return to preinjury performance found 
     in athletes in handball and sports with splits (fencing, squash, and 
     escalade; 100%) and soccer (95.2%). In the univariate analysis, male 
     sex (hazard ratio [HR], 4.05; 95% CI, 1.45-11.3; P = .008), higher 
     preinjury TAS score (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.52; P = .011), injury 
     involving the semimembranosus (HR, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.31-10.2; P < .001) 
     or conjoint tendon (HR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.55-6.25; P = .001), and PHTR 
     (HR, 7.77; 95% CI, 3.54-17.0; P < .001) were significantly associated 
     with a better postoperative level of competition. Multivariate 
     analysis identified 3 favorable predictors of RTS with HRs of 2.91 
     (95% CI, 1.01-8.35; P = .047) for male sex, 3.86 (95% CI, 1.78-8.37; 
     P < .001) for isolated semimembranosus injury, and 5.18 (95% CI, 
     2.24-12.0; P < .001) for PHTR. The complication rate was 4.7%. 
     Conclusion: Favorable predictors of early RTS were male sex, isolated 
     semimembranosus injury, and PHTR injuries.]

     AB: Abstract. Background: Despite similar published rates of 
     rerupture among patients treated with early functional rehabilitation 
     and open repair for acute Achilles tendon rupture, uncertainty still 
     exists regarding the optimal treatment modality. The reverse 
     fragility index (RFI) is a statistical tool that provides an 
     objective measure of the study's neutrality by determining the number 
     of events that need to change for a nonsignificant result to be 
     significant. Purpose: The purpose was to utilize the RFI to appraise 
     the strength of neutrality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
     comparing the rerupture rates of acute Achilles tendon ruptures 
     treated with open repair versus early functional rehabilitation. 
     Study. Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A 
     systematic review was performed including all RCTs comparing the 
     rerupture rates after operative repair and early functional 
     rehabilitation for acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Studies were 
     included that explicitly used early functional rehabilitation, 
     defined as weightbearing and exercise-based interventions initiated 
     within 2 weeks, as compared with open repair and reported a 
     nonsignificant difference in rerupture rates. The RFI, with rerupture 
     as the primary outcome, was calculated for each study (significance 
     threshold, P < .05). The RFI quantifies a study's strength of 
     neutrality and is defined as the minimum number of event reversals 
     necessary to change a nonsignificant result to statistically 
     significant. Results: Nine RCTs were included, with 713 patients and 
     46 reruptures. The median (interquartile range) rerupture rate was 
     7.69% (6.38%-9.64%) overall, 4.00% (2.33%-7.14%) in the operative 
     group, and 10.00% (5.26%-12.20%) in the nonoperative group. The 
     median RFI was 3, indicating that an outcome reversal of 3 patients 
     was necessary to change the results from nonsignificant to 
     statistically significant. The median number of patients lost to 
     follow-up was 6 (3-7). Of 9 studies, 7 (77.8%) had a loss to 
     follow-up greater than or equal to its RFI. Conclusion: The 
     statistical nonsignificance of studies reporting equivalent rerupture 
     rates in the management of acute Achilles tendon ruptures with open 
     repair versus nonoperative management with early functional 
     rehabilitation can be reversed by changing the outcome status of only 
     a few patients.]

     MD: AB]
     AB: Abstract. Background:. Hip arthroscopy has become the mainstay 
     surgical intervention for the treatment of femoroacetabular 
     impingement syndrome (FAIS). However, postoperative outcomes and 
     rates of secondary surgery are mixed in patients with differing 
     levels of preoperative osteoarthritis (OA). Furthermore, there is a 
     paucity of literature comparing patients with and without OA at 
     long-term follow-up. Purpose: To compare outcomes and rates of 
     secondary surgery at minimum 10-year follow-up, including revision 
     hip arthroscopy and conversion to total hip arthroplasty (THA), in 
     patients with Tönnis grade 1 undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAIS 
     compared with a propensity-matched control group of patients with 
     Tönnis grade 0. Study. Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. 
     Methods: Patients who underwent primary hip arthroscopy for FAIS 
     between January 2012 and February 2013 were identified. Patients with 
     Tönnis grade 1 were propensity matched in a 1:2 ratio by age, sex, 
     and body mass index (BMI) to patients with Tönnis grade 0. 
     Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were collected at varying timepoints 
     including preoperatively and 1, 2, 5, and 10 years postoperatively 
     and compared between the 2 cohorts. Rates of minimal clinically 
     important difference (MCID) and. Patient: Acceptable Symptom State 
     (PASS) achievement at 10 years were evaluated and compared between 
     groups. Rates of secondary surgery including revision hip arthroscopy 
     and conversion to total hip arthroplasty (THA) were evaluated. Gross 
     survivorship between cohorts was evaluated using a Kaplan-Meier gross 
     survivorship curve. A subanalysis was performed comparing patients 
     with Tönnis grade 1 who converted to THA and those who did not. 
     Results: A total of 31 patients with Tönnis grade 1 (age, 42.6 ± 
     9.0 years; BMI, 28.0 ± 6.3) were successfully matched to 62 patients 
     with Tönnis grade 0 (age, 42.1 ± 8.5, P = .805; BMI, 26.1 ± 3.9, P 
     = .117). Both the Tönnis grade 1 and Tönnis grade 0 groups 
     demonstrated significant improvements regarding all PROs at minimum 
     10 years (P < .05 for all), except for the Hip Outcome Score 
     Activities of Daily Living subscale (HOS-ADL) (P = .066) in the 
     Tönnis grade 1 cohort. No significant difference (P > .05 for all) 
     was noted between cohorts regarding any 10-year PRO. When the authors 
     evaluated comparisons between preoperative and 1-, 2-, 5-, and 
     10-year PRO measures, significant differences were noted between 
     cohorts regarding 2-year HOS-ADL (P = .021), Hip Outcome Score 
     Sports-Specific subscale (P = .016), and modified Harris Hip Score (P 
     = .026); otherwise, differences did not reach significance. High 
     rates of 10-year MCID and PASS achievement were seen, with no 
     significant differences between groups. Patients with Tönnis grade 1 
     had significantly higher rates of conversion to THA compared with 
     patients who had Tönnis grade 0 (25.8% vs 4.8%; P = .006). Patients 
     with Tönnis grade 1 had significantly lower gross survivorship 
     compared with those who had Tönnis grade 0 (71.0% vs 85.5%, 
     respectively; P = .04). Conclusion: Hip arthroscopy confers 
     comparable postoperative clinical improvements to patients who have 
     FAIS with and without mild OA; however, the benefits among patients 
     with mild OA may be less durable. Patients with Tönnis grade 1 had 
     significantly higher conversion to THA and reduced gross survivorship 
     compared with patients with no evidence of preoperative OA, 
     suggesting that patients with evidence of OA may need to be cautioned 
     on the higher rate of conversion surgery.]

     AB: Abstract. Background: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) 
     contribute to evaluating and improving the quality of patient care. 
     Patient outcomes after rotator cuff repair (RCR) have been 
     researched; however, the relationship between PROM response rates and 
     individual and health care correlates has not been thoroughly 
     investigated. Purpose: To examine differences in individual and 
     health care factors among patients who had undergone RCR based on 
     their PROM response rates. Study. Design: Case-control study; Level 
     of evidence, 3. Methods: Shoulder-specific and general PROMs were 
     solicited via email and text message of all patients who underwent 
     RCR between 2016 and 2020. Three subgroups were classified: (1) 
     complete responders completed all 1-year postoperative PROMs, (2) 
     partial responders answered enough questions to produce ≥1 usable 
     score, and (3) nonresponders did not respond to a single measure. 
     Correlates were assessed using analysis of variance and chi-square 
     tests. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression models identified 
     predictors of 1-year PROM response. Results: Of 2195 patients 
     included at the 1-year follow-up, 34% were complete responders; 11%, 
     partial responders; and 55%, nonresponders. Patients had a mean age 
     of 61.8 years, 63% were men, and 90% were White. Pre- and 
     postoperative PROM scores were similar across responder groups. In 
     stepwise selection, 1-year responses (complete or partial) were 
     associated with older age, later year of surgery, White race, and 
     having workers' compensation insurance. The strongest predictor of 
     PROM response was having workers' compensation insurance. Conclusion: 
     Patients with workers' compensation insurance compared with other 
     insurance types responded to PROMs at disproportionately higher 
     rates. This could distort postoperative PROM scores in the population 
     studied because there are known differences among patients with this 
     insurance status.]

     AB: Voices of people with lived experience led to a recovery-based 
     revolution in rehabilitation practices and principles. Hence, these 
     same voices must be included as partners in the research enterprise 
     meant to evaluate ongoing developments in this area. Community-based 
     participatory research (CBPR) is the one way to do this. CBPR is not 
     really new to the rehabilitation arena; Rogers and Palmer-Erbs 
     highlighted the paradigm shift in rehabilitation research calling for 
     participatory action research (PAR). PAR is action-oriented and 
     rooted in partnerships between people with lived experience, service 
     providers, and intervention researchers. This special section briefly 
     highlights important topics that highlight the continued need for 
     CBPR in our research enterprise.]

     AB: Objective: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is based 
     on power as fundamental to doing research. It evolved as a way of 
     "knowing" from the broader idea of natural science. While previously 
     viewed as objective, natural science is now understood as, at least, 
     partially socially constructed. Method: History of research and 
     epistemology is reviewed in terms of science. More specifically, we 
     delve into science as social construction and how this conceptually 
     opens the door to considering power in its processes. We then unpack 
     CBPR as one way to do mental health research that artfully weaves 
     power into method. Results: Natural science has evolved from 
     believing scientism (i.e. the scientific method) is sufficient to 
     describe physical and social phenomena to terms of social 
     constructivism; namely, the social processes that impact 
     investigators are necessary to understand science and its product. 
     This highlights the role of power; namely, investigator choices about 
     hypotheses, methods, analyses, and interpretations influence the 
     products of individual studies. The recovery movement is the 
     embodiment of power that significantly changed research and 
     rehabilitation in mental health. CBPR has emerged to include people 
     with lived experience in the research enterprise. CBPR is partnership 
     among people with lived experience, health scientists, and service 
     providers in all facets of doing research. Conclusions and 
     Implications for Practice: Integrating CBPR into rehabilitation 
     science has led to findings and actions that better serve community 
     objectives. Continuing to weave CBPR into research and development 
     will further enhance recovery in practice.]

     AB: Objective: This systematic review examined community-based 
     participatory research (CBPR) studies in which people with mental 
     illness (PWMI) directly contributed to research projects. The purpose 
     was to describe study characteristics, team structure and logistics, 
     and level of involvement of in the research process. Method: We 
     searched the PsycINFO database from January 2000 to July 2020, 
     identifying 1,395 records and analyzing the 31 that met inclusion 
     criteria. Articles were eligible if they were (a) published in 
     English in a peer-reviewed journal; (b) explicitly stated that at 
     least one adult with mental illness assisted with the study as a CBPR 
     team member; and (c) included a research outcome. Results: Most 
     studies collected qualitative data. Project length, team composition, 
     and frequency of meetings were not specified in about one third of 
     the articles. Twenty-nine studies reported involvement of people with 
     mental illness in research activities such as recruitment, data 
     collection, transcription, and analysis. Nearly half did not specify 
     if they received any training. Conclusions and Implications for 
     Practice: Individuals with mental illness were heavily involved in 
     planning and conducting research, demonstrating the feasibility of 
     meaningful involvement. Future research should consider how people 
     with lived experience can assist with quantitative methods, and 
     articles should clearly and explicitly describe characteristics of 
     the partnership (e.g. team composition, frequency of meetings, 
     compensation).]

     underserved minoritized ethnoracial groups. Methods: This article 
     examined the literature for relevant studies examining rates of 
     research engagement by minoritized ethnoracial groups, significant 
     factors precluding research engagement, and the consequences of this 
     disparity for mental health outcomes. The theoretical literature 
     outlining the development and utility of alternative, community-based 
     participatory research methods was included. Key features of CBPR 
     were examined along with limitations of current approaches. A case 
     study example of CBPR is provided. Results: The use of CBPR 
     approaches has been documented to improve health outcomes, reduce 
     stigma toward mental health research and treatment, and build the 
     professional capacity of community partners, particularly among 
     minoritized ethnoracial groups. Conclusions and Implications for 
     Practice: CBPR engagement practices are a means of reducing the 
     mental health research gap for ethnic and racial minoritized groups. 
     The use of such approaches in future research and practice will 
     directly inform how existing psychological treatments may be modified 
     per the needs of the patient, address long standing issues of 
     cultural mistrust toward professional institutions, and reduce mental 
     health stigma in underserved communities.]

     AB: Objective: Including people most impacted by a challenge in 
     designing and implementing solutions to that challenge has reemerged 
     in social science research. In prison settings, academics' outside 
     knowledge of "what works" combined with incarcerated people's inside 
     knowledge of lived experience could lead to more comprehensive 
     rehabilitative programs. This combined approach may make less sense 
     as an intervention in prison, however, due to sensitive and 
     complicated interpersonal dynamics. We determine if incarcerated 
     women perceive prison programs as more efficacious when other 
     incarcerated women are collaboratively involved in the design and 
     implementation of those programs, as compared to other program 
     delivery methods. Methods: We employ a participatory action research 
     framework in administering a randomized vignette to 200 incarcerated 
     women. We randomize who designs and teaches a prison program in a 
     hypothetical scenario, with incarcerated women alongside university 
     researchers the key combined condition of interest. We then ask a 
     series of questions regarding incarcerated women's perception of the 
     program's efficacy. Results: Women who received the combined 
     condition were four times more likely to view the program as 
     legitimate when compared to programs taught by correctional staff. 
     The combined condition was not significantly different on legitimacy 
     when compared to either researchers alone or incarcerated women 
     alone. We did not observe other expected relationships between the 
     combined condition and perceived program efficacy. Conclusions and 
     Implications for Practice: Researcher and incarcerated person-led 
     programming should be implemented carefully in institutional settings 
     to leverage the value of lived experience while avoiding creating 
     further harm for confined people.]

     AB: Objective: Supported education (SEd) provides individualized 
     support to people with mental health problems to achieve their 
     educational goals. Individual placement and support (IPS) has emerged 
     as a model through which SEd may be efficiently delivered. However, 
     the components and characteristics of educational support for these 
     employment-focused services have not been fully explored. Building on 
     earlier studies, we constructed a preliminary model of SEd components 
     that integrated with the IPS model. The SEd model included the eight 
     original principles of IPS, developed to reflect the SEd component, 
     and two new principles were suggested. The aim of the study is to 
     investigate these adapted principles by exploring the feasibility of 
     applying them within established IPS programs providing both 
     employment and educational services. Methods: An organizational 
     learning approach was taken, involving five IPS programs providing 
     both employment and educational services to young adults with mental 
     health problems. Data were collected through focus groups, 
     interviews, and workshops with 19 IPS specialists. Results: The 
     results suggest that while the IPS principles provide a feasible and 
     relevant structure for the development and provision of integrated 
     services, adaptations that reflect the educational context were 
     considered valuable when supporting young adults in pursuing their 
     career-related goals. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The 
     respondents confirmed that the SEd principles and the focus on 
     support in educational contexts helped them to further develop their 
     knowledge and strategies. While challenging, integrating SEd in IPS 
     models shows good potential for supporting young adults as they 
     struggle to reach longer term career-oriented goals.]

     AB: Objective: Many young adults who are unemployed and not in school 
     need support achieving employment goals. Individual Placement and 
     Support (IPS) is an evidence-based employment practice for adults 
     with serious mental illness, but its applicability to young adults 
     with mental health conditions has not been well-researched. The 
     present study prospectively assessed IPS effectiveness in a national 
     sample of young adults enrolled in routine practice settings in the 
     U.S. public mental health system. Method: Nine community agencies in 
     five states participated in a 1-year follow-up study of young adults 
     (aged 16−24) enrolled in IPS services. The study examined three 
     outcomes: retention in services, employment, and education. State 
     fidelity reviewers examined IPS fidelity using a new fidelity scale, 
     the IPS-Y. Results: In a sample of 111 participants, the mean age was 
     19.2, 72 (64.9%) had never worked, and 76 (68.5%) had a diagnosis of 
     depressive and/or anxiety disorder. Participants averaged 8 months of 
     enrollment before terminating from IPS services. During follow-up, 51 
     (45.9%) participants obtained a competitive job (N = 50) or paid 
     internship (N = 1); 14 (12.6%) achieved a new education outcome. 
     Conclusions and Implications for Practice: IPS has promising outcomes 
     for helping young adults with mental health conditions achieve 
     positive employment outcomes, but its effectiveness in helping young 
     adults achieve education goals has not been demonstrated. IPS should 
     be offered to young adults with employment goals. Targeted funding 
     for supported education and training for IPS specialists in 
     delivering educational supports may be necessary to ensure optimal 
     education outcomes in IPS.]

     9.65; SD = 4.92). Secondary outcomes: At follow-up, 73.1% 
     participants were employed, working on average more hours per week, 
     t(25) = −2.725; p = .012, and were earning significantly more 
     money, t(25) = −3.702; p = .001, compared to baseline. Gains in 
     educational outcomes were less clear. Global Assessment of 
     Functioning, t = 248.50; p = .001, and Social Occupational 
     Functioning, t(25) = −3.273; p = .003, were significantly higher at 
     6-month follow-up compared to baseline. No differences were found in 
     participants' self-efficacy. Conclusions and Implications for 
     Practice: Findings indicate that research procedures are appropriate 
     and that IPS implementation within a CHR clinical team is feasible. 
     Secondary outcomes also suggest that IPS may be a beneficial 
     intervention for young people at CHR. A longer follow-up might be 
     needed to assess its impact on educational outcomes.]

     AB: Objective: Different predictors of job tenure for people with a 
     severe mental illness (SMI) have been documented. Conflicting results 
     may be explained by the choice of indicators to measure job tenure. 
     This study aimed to assess the contribution of employment specialist 
     competencies working in supported employment programs, client 
     variables, and work accommodations, in determining job tenure in the 
     regular labor market. Method: A longitudinal study was conducted over 
     6 months, including people with SMI (n = 209) registered in 24 
     Canadian supported employment programs. Multivariable modeling 
     analyses were performed. Results: Overall, 67% (n = 140) of the 
     sample were employed at the 6-month follow-up. Multilevel analyses 
     showed that shorter duration of unemployment (i.e. the number of 
     weeks worked), employment specialist knowledge, and working alliance 
     were the strongest predictors of job tenure for people with SMI. With 
     respect to the number of hours worked per week, diagnosis, executive 
     functions, social functioning, work accommodations, and employment 
     specialist skills were the strongest predictors of job tenure for 
     people with SMI, with 57% of variance explained. Conclusions and 
     Implications for Practice: Understanding the various predictors of 
     job tenure can assist employment specialists in providing better 
     interventions for the work integration of people with SMI.]

     and pre- and postassessment of a mental illness awareness webinar. 
     The goal of the webinar is to educate the general public about 
     serious mental illness (SMI) and reduce stigmatizing attitudes. 
     Method: The study included 203 participants (n = 101 treatment group; 
     n = 102 control group). Each completed a pretest and posttest measure 
     of a mental illness stigma scale and a transphobia scale in this 
     randomized control trial research design, along with a demographic 
     form and participant feedback questionnaire. Results: Results 
     revealed that stigma was significantly reduced from pretest to 
     posttest depending on group condition. Participant feedback reflected 
     generally positive responses to the benefits of participating in the 
     webinar in terms of feeling more knowledgeable about SMI in 
     particular (75.5%). Furthermore, while prior contact with people 
     with-and prior education about-SMI alone did not appear to 
     significantly impact stigma scores from pre- to posttest, these 
     variables did appear to have a significant interaction in their 
     combined impact on stigma scores. Conclusions and Implications for 
     Practice: Findings suggest that the mental illness awareness training 
     holds promise as an effective tool or reducing stigma among members 
     of the general public. The electronic nature of the webinar allows 
     for widespread and cost-effective dissemination and can also be 
     tailored to meet the needs of specific populations such as law 
     enforcement, first responders, and veterans to destigmatize SMI and 
     improve treatment seeking.]

     tools. Method: This study examines the psychometric properties of the 
     Chinese versions of the Vocational Cognitive Rating Scale (VCRS) and 
     the Work Behavior Inventory (WBI) in 60 chronic patients from a 
     psychiatric daycare center and identifies clinical correlates of 
     occupational function measured on the Positive and Negative Syndrome 
     Scale (PANSS). Results: The Chinese VCRS and WBI showed adequate 
     internal consistency, interrater and test-retest reliability, and 
     good convergent validity with the Comprehensive Occupational Therapy 
     Evaluation Scale. Factor analysis favored a one-factor solution of 
     the VCRS; and a four-factor structure in the WBI including 
     Efficiency, Social Interaction, Appropriateness, and Regularity. The 
     VCRS and Efficiency were predicted by fewer disorganization but 
     greater affective symptoms. Social Interaction was negatively 
     predicted by resistance symptoms. Appropriateness was associated with 
     all but negative symptoms. Regularity was predicted by fewer negative 
     symptoms. Considering work behavior altogether, WBI total scores were 
     predicted by fewer negative, fewer disorganization, and greater 
     affective symptoms. Conclusions and Implication for Practice: 
     Findings suggest that the Chinese VCRS and WBI have sound 
     psychometric properties and are suitable for both clinical trials and 
     for planning personalized rehabilitation programs.]

     AB: Hockey players must have good coordination skills, agility, and 
     control of their body movements. The main movement pattern is the 
     skating, which consists of a support and a swing phase. Those who 
     skate effectively can reach speeds up to 48 km/h. Traumatic injuries 
     predominate in hockey, with medial collateral ligament injury being 
     the most common injury in both genders (44/1,000 h). Overuse injuries 
     account for a smaller proportion of injuries, with the hip joint 
     being the most affected area. One of the most important internal risk 
     factors is a previous injury. External risk factors relate to the 
     level of play, player position, and the characteristics of the game. 
     Repetitive skating patterns can cause femoroacetabular impingement 
     syndrome. Inadequate skating technique results in a knee valgus 
     position, which can damage the medial collateral ligament. Rapid 
     changes of direction cause an injury of the hip adductor muscles. 
     Torsional forces in the ankle during skating can lead to high ankle 
     fractures, and shear forces between the tendons and the stiff tongue 
     of the skate can lead to tendon inflammation. Prevention activities 
     should include strengthening of the hip, knee and shoulder girdle 
     muscles, and sport-specific exercises early in the season. At the end 
     of the article, rehabilitation strategies for specific injuries are 
     also discussed.]

     AB: Decreased quality and duration of sleep can impact both physical 
     and mental health in addition to quality of life, well-being, quality 
     of social relationships, productivity, and performance. With insomnia 
     as a leading sleep disorder among menopausal-aged women, identifying 
     low-cost and low-risk interventions is important for maintaining 
     physical and mental health. One promising intervention is cognitive 
     behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). The objective of this review 
     was to describe the effectiveness of CBT-I in decreasing insomnia 
     symptoms in menopausal-aged women. Electronic databases were searched 
     using terms encompassing insomnia, CBT-I, and menopausal age. Seven 
     articles met the inclusion criteria of using a CBT-I strategy in 
     women of menopausal or post-menopausal age and measuring at least one 
     sleep-related outcome. Studies primarily used sleep restriction, 
     stimulus control, and sleep hygiene education techniques. 
     Interventions were delivered in both face-to-face and telehealth 
     formats. Across studies, insomnia symptoms and sleep quality improved 
     with moderate to large effect sizes and clinically significant 
     changes were achieved in most studies. Quality of life and mental 
     health were improved in studies measuring those outcomes. 
     Effectiveness did not appear to vary between delivery methods. Based 
     on this review, we can state that CBT-I is a practical and effective 
     intervention for menopausal-aged women experiencing insomnia, 
     providing clinically meaningful reductions in insomnia symptoms and 
     improvements in sleep quality, quality of life, and mental health. 
     Future research would benefit from more detailed analyses of the 
     different techniques and dosing. Additionally, new technology, 
     including sleep trackers and personalized care using AI-driven 
     programming, should be investigated.]

     of the children, parents and healthcare providers. Design: A 
     qualitative case study method using semistructured interviews was 
     employed with a within-case and across-case analysis. Themes and 
     subthemes emerging from the cases were compared and contrasted in the 
     across-case analysis to explore the similarities and variations in 
     participant perceptions. Setting/participants The setting was the 
     paediatric departments of five regional hospitals in Hong Kong. 
     Twenty-five sets of informants (CLLC-parent-healthcare provider) were 
     recruited, with 65 individual interviews conducted. Results: A total 
     of 3784 units of analysis were identified, resulting in three themes 
     with subthemes. 'Living with the disease' (55.8%) occupied the 
     largest proportion, followed by 'information and understanding about 
     the disease' (27.4%), and 'care support and palliative care' (16.8%). 
     Healthcare provider support mainly focused on physical concerns. 
     Family and social support were present, but carer stress created 
     tension between couples. Doctors were the primary source of medical 
     information, but the parents had to seek further information via the 
     internet and support from patient groups. There was a perceived need 
     for better coordination and collaboration of care. The palliative 
     care approach coordinated by nurses was seen as helpful in addressing 
     the care needs of the CLLC. Conclusions: This original study 
     identified the importance of palliative care with active engagement 
     of parents which can address the service gap for CLLC.]

     AB: Polypharmacy is becoming increasingly troublesome in the 
     treatment of cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the effects 
     of concomitant polypharmacy comprising drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 
     and/or CYP2D6 on the oxycodone tolerability in patients with cancer. 
     We conducted a multicenter retrospective study encompassing 20 
     hospitals. The data used for the study were obtained during the first 
     2 wk of oxycodone administration. The incidence of oxycodone 
     discontinuation or dose reductions due to side effects and 
     oxycodone-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV) were compared between 
     patients not treated with either inhibitor and those treated with 
     concomitant CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. The incidence of oxycodone 
     discontinuation or dose reductions in patients treated with ≥3 
     concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitors (18.2%) tended to be higher than that 
     in patients without this treatment (8.2%; p = 0.09). Moreover, the 
     incidence of OINV in patients treated with 2 concomitant CYP3A4 
     inhibitors (29.8%) was significantly higher than that in patients 
     without this treatment (15.5%; p = 0.049). Multivariate analysis 
     showed that more than two concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors and no 
     concomitant use of naldemedine were independent risk factors for 
     OINV. Concomitant polypharmacy involving CYP3A4 inhibitors increases 
     the risk of OINV. Therefore, medications concomitantly used with 
     oxycodone should be optimized.]

     observational cohort study was conducted at an academic medical 
     center to evaluate low-dose naltrexone (LDN) efficacy and describe 
     its use in routine clinical practice. Adults receiving LDN, doses <10 
     mg for ≥1 month, seen at an outpatient pain clinic from January 1, 
     2014 to April 1, 2022 were included. The primary outcome was change 
     in the Pain, Enjoyment of Life, and General Activity (PEG) score 
     after LDN. Thirty-one patients were included. Median age was 50 years 
     and 71% were female. Median duration of pain at baseline was 5 years. 
     Mean PEG scores were 7.27 ± 1.39 and 6.62 ± 2.04 at baseline and 
     follow-up, respectively. Mean difference was 0.66 (95% CI 
     [0.10-1.21], p = 0.022). Eighty-seven percent (27) of patients 
     discontinued LDN, 52% (16) for lack of benefit, 23% (7) for loss of 
     benefit, 10% (3) for side effects, and 3% (1) for other reasons. 
     Seven (23%) reported side effects. LDN was associated with a 
     statistically significant reduction in PEG in adult chronic pain 
     patients, however the clinical significance is unclear as over 75% of 
     patients discontinued LDN due to lack of benefit.]

     AB: Treating palliative cancer patients with antithrombotics is 
     challenging because of the higher risk for both venous 
     thromboembolism and major bleeding. There is a lack of available 
     guidelines on deprescribing potentially inappropriate 
     antithrombotics. We have therefore created an antithrombotics scheme 
     to aid in (de)prescribing antithrombotics. A retrospective 
     single-center clinical cohort observational study was performed to 
     evaluate it. Patients with solid tumors with a life expectancy of 
     less than 3 months seen by the palliative team were included. 
     Comparisons were made between patients who were treated according to 
     the antithrombotics scheme and those who were not. 47.6% of patients 
     used antithrombotics. One hundred and eleven patients were included 
     for analysis. Most patients used antithrombotics according to the 
     scheme (n = 80, 72.1%). Eleven patients experienced a clinical event, 
     seven patients in the scheme adherence group (9.9%) and four in the 
     no scheme adherence group (13.8%), which was not statistically 
     significant (p = 0.726). The higher frequency of clinical events in 
     the group without scheme adherence suggests that (de)prescribing 
     antithrombotics according to the antithrombotics scheme is safe. The 
     results of this study suggest that the antithrombotics scheme could 
     aid healthcare professionals identifying possible inappropriate 
     antithrombotics in palliative cancer patients. Further prospective 
     research is needed to investigate this tool.]

     AB: Intractable nausea can occur in numerous settings. We report on a 
     49-year-old woman with a past medical history of cystic fibrosis (CF) 
     with chronic hypoxia, chronic nausea, complex infection history and 
     frequent hospitalizations who was admitted to an academic medical 
     center with a CF exacerbation. Her chronic nausea worsened with the 
     use of antimicrobials, and she was unable to tolerate dopamine or 
     serotonin antagonist antiemetics. Nausea persisted despite the use of 
     benzodiazepines and antihistamines. She was given a one-time dose of 
     fosaprepitant 150 mg intravenously (IV) with marked improvement of 
     her nausea. During subsequent exacerbations, she again developed 
     severe nausea which continued to respond well to a one-time dose of 
     fosaprepitant 150 mg IV. Fosaprepitant is a substance P/neurokinin-1

     AB: QT prolongation is related to the development of ventricular 
     arrhythmias such as Torsade de Pointes (TdP) that can lead to sudden 
     cardiac death. Several drugs used in the treatment of patients with 
     advanced cancer may induce QT prolongation due to their interference 
     with cardiac ion channels. Some patients may be at higher risk if 
     predisposing factors are present. Herein we present the case of a 
     patient with advanced cancer under anti-tumor treatment with radical 
     intention that developed a reversible drug-induced QT prolongation 
     when simultaneously treated with methadone, haloperidol and 
     fluoxetine that presented with chest pain and bradycardia. An 
     approach to cancer patients at risk for drug-induced QT prolongation 
     is discussed highlighting the need of a thorough medication review 
     with a special focus in the patient with polypharmacy.]

     AB: Symptoms of nausea and vomiting are common in palliative care and 
     hospice patients. One of the many classes of medications used for the 
     treatment of nausea and vomiting is dopamine receptor antagonists 
     which are particularly helpful for treating nausea mediated by the 
     chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and impaired gastrointestinal 
     function. While dopamine antagonists can be very effective treatments 
     for nausea they should be used with caution as they carry the risk of 
     QTc prolongation, have a FDA black box warning for tardive dyskinesia 
     (TD), and increased risk of precipitating psychosis and death in 
     patients with dementia. This review will cover haloperidol, 
     olanzapine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide for treatment of 
     nausea and vomiting including evidence of efficacy, pharmacokinetics, 
     and pharmacodynamics to improve safe and effective utilization in 
     clinical practice. This includes medication receptor site affinities 
     at histaminic, muscarinic, serotonergic, and alpha-adrenergic 
     receptors which can help providers anticipate potential adverse 
     effects and risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), TD, and QTc 
     prolongation. This review also includes considerations for dose 
     adjustments based on renal function, hepatic function, and age. 
     Understanding the pharmacology of dopamine antagonists can help 
     providers choose the best treatment for control of nausea and 
     vomiting and subsequently improve patients' quality of life.]

     AB: Chronic pain in children continues to pose significant 
     challenges. The pharmacological approach most often revolves around 
     trials and errors, expert opinions, and extrapolation of adult study 
     findings. Ketamine is one of the agents used for chronic pain, 
     especially with a neuropathic component. This article aims to provide 
     an overview of its properties and highlight the current evidence for 
     its use in malignant and nonmalignant chronic pain management. A 
     search on the use of ketamine for chronic pain in children up to 18 
     years of age covering the period from January 1, 2000, to December 
     14, 2022, was performed through PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, EBM 
     Review, Wiley, BMJ, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Saudi 
     Digital Library. 218 articles were found and 42 underwent full 
     review. Currently, the evidence about ketamine efficacity and safety 
     for chronic pain management is at best of moderate to low quality. 
     The heterogeinity of ketamine infusion protocols and frequent 
     concomitant use of other analgesics make it difficult to draw robust 
     conclusions. The long-term effect of prolonged usage also remains a 
     concern. Nevertheless, with careful monitoring, the drug may be a 
     reasonable choice for malignant and nonmalignant pain management in 
     selected cases, especially for refractory pain not responding to 
     conventional approaches.]

     AB: A retrospective, cohort, single center, chart review was 
     conducted to compare rates of opioid-associated serious adverse 
     events (SAEs) in a patient cohort 6 months before and 6 months after 
     data-based opioid risk review. The primary objective was the 
     composite reduction in opioid-related SAEs including suicide-related 
     events and opioid overdoses. The impact of the reviews was assessed 
     via multivariate logistic regression and a McNemar's test to analyze 
     difference in rates of opioid-associated SAEs. This study 
     demonstrates that data-based opioid risk review can reduce 
     opioid-related SAEs, opioid overdoses, and suicide-related events in 
     the 6 months post-review. The primary outcome was not statistically 
     significant with a p-value of 0.080. In the population that underwent 
     opioid tapers, the hazard ratios (HR) for suicide-related events and 
     opioid-related SAEs were 6.64 (1.09-40.53, p = 0.05) and 10.43 
     (0.48-226.80, p = 0.02) respectively when compared to non-tapered 
     patients. The HR for suicide-related events and opioid-related SAEs 
     when opioid therapy was discontinued were 9.95 (2.16-45.94, p = 
     0.009) and 15.64 (1.09-225.19, p = 0.001) respectively when compared 
     to continuation of opioids. This study showed that data-based opioid 
     risk review may reduce incidence of opioid-related SAEs in patients 
     with chronic pain. Additionally, opioid tapers and discontinuations 
     are significant risk factors for suicide-related events and 
     opioid-related SAEs.]

     AB: Critical thinking is the process of analyzing and evaluating 
     thinking to make decisions. Critical thinking exposes assumptions, 
     biases, and beliefs that influence clinical reasoning. This scoping 
     review sought to explore instructional approaches for advancing 
     students' critical thinking in healthcare education. Through analysis 
     of 15 articles, no common definition of critical thinking emerged, 
     nor consensus found on measurement or instructional methods. Some 
     alternative instructional methods such as case-based learning, 
     reflective guided questions, and multiple case exposures, when 
     compared to lecture, did significantly impact learner critical 
     thinking. To determine if critical thinking is an instructional 
     method that would impact implicit biases and healthcare outcomes, 
     five author recommendations are offered from gaps in the existing 
     literature to provide a pathway for future research. To effectively 
     prepare students for clinical practice, long term outcomes are 
     necessary to assess if critical thinking skills can be taught and

     AB: Social prescribing is a process of helping people to access 
     non-medical activities and services which address health and 
     wellbeing needs. The process is frequently (although not exclusively) 
     initiated by primary health care professionals and often involves 
     prescribing activities or initiatives provided by community and 
     voluntary organizations. To occupational therapy, the links between 
     activity, social-connectedness and health are clearly not new, 
     although there are emerging international examples of social 
     prescribing initiatives, and examples of newly developed roles, 
     processes and funding opportunities, all of which are creating 
     momentum behind the agenda. In this commentary, we draw upon the 
     theory of Institutional Work to examine how the language of 
     "prescription," and the purposive action of policy-makers and 
     practitioners, is shaping thinking and action in relation to activity 
     and health. Arguably, this language has helped to translate the 
     recommendation of activity to meet a range of health needs in to an 
     accessible and implementable concept. However, it has also 
     potentially contributed to positioning the concept within a medical 
     model of health, upholding medical dominance, and leaving 
     occupational therapy on the margins of the debate.]

     intervention toward its hoped-for ending. Narrative reasoning was 
     particularly apparent in opportunities to reflect aloud, supporting 
     occupational therapists' need of opportunities for reflection through 
     story-sharing and story-making. Case study and ethnographic research 
     methodologies may be useful in further clinical reasoning research to 
     better understand narrative reasoning.]

     conducted of research studies from 2002 − 2020 describing novice 
     occupational therapy practitioners and occupation. Ten articles met

     was a source of professional tension, describing a mismatch between 
     their education and workplace expectations. The cognitive load of 
     occupation-centered practice influenced novices' avoidance of

     AB: To identify variables that contribute to fall risk in older 
     adults, this study examined the relationship between fall risk, 
     sensory processing, participation in daily activities, and quality of 
     life (QoL). Of the 123 participants, those at high-risk were 
     significantly less able to register sensory input and had increased 
     sensory sensitivity, restricted participation and overall lower QoL. 
     Altered sensory processing was related with risk of falling. 
     Additionally, both sensory process and fall risk were subsequently 
     related with lower daily participation and, together, were related 
     with lower QoL. Thus, sensory processing, participation and QoL 
     assessments need to be included in occupational therapy evaluations 
     and interventions for fall risk among older adults.]

     psychometric properties of the TeleWrite, a handwriting assessment 
     tool designed to measure the rate, accuracy, and fluency of 
     children's handwriting for children in first through third grade 
     administered via telehealth. A series of three pilot studies were 
     completed to determine initial interrater reliability, content 
     validity, and clinical utility of the TeleWrite. A study with eight 
     children was used to determine preliminary interrater reliability 
     testing using a beta version of the TeleWrite with (n = 9) raters. 
     The reliability coefficient was obtained using intraclass correlation 
     (ICC) and yielded α = 0.92 for total scores, CI [0.815, 0.983] and 
     the Cronbach's α measure for internal consistency was α = 0.95 
     (excellent). A clinical utility survey of (n = 55) pediatric 
     occupational therapists was used to obtain their clinical impression 
     regarding the usefulness and accuracy. Representing twelve different 
     countries and twenty-two U.S. states, the respondents indicated that 
     61% (n = 33) are quite or extremely likely to use the TeleWrite in 
     their practice and most participants (64%; n = 35) indicated that 
     TeleWrite was quite/extremely accurate in measuring handwriting 
     performance. Third, a content validity study with nine handwriting 
     experts reviewed and concluded that all ten subtests of the TeleWrite 
     tool are considered essential. All preliminary studies strengthen the 
     development of the TeleWrite assessment to advance to construct 
     validation of the tool.]

     participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group 
     (client-centered occupational therapy) and a control group (general 
     occupational therapy). A pretest, post-test, and follow-up tests were 
     used to compare the effects of the intervention. The experimental 
     group had significant changes in all variables, and the control group 
     showed significant differences in verbal social interaction, quality 
     of life, and burden of caregivers (p < 0.05). As a result of repeated 
     measurement variance analysis, it was found that there was a 
     significant effect within the group except for the NPI-Q distress 
     items (p < 0.05), but the effect was not verified in all areas

     was conducted, and the Pearson's correlation coefficient was utilized 
     to determine the correlation among variables. Most respondents 
     (68.9%) reported moderate to severe burden on the ZBIS. Across age 
     groups, statistically significant, negative correlations were found 
     between burden and physical health (r = −0.371, p < 0.001), social 
     relationships (r = −0.389, p < 0.001), psychological health (r = 
     −0.445, p < 0.001) and environment (r = −0.438, p < 0.001). 
     Mothers of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes reported an 
     inverse relationship between burden and quality of life influenced by 
     the occupation of caregiving. Occupational therapy practitioners can 
     address strategies to reduce caregiver burden and improve mothers' 
     quality of life.]

     activity self-efficacy emerged: 1) physical activity engagement, 2) 
     self-management behaviors, 3) physical activity determinants, 4) 
     strategies, and 5) self-perceived benefits. These themes were 
     analyzed to produce a preliminary model describing the development of 
     physical activity self-efficacy in older adults with age-related

     were also completed at two months. Reported improvements in reading 
     performance and satisfaction levels on the Reading Behavior Inventory 
     were significant (p<.001). The Revised-Self-Report Assessment of 
     Functional Visual Performance indicated improved independence in 
     reading medications, bills and labels. Higher scores in happiness, 
     independence, sense of control and adaptability on the Psychosocial 
     Impact of Assistive Devices Scale-10 indicated device retention at 
     two months. Qualitative themes included improved independence, time 
     needed to acclimate to the device, personal appraisal impacting

     patients' likelihood to receive an occupational therapy evaluation or 
     specific types of occupational therapy interventions in the NCCU. 
     When compared to patients without arousal deficits, patients who were 
     experiencing agitation or light sedation, but not deep sedation, were 
     more likely to receive occupational therapy interventions in the 
     therapeutic activities category. Arousal deficits were not associated 
     with receipt of occupational therapy services or occupational therapy 
     interventions in the self-care or therapeutic exercise categories. 
     Determining predictors of occupational therapy services will help

     Four occupational therapists were recruited to rate a videotaped 
     performance of a simulated patient. Resulting inter-rater reliability 
     inter-class coefficients (ICC) are good, ICC = .877, p < .01,

     AB: Introduction. This scoping review explores the professional 
     literature in allied healthcare to determine which self-assessments 
     of mentor skills are the most valid and reliable for use in 
     occupational therapy doctoral capstone programs. The aims of this 
     scoping review include mapping evidence related to mentor assessments 
     in healthcare, exploring implications for occupational therapy 
     doctoral mentor training programs, and identifying common 
     characteristics of mentor self-assessments for occupational therapy 
     programs to consider when developing capstone mentoring resources. 
     Methods. Researchers applied and reported via PRISMA Extension for 
     Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A librarian and authors formulated 
     keywords and database selections to search PubMed/MEDLINE/PMC, and 
     Embase were searched from across healthcare professions for training 
     outcomes, mentor self-assessment, mentor attributes, and use of 
     researcher-developed assessments. The search was limited to English 
     publications from the last 20 years. Data were extracted for 
     quantitative information regarding study characteristics and 
     qualitative information about mentoring skills. Results. A total of 
     852 results were delivered across all databases. Nineteen papers met 
     the final eligibility criteria and were included in the data 
     extraction. Populations were included from several healthcare 
     professions, including 11 nursing, four healthcare researchers, one 
     pharmacy, one midwifery, one medicine, and one medical dietetics. 
     Countries included the United States (n = 7), Finland (n = 5), United 
     Kingdom (n = 4), Japan (n = 1), South Africa (n = 1) and Canada (n = 
     1). Conclusion. The authors identified four valid self-assessment 
     tools, demonstrating III and IV levels of evidence, that may be 
     implemented by occupational therapy programs as they develop 
     resources for mentor programs. Occupational therapy programs can use 
     the mentor attributes found in this scoping review to create their 
     own mentor assessment measures or may choose to use a validated tool. 
     The authors recommend additional research in mentor education and 
     mentor skill acquisition.]

     AB: Occupational therapy is beneficial among adults with chronic 
     pain; however, occupational therapy interventions addressing earlier 
     phases of pain have not been clearly explicated. This systematic 
     review characterized acute and subacute interventions billable by 
     occupational therapy after hip or knee replacement to improve pain 
     and function. Seven articles met inclusion criteria. Six articles had 
     a low risk of bias. Three intervention types were found: 
     task-oriented exercise, water-based, and modalities. Only 
     task-oriented interventions improved both pain and function one-year 
     after surgery. There are long-term benefits to early task-oriented 
     exercise. Further research is needed to contextualize occupational 
     therapy's role in early pain interventions.]

     occupational therapy home assessments. Searches of ProQuest Health 
     and Medicine, PubMed and CINAHL accessed articles from January 2001 
     to 18 April 2021. Based on the screening and eligibility criteria, 10 
     articles published in English were included in the review. Three 
     primary types of studies were identified: the feasibility of using 
     telehealth technology to conduct home assessments; the efficiency of 
     using telehealth technology to perform home assessments; and patient 
     and therapist satisfaction using telehealth technology. This review 
     ascertained that occupational therapy home assessments can be 
     performed using telehealth technology, they are an efficient 
     alternative to in-person assessments, and home assessments conducted 
     via telehealth can be effective in achieving patient outcomes. 
     Satisfaction with the use of telehealth, as an alternative service 
     delivery model, has been identified by both patients and occupational 
     therapists. The use of telehealth technology can increase the 
     capacity of the occupational therapy profession to carry out home 
     assessments although in-person home assessment is more accurate in 
     detecting hazards in the home.]

     AB: Many older people experience everyday memory complaints which can 
     be a precursor condition to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. 
     Research has consistently shown that compensatory cognitive training 
     (CCT) benefits cognition in older adults. Providing CCT in a 
     computerized format makes it more accessible and reduces its costs. 
     We studied a newly developed digital CCT for older adults with 
     everyday memory complaints that is multi-factorial and based on 
     empirically supported techniques to improve memory. 55 older adults 
     with self-reported everyday memory complaints participated in a study 
     with outcomes assessed at baseline and post-intervention. We found 
     that participants in the experimental condition improved 
     significantly on the main objective outcome measure assessing 
     associative memory compared to participants in a waitlist control 
     condition. Specifically, after correcting for learning effects, 28% 
     of participants in the experimental condition showed a reliable 
     improvement. No effects were found on other objective outcome 
     measures, most notably those assessing transfer to novel tasks. 
     Participants in the experimental condition scored higher on measures 
     of memory satisfaction, use of internal memory strategies, and 
     quality of life. These findings contribute to existing knowledge on 
     CCT by providing partial evidence for the efficacy of a digital CCT 
     for older adults with everyday memory complaints. We recommend the 
     use of digital CCT for older adults who experience memory complaints 
     in their everyday life, but who do not qualify for medical treatment. 
     Particular attention needs to be given to enhancing transfer of the 
     learned strategies to everyday life.]

     non-pharmacological approach in older persons living with Alzheimer's 
     disease (AD) to improve both cognitive and behavioral and 
     psychological symptoms that accompany the disease. Our main aim was

     effectiveness of different approaches using AT in older people living 
     with AD. The systematic analysis of the studies finally selected (n =

     of AT may not always be the most appropriate to assess the impact of 
     this approach in this type of population, in many cases not being 
     sufficiently sensitive to adequately capture all the significant 
     changes produced by the intervention. Neurologically informed AT, as 
     well as the use of biomarkers, could better identify and capture

     AB: Despite the importance and prevalence in the use of the term 
     "aging well," there has been an absence of an empirically valid aging 
     well model for conceptualization and measurement of the phenomenon. 
     The purpose of the study was to conceptualize and test a model for 
     aging well. A sample of 554 non-institutionalized individuals was 
     taken using primary sampling units (PSUs), and a higher-order 
     confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to test a model for aging 
     well. This study confirmed a five-factor structure of aging well, 
     including (a) daily life activity, (b) social resources and supports, 
     (c) mental efficacy, (d) physical health and functional status, and 
     (e) material security. Although all five dimensions strongly 
     contribute to the aging well construct, the statistical results have 
     shown that Social Resources and Support (SRS) and Daily Life Activity 
     are the most important in explaining aging well. Material Security is

     AB: To promote health and healthy aging, it is important to develop 
     supportive environments and specific opportunities for meaningful and 
     valuable social engagement. The current study examined the 
     differences of Body Mass Index (physical health indicator), perceived 
     health, happiness, and depression (mental health indicators) 
     according to the clusters of leisure participation patterns among 
     older adults who were retired and living in the community. A sample 
     of 1,134 participants aged 60 years and older was extracted from the 
     Alameda County Health and Ways of Living Study. The result of K-means 
     cluster analysis revealed that there were three distinctive leisure 
     participation patterns: the ardent achievers, the physical 
     enthusiasts, and the easy contenders. The multivariate analysis of 
     covariance (MANCOVA) showed that the ardent achievers had the highest 
     perceived mental health and happiness scores and the lowest 
     depressive symptoms scores. Physical enthusiasts demonstrated the 
     highest scores on 'working in the garden' and the lowest Body Mass 
     Index of the three groups, which is one of the important indicators 
     for physical health. Activity professionals may encourage older 
     adults living in the community to work in the garden or other 
     moderate to rigorous physical exercise, which may contribute to 
     increased physical and mental health of older adults. Further 
     practical implications are discussed.]

     creative activities. It was introduced into UK care homes to address 
     evidence suggesting older adults who live with dementia in care homes 
     can experience diminished personal wellbeing. This study aimed to 1) 
     assess the impact of HenPower on people who have dementia who are 
     living in a care home and 2) explore care home staff views and 
     experiences of the HenPower programme. A nested qualitative design 
     was adopted, utilizing observation of 29 older people who live in a 
     care home and 25 staff individual and small-group interviews. Five 
     themes emerged: ongoing meaningful engagement with hens, 
     self-expression through creative activities, improved mood and 
     participation, improved social interaction, and enhanced living 
     environment. HenPower offers potential wellbeing benefits to older 
     people living in care homes, many of which echo with existing

     determine the relationship between study variables, in particular, 
     mediating role of voluntary/charity works in the association between 
     loneliness and quality of life cross-sectionally and longitudinally. 
     Results revealed that loneliness was significantly and negatively 
     associated with quality of life over time, and voluntary/charity 
     works appeared to in part mediate the relationship between loneliness 
     and quality of life. Study findings provide evidence for a need for

     AB: Background and purpose. The aim of this paper is to describe and 
     critically analyse creative research methods, exploring how these can 
     offer ways to enable non-verbal and non-ambulant children and young 
     people with cerebral palsy, to express their views about their 
     well-being. The context of this research explored their choices for 
     recreational activities, seeking to understand how their level of 
     participation impacted upon their well-being. Methods. A qualitative 
     comparative case study design was chosen comprising of two 
     interviews, using photographs and diaries to elicit discussion, 
     supported by observations. These observations provided evidence of 
     well-being indicators that were interpreted by the researcher, 
     alongside their parents. Seven participants volunteered, aged nine to 
     sixteen years. Data were analysed utilising Braun and Clark's six 
     stages. Firstly, each case's data sources were coded, themes 
     identified, then across cases comparisons, arriving at three final 
     themes. Triangulation of data sources which made up each case, 
     enhanced the trustworthiness in this study. Results. Observations 
     were key to providing insight into their well-being. Interpretation 
     of this rich data, supported by their parents, revealed that the 
     participants could self-advocate, as shown by their intentional 
     behaviours, to choose their level of participation. Discussion. The 
     researcher's ability to be creative in the data collection methods is 
     original in physiotherapy. It was important to work in partnership 
     with parents, to ensure the correct interpretation of their 
     intentional behaviours from the observations. The diaries and 
     photographs added a unique contribution to knowledge, which enabled 
     the non-verbal participants inclusion, empowering them to express 
     their well-being.]

     skin temperature to 10-15 °C, where pain and swelling are expected 
     to be attenuated. Design. Randomised controlled crossover trial. 
     Setting. University laboratory. Participants. 32 healthy adult 
     participants recruited (1 dropout) with no contraindications to 
     cryocompressive therapy. Intervention. A k-type thermocouple was used 
     to record skin temperature at baseline and every five minutes during 
     a 30-minute cryocompression treatment in a control condition and when 
     using four different device temperature settings (6 °C, 8 °C, 10 
     °C, and 12 °C) on a continuous cold-flow cryocompression device. 
     Conditions were labelled Control, Con-6, Con-8, Con-10, and Con-12, 
     respectively. Main outcome measures. Skin temperature change (°C) 
     throughout cryocompression; time taken (mins) to achieve skin 
     temperature < 15 °C; and the difference between final skin 
     temperature and device temperature setting (°C). Results. Median 
     (IQR) skin temperature after cryocompression was 32.1 °C 
     (29.3-33.4), 12.8 °C (12.1-14.6), 14.3 °C (13.8-15.7), 16.1 °C 
     (15.2-17.3), and 17.7 °C (16.9-18.9) for the Control condition and 
     Con-6, Con-8, Con-10 and Con-12, respectively. It took 20 min (Con-6) 
     and 25 min (Con-8) for skin temperature to reach < 15 °C. A median 
     (IQR) difference of 6.8 °C (6.1-8.6), 6.3 °C (5.8-7.7), 6.1 °C 
     (5.2-7.3), and 5.7 °C (4.9-6.9) for Con-6, Con-8, Con-10, and 
     Con-12, respectively was observed between device temperature setting 
     and final skin temperature. Conclusions. The device is recommended as 
     it reduced skin temperature to the therapeutic range of 10-15 °C 
     during a 30-minute treatment when using the 6 °C or 8 °C device 
     temperature settings. Future research should determine optimal 
     treatment lengths for cryocompression.]

     ACL surgery. Objective. To synthesize the available evidence on the 
     effect of electromyographic biofeedback in the treatment of 
     quadriceps strength following ACL surgery. Design. Systematic review 
     with meta-analysis. Data sources. PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL and 
     Epistemonikos were searched. Eligibility criteria. Randomized 
     clinical trials with patients undergoing ACL reconstruction surgery 
     comparing biofeedback with a standard rehabilitation control group. 
     Data extraction and data synthesis. Two authors selected articles and 
     performed data extraction. The analysed outcomes were strength, 
     function, pain, knee extension and balance. The risk of bias of 
     individual studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. 
     Results were combined through random-effects meta-analysis, reporting 
     mean differences. Results. Eight articles were included in the 
     qualitative analysis, and four articles were included in the 
     quantitative analysis. The interventions lasted between 4 and 12 
     weeks. Three studies evaluated the effect of biofeedback on 
     quadriceps strength; of these, two studies showed a significant 
     difference in favour of the biofeedback group. In addition, 
     biofeedback was found to improve knee extension [standardized mean 
     difference − 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) − 1.74 to −0.86] 
     and balance (one study). There was no significant difference in 
     Lysholm score (mean difference −6.21, 95% CI −17.51 to 5.08; I2 
     =59%) or pain between the biofeedback group and the control group. 
     Conclusion. Electromyographic biofeedback in knee rehabilitation 
     could be useful following ACL reconstruction surgery.]

     were recorded in three specialist settings (long-term pain, 
     orthopaedics, and neuromuscular rehabilitation) across two NHS 
     hospitals. Participants. 15 adult patients (10 female, 5 male; aged 
     20-77) with a scheduled video consultation. Results. Examinations and 
     exercises retain-->were successfully accomplished in all 15 
     consultations. Two key challenges were identified for 
     physiotherapists and patients when doing video assessments: (1) 
     managing safety and clinical risk, and (2) making exercises and 
     movements visible. Challenges were addressed by through communication 
     practices that were patient-centred and tailored to the video context 
     (e.g. explaining how to frame the body to the camera or adjust the 
     camera to make the body visible). Conclusions. Video is being used by 
     physiotherapists to consult with their patients. This can work well, 
     but tailored communication strategies are critical to help 
     participants overcome the challenges of remote physical examinations 
     and exercises.]

     identify the prognostic factors for musculoskeletal conditions, such 
     as shoulder complaints, developed by Keele University, UK. This study 
     assessed whether the Keele STarT MSK tool can predict the risk of 
     poor outcome in non-specific shoulder complaints in a Dutch 
     population. Design. Multicentre prospective cohort study. Setting. 
     Fourteen primary care physiotherapy clinics in the Netherlands 
     participated in this study. Participants. In total, 180 patients with 
     non-specific shoulder complaints with complete data from the Keele 
     STarT MSK tool (baseline), Short-Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12), 
     Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Numeric Pain Rating Score 
     (NPRS) and Global Perceived Effect (GPE) scale at week 6, week 12 or 
     endpoint were included. Data were collected from January 2019 to 
     January 2020. Of these, 180 patients were eligible for the study. Of 
     these, 139 completed the study and were included in the analysis. 
     Main outcome measures. Poor outcome was defined as: SF-12 score ≤33 
     (physical health), SPADI score ≥30% (disability in activity), NPRS 
     score ≥3 (pain intensity) and GPE scale score ≥3 
     (patient-reported recovery). Results. The area under the receiver 
     operating characteristic curves for prediction of outcome were 
     excellent for the SF-12, acceptable for the SPADI and NPRS, and 
     showed no discrimination for the GPE scale. The optimal cut-off value 
     for the Keele STarT MSK score to discriminate between low and 
     medium/high risk groups was ≥5. Conclusions. The Keele STarT MSK 
     tool is able to predict the risk of poor outcome in patients with 
     non-specific shoulder complaints in primary care physiotherapy 
     clinics. Further research is needed to establish whether stratified 
     care (subgrouping and targeted treatment) is more efficient.]

     Victorian Universities in Australia.. Participants. Physiotherapy 
     students of entry-to-professional practice education programs (n = 
     17; mean age 23.7 years, 65% female), having completed at least 15 
     weeks of clinical placements. Results. The overarching theme was that

     variable. The three sub-themes were: 1) students experience 
     significant challenges when working with people with dementia, 2) 
     students experience a range of emotions when working with people with 
     dementia, and 3) the quality of dementia learning experiences during

     was ranked from good to excellent. The myofascial release showed a 
     significant difference in pain (p = 0.03), rotation to the right (p = 
     0.05), and lateral flexion to the right (p = 0.04), compared to other 
     treatment methods. No significant effect was found for improvements 
     in pressure pain threshold. Conclusion. Modest effects are observed 
     in pain reduction, suggesting potential benefits of myofascial 
     release in managing chronic neck pain. Further research with 
     standardized protocols and direct comparisons to established 
     therapies is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of myofascial 
     release efficacy.]

     AB: Objectives. To estimate the effectiveness of exercise at end of 
     treatment and long-term follow-up compared to a control condition or 
     other conservative treatments in patients with Greater Trochanteric 
     Pain Syndrome (GTPS). Methods. Databases were searched September 2021 
     and updated September 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) 
     comparing exercise interventions for patients with GTPS, to a control 
     condition; corticosteroid injection; shock wave therapy; or other 
     types of exercise programs were included. Risk of bias was assessed 
     using the ROB2 tool. Meta-analyses were performed using a 
     random-effects model. The certainty of the evidence was rated by the 
     GRADE approach. Results. Six RCTs including a total of 733 patients 
     with GTPS were included. Three trials compared exercise to sham 
     exercise or wait-and-see control groups, two trials compared exercise 
     to corticosteroid injection, two trials compared exercise to 
     shockwave therapy, and one trial compared exercise to another type of 
     exercise. Meta-analyses showed that in the long term, exercise 
     slightly reduces hip pain and disease severity, while slightly 
     improving patient-reported physical function and global rating of 
     change compared to a control condition. No serious adverse events 
     were reported. Compared to corticosteroid injection, exercise 
     improves long-term global rating of change. Conclusion. The current 
     evidence supports a strong recommendation for exercise as first line 
     treatment in patients clinically diagnosed with GTPS. Compared to 
     corticosteroid injection, exercise is superior in increasing the 
     likelihood that a patient experiences a meaningful global 
     improvement. These results are based on few trials and a moderate 
     number of patients.]

     AB: Background. Starting rehabilitation soon after an acute 
     exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is 
     crucial to diminish the detrimental effects of this acute event on 
     muscle function. However, uptake in outpatient pulmonary 
     rehabilitation is low. Objectives. To design and test a feasible, 
     acceptable and accessible exercise training program (ETP) in primary 
     care for patients experiencing an AECOPD. Design. (1) A literature 
     review and qualitative study to develop an ETP and (2) A feasibility 
     study of the ETP implemented in primary care. Methods. (1) The 
     development of the ETP proceeded in several phases with input from 
     different stakeholders through focus group discussions. (2) Patients 
     experiencing a moderate or severe AECOPD were included and followed 
     the ETP for two weeks with a physiotherapist in primary care. 
     Interviews with the participants took place and patients were given 
     the choice to complete the eight-week program. Results. (1) Six 
     discussion sessions took place. The ETP contained a flexible set of 
     progressively more difficult exercises applicable in a primary care 
     practice. (2) Eight patients experiencing a moderate (n = 1) or 
     severe (n = 7) AECOPD were included. Patients started the first 
     physiotherapy session 5 (2−6) days after the start of their 
     symptoms or hospital discharge. Seven patients wanted to complete the 
     ETP. Conclusions. An ETP in primary care is feasible, acceptable and 
     accessible for patients experiencing a moderate or severe AECOPD, and 
     for physiotherapists. The effectiveness of this ETP on muscle 
     function and physical activity is currently under investigation in a 
     RCT.]

     for reducing pain in women with fibromyalgia. Design. Single-blind, 
     randomised controlled, equivalence trial. Setting. Fibromyalgia, 
     Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity 
     Association in A Coruña, Spain. Participants. Forty women with 
     fibromyalgia were assigned at random in a 1:1 manner to two groups: 
     AT (n = 20) and LBT (n = 20). Interventions. Two therapeutic exercise 
     programmes, with 60-min sessions, were undertaken three times per 
     week for 12 weeks. Sessions were carried out in groups by a trained 
     physiotherapist. Outcome. The primary outcome was pain intensity 
     (visual analogue scale). The secondary outcomes were pressure pain 
     threshold (algometer), quality of life (Revised Fibromyalgia Impact 
     Questionnaire), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), 
     fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory) and physical ability 
     (6-Minute Walk Test). Patients were evaluated at baseline, 12 weeks 
     (post-treatment) and 18 weeks (follow-up). The statistical analysis 
     was per-protocol. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance. 
     Effect size was calculated. Results. The mean age was 50 [standard 
     deviation (SD) 9] years, with median body mass index of 27 
     [interquartile range (IQR) 25-30] kg/m2 and median symptom duration 
     of 11 (IQR 6-15) years. No differences were observed between the 
     groups post-treatment, but differences in favour of AT were found in 
     pain intensity [2.7 (IQR 1.5-4.9) vs 5.5 (IQR 3.3-7.6); p= 0.023; 
     large effect, Cohen's d= 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-1.5] 
     and sleep quality [12.0 (IQR 7.3-15.3) vs 15.0 (IQR 13.0-17.0); p= 
     0.030; large effect, Cohen's d= 0.8; 95% CI 0.1-1.5] at follow-up. 
     Conclusions. The results suggest that AT is better than LBT for 
     reducing pain intensity and improving sleep quality after 6 weeks of 
     follow-up. AT may be a good treatment option for women with 
     fibromyalgia.]

     AB: Introduction. Placements are a key component of physiotherapy 
     courses; however, placement providers struggle to meet rising 
     demands. To enhance placement capacity, multi-models are increasingly 
     employed, where Universities place more than one student with one 
     educator. Student support on placement is important, and studies 
     exploring multi-placement models reveal educators welcome the peer 
     support possible with this placement pattern. This research explored 
     UK physiotherapy students' perspectives of peer relationships during 
     placements, for which there is yet little research. Methods. Eight 
     single, semi-structured interviews were conducted, exploring 
     students' experiences of peer working on placement October to 
     December 2020. Participants and researchers were undergraduate 
     students at the same UK university. Interviews were virtual, recorded 
     via Microsoft Teams and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were 
     analysed first individually, then collaboratively, sharing ideas and 
     interpretations using a phenomenologically informed analytical lens. 
     Results. Two main themes were identified: collaboration vs conflict 
     and supportive vs hindering relationships. Students appreciated the 
     emotional and academic support from peers, but there could be 
     difficulties in generating constructive peer relationships, and 
     sometimes a sense of competition from divided tutor attention. 
     Conclusion. Multi-model placements provide social and emotional 
     support to students, increasing their confidence. Peer relationships 
     present opportunities for collaborative working and academic support 
     if they are adequately framed as such by the practice educator and 
     wider team. Students may benefit from university-based support to 
     prepare them to maximise the peer relationship. Practice educators 
     may benefit from information about supporting students in multi-model 
     placements. Student-led research can offer rich qualitative data and 
     helpful educational solutions.]

     AB: Objectives. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid transition 
     to telehealth. Telehealth presents challenges for rehabilitation of 
     stroke survivors with moderate-to-severe physical disability, which 
     traditionally relies on physical interactions. The objective was to 
     co-design resources to support delivery of rehabilitation via 
     telehealth for this cohort. Design. Four-stage integrated knowledge 
     translation co-design approach. Stage 1: Research team comprising 
     researchers, clinicians and stroke survivors defined the research 
     question and approach. Stage 2: Workshops and interviews were 
     conducted with knowledge users (participants) to identify essential 
     elements of the program. Stage 3: Resources developed by the research 
     team. Stage 4: Resources reviewed by knowledge users and adapted. 
     Participants. Twenty-one knowledge users (clinicians n = 11, stroke 
     survivors n = 7, caregivers n = 3) Results. All stakeholders 
     emphasised the complexities of telehealth rehabilitation for stroke 
     and the need for individualised programs. Shared decision-making was 
     identified as critical. Potential risks and benefits of telehealth 
     were acknowledged and strategies to ameliorate risks and deliver 
     effective rehabilitation were identified. Four freely available 
     online resources were co-designed; three resources to support 
     clinicians with shared decision-making and risk management and a 
     decision-aid to support stroke survivors and caregivers throughout 
     the process. Over six months, 1129 users have viewed the webpage; 
     clinician resources were downloaded 374 times and the decision-aid 
     was downloaded 570 times. Conclusions. The co-design process 
     identified key elements for delivery of telehealth rehabilitation to 
     stroke survivors with moderate-to-severe physical disability and led 
     to development of resources to support development of an 
     individualised telehealth rehabilitation plan. Future research should 
     evaluate the effectiveness of these resources.]

     AB: Objectives. To determine the feasibility of completing a 
     definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT), evaluating the clinical 
     and cost-effectiveness of Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT) in 
     comparison to usual physiotherapy care (UPC), for people with 
     persistent low back pain (LBP). Design and setting. A two-arm 
     parallel feasibility RCT completed in a United Kingdom (UK) Secondary 
     Care National Health Service (NHS) physiotherapy service. 
     Participants. Sixty adult participants who reported LBP lasting for 
     more than three months, that was not attributable to a serious (e.g. 
     cancer) or specific (e.g. radiculopathy) underlying cause, were 
     invited to participate. Participants were allocated at random to 
     receive CFT or UPC. Interventions. Cognitive Functional Therapy and 
     Usual Physiotherapy Care for persistent LBP. Main outcome measures. 
     The primary outcome was the feasibility of completing a definitive 
     RCT, defined by recruitment of at least 5 participants per month, 
     delivery of CFT per protocol and securing relevant and acceptable 
     outcome measures. Data concerning study processes, resources, 
     management and participant reported outcome measures were collected 
     at baseline, 3, 6 and 12-month follow-up. Results. Sixty participants 
     (n = 30 CFT and n = 30 UPC) were recruited with 80% (n = 48), 72% (n 
     = 43) and 53% (n = 32) retained at 3, 6 and 12-month follow-up 
     respectively. NHS physiotherapists were trained to competence and 
     delivered CFT with fidelity. CFT was tolerated by participants with 
     no adverse events. Relevant and clinically important outcome data 
     were collected at all time points (0.4%, 3%, 1% and 0.8% of data was 
     missing from the returned outcome measure booklets at baseline and 3, 
     6 and 12-month follow-up respectively). The Roland-Morris disability 
     questionnaire was considered the most suitable primary outcome 
     measure with a proposed sample size of 540 participants for a 
     definitive cluster RCT. Conclusion. It is feasible to conduct a 
     randomised study of CFT in comparison to UPC for NHS patients. A 
     future study should incorporate an internal pilot to address aspects 
     of feasibility further, including participant retention strategies.]

     AB: Introduction. Healthcare systems are struggling to deliver 
     high-quality low back pain (LBP) care. In 2012 specialist 
     physiotherapist-led musculoskeletal (MSK) triage services were 
     introduced in Irish hospitals to expedite patient care and alleviate 
     pressure on elective orthopaedic/ rheumatology consultant clinics. 
     Specialist physiotherapists have expertise to inform health service 
     improvement and reform, but their perspectives of LBP healthcare 
     delivery have received scant attention. Objectives. To explore 
     specialist physiotherapists' perspectives on LBP care in Ireland, the 
     barriers and facilitators to quality LBP care and the development of 
     MSK interface services in primary care settings. Design. 
     Cross-sectional observational study using an anonymous electronic 
     survey with thematic framework analysis of response data from 
     open-ended questions. Participants. Thirty-four clinical specialist 
     physiotherapists in Irish MSK triage services. Results. Thematic 
     analysis resulted in six overarching themes, grouped into two 
     categories. One category pertained to LBP healthcare in Ireland with 
     the following three themes: 1) Inadequate health services for 
     patients with LBP; 2) Need for defined LBP clinical pathways; 3) Need 
     for a multisectoral approach to spine health. Themes in the second 
     category, pertaining to the development of community-based MSK 
     interface services, were: 4) Concern regarding isolation from 
     secondary care services; 5) Unrealistic expectations of MSK triage; 
     6) Improved communication and collaboration with primary care 
     services. Conclusion. Specialist physiotherapists have concerns 
     regarding LBP health services and persistence of a biomedical, 
     secondary care-led approach. They advocate for investment in primary 
     care multi-disciplinary teams, enhanced integration across primary 
     and secondary care, development of a national clinical pathway and a 
     multisectoral approach.]

     at ICU discharge using the CPAx and PFIT-s in random order. Main 
     outcome measures. Responsiveness to change, minimal clinically 
     important difference (MCID), floor and ceiling effect, and convergent 
     validity. Results. CPAx demonstrated a large responsiveness (effect 
     size index (ESI)= 0.83) and PFIT-s moderate responsiveness (ESI=0.73) 
     to change in scores. MCID for CPAx was 2.1 (standard error of 
     measurement (SEM) 1.1) and for PFIT-s 0.6 (SEM=0.3). CPAx had no 
     floor effect and a small ceiling effect (9%, n = 6) at ICU discharge 
     compared to 2% (n = 1) floor and 48% (n = 32) ceiling effects of 
     PFIT-s. Moderate convergent validity was found for both tools at ICU 
     admission (n = 67, r = 0.62, p < 0.001) and discharge (n = 67, r = 
     0.51, p < 0.001). Conclusion. CPAx is most responsive to changes in 
     physical function and activity scores, has no floor and limited 
     ceiling effects and moderate convergent validity, and is recommended 
     for similar cohorts.]

     AB: Motion sickness (MS) is a disorder of the autonomic nervous 
     system caused by abnormal exercise with symptoms such as nausea, 
     vomiting and drowsiness. More than 90% of the human population has 
     experienced different degrees of MS. At present, anticholinergics, 
     antihistamines, and sympathomimetic drugs are used for treating MS, 
     but these drugs generally have some adverse reactions and are not 
     suitable for all people. Therefore, it is necessary to develop 
     anti-MS drugs that have high efficiency and no adverse effects. 
     Previous studies have found that Chroogomphus rutilus polysaccharide 
     (CRP) is effective at preventing and treating MS in rats and mice. 
     However, its mechanism of action is not clear. To clarify whether the 
     CRP has anti-MS effects in mice, and to clarify its mechanism, we 
     performed behavioral, biochemical, and morphological tests in a 
     Kunming mouse model. Our results indicate that CRPs can significantly 
     relieve the symptoms of MS, and their effect is equivalent to that of 
     scopolamine, a commonly used anti-MS medicine. Our results indicate 
     that CRPs may directly act on the gastrointestinal chromaffin cells 
     to inhibit the synthesis and release of serotonin 
     (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) and thus reduce the signal from the 
     gastrointestinal tract.]

     AB: Mycochemical properties and bioactivities of Ganoderma resinaceum 
     and Serpula similis remain unexplored. The present study assessed 
     antioxidant, cytotoxicity, and cell migration abilities of Ganoderma 
     and Serpula extracts, followed by their phytochemical analyses. The 
     MTT assay was conducted to determine the cytotoxicity along with the 
     cell migration studies in human cancer cell lines. The antioxidant 
     profiles were evaluated through DPPH and FRAP assays. Furthermore, 
     LC−MS/MS analysis was performed to elucidate the phytochemicals 
     responsible for anticancer and antioxidant activities. Significant 
     concentration-dependent cytotoxicities of 12.7% and 13.7% were 
     observed against HCT 116 cell lines at 1% and 5% concentrations of 
     the G. resinaceum extract, respectively. Similarly, significant 
     concentration-dependent cytotoxicities of 6.7% and 25.5% were 
     observed at 1% and 5% concentrations of the S. similis extract, 
     respectively. The extracts of G. resinaceum and S. similis both shows 
     better anti-migration potential in lung cancer cells. Both extracts 
     demonstrated good scavenging activity on DPPH and ferric ion free 
     radicals. LC−MS analysis revealed 11 compounds from S. similis and 
     15 compounds from G. resinaceum fruiting bodies. Compounds such as 
     terpenoids, alkaloids, cytotoxic peptides, and other metabolites were 
     identified as major components in both extracts. These extracts 
     exhibited cytotoxic activity against HCT 116 cancer cells, along with 
     moderate antioxidant activity. This implies that the extracts might 
     be used as bioactive natural sources in the pharmaceutical and food 
     industries.]

     AB: Diseases caused by a compromised immune system, characterized by 
     decreased production and diversification of T lymphocytes, such as 
     immunodeficiencies or chronic infections, are becoming increasingly 
     prominent. These diseases lead to increased vulnerability to 
     infections caused by parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other 
     microorganisms. According to various articles, Trametes versicolor 
     has been used as immunotherapy and cancer treatment due to its 
     polysaccharides, which have shown their value in traditional 
     medicine. However, most of the studies have been done with Asian 
     samples. For this reason, the aim of this study was to evaluate the 
     effect of samples of Mexican T. versicolor on human lymphoid cells. 
     Of various extracts, the one with the best T cell proliferative 
     response was the extract produced by maceration in water at room 
     temperature, but all treatments in aqueous and ethanolic extracts 
     increased the lymphocyte count, showing that extracts of Mexican T. 
     versicolor also have compounds that stimulate T cells. Unfortunately, 
     genetic damage expressed as an increment in micronuclei count was 
     identified, so using these fungus extracts in traditional medicine 
     would require careful control of recommended doses.]

     AB: Mushrooms are prevalently important sources of pharmaceutically

     Lentinus genus are recognized for their nutritional and therapeutic 
     properties. One such species is L. sajor-caju, which is renowned in 
     Southeast Asian nations for its culinary value. The primary goal of 
     this study is to investigate the potential medicinal properties of L. 
     sajor-caju, specifically its antioxidant, antibacterial, and 
     anti-inflammatory effects. A hydroethanolic extract was formulated 
     using dried basidiocarps, which exhibited a high phenolic content of 
     approximately 14% and a flavonoid content of approximately 2.7%. The 
     extract demonstrated significant antioxidant potential in in vitro 
     reactions. The extract is sufficiently capable of scavenging free 
     radicals (DPPH and ABTS) and chelate Fe2+ with EC50 values spanning 
     from 186 to 390 μg/mL. In addition, considerable antimicrobial 
     activity against tested pathogenic microorganisms was observed, as 
     indicated by low MIC50 values (256−358 μg/mL). Moreover, the 
     fraction was found to prevent heat-induced protein denaturation which 
     signifies its anti-inflammatory potential. When tested on the RAW 
     264.7 cell line, reduction in the nitrite production, and 
     downregulation of COX-2 and iNOS mRNA expression was observed which 
     are the key regulator of inflammatory signalling systems. The study, 
     therefore, recommends the use of L. sajor-caju in the medical and 
     pharmaceutical industries for the benefit of humanity.]

     redox status parameters (superoxide anion radical, nitrites and 
     reduced glutathione) were determined spectrophotometrically on a 
     human colorectal cancer cell line and human health fibroblasts cells. 
     The results were measured 24 and 72 h after the treatment. Tested 
     extracts exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity with MIC values 
     from 0.004 to 20 mg/mL. The maximum antimicrobial activity was found

     AB: In humans, a wide range of health disorders have been induced due 
     to an imbalanced metabolism and an excess generation of reactive 
     oxygen species (ROS). Different biological properties found in 
     mushrooms seem to be the reason for their customary use as a 
     favourite delicacy. Therefore, exploration of wild edible mushrooms 
     as a source of various biological compounds is gaining much 
     importance today. Amanita konajensis, one of the underutilized 
     macrofungi popularly consumed in Eastern India, demands a systematic 
     study of its medicinal values. The study aims to explore the 
     myco-chemical contents of A. konajensis ethanolic extract (EtAK1) and 
     screen their antioxidant potency through various in vitro assays. 
     GC-MS analysis identified the chemical components of EtAK1. Further, 
     structure-based virtual screening of the identified compounds was 
     analysed for drug-like properties and molecular docking with the 
     human p38 MAPK protein, a potent targeting pathway for human lung 
     cancer. The morpho-molecular features proved the authenticity of the 
     collected mushroom. The screening assays showed that EtAK1 was 
     abundant in flavonoids, followed by phenolics, β-carotene, and 
     lycopene, and had strong antioxidant activity with EC50 values of 
     640-710 μg/mL. The GC-MS analyses of EtAK1 identified the occurrence 
     of 19 bioactive compounds in the mushroom. In silico analysis 
     revealed that anthraergostatetraenol p-chlorobenzoate, one of the 
     compounds identified, displayed high binding affinity (ΔG = -10.6 
     kcal/mol) with human p38 MAPK. The outcome of this study will pave 
     the way for the invention of myco-medicine using A. konajensis, which 
     may lead to a novel drug for human lung cancer.]

     standard format across three hub sites. During a virtual "Harvest" 
     session all sites were video linked to continue the local dialogue on 
     a national level. Outcomes were analyzed using mixed methods, 
     including pre- and post-session surveys quantitative methods. Notes 
     from table discussions were analyzed using a qualitative approach. 
     RESULTS: Qualitative results offered a rich dataset from the industry 
     and academic perspective to provide a better understanding how the 
     CETF recommendations are being understood. Ideas for future action 
     and partnerships were identified. Various regions contributed 
     insights that reflect unique environments. CONCLUSIONS: The ASAHP 
     Collaborative Stakeholder Engagement Model offers a robust and 
     reproducible active adult learning model for IPC that can lead to 
     change and continued engagement. These findings identify 
     opportunities for deepening the connections made through regional 
     hubs.]

     AB: BACKGROUND: Interprofessional education is recognized as an 
     important part of the training of future health professionals. 
     Limited investigation has been done on the experiences of students 
     who have completed interprofessional mentored research during their 
     clinical training. PURPOSE: To explore if this experience provided 
     meaningful training in key areas of interprofessional education. 
     METHOD: Using a qualitative descriptive framework, one-on-one 
     interviews were conducted with eight healthcare providers (three 
     occupational therapists and five speech language pathologists) who 
     engaged in interprofessional research during their clinical training. 
     Qualitative content analysis was completed with triangulation by 
     analyst and member checking. CONCLUSION: Three main themes were 
     identified: 1) inter-professional research project collaboration, 2) 
     professional development, and 3) recommendations for student-oriented 
     interprofessional research collaborations. The results illustrated 
     that the health practitioners found their student experiences 
     valuable to their current interprofessional practice and provided 
     salient training on roles and respon- sibilities, teamwork, and 
     communication.]

     AB: Health professions students in their final year of the mental 
     health counseling (MHC), nursing, occupational therapy (OT), 
     pharmacy, physical therapy, physician assistant, and speech/language 
     pathology programs at Touro University participated in a virtual 
     interprofessional education (IPE) symposium designed to promote 
     interprofessional collaboration. The students worked as an 
     interprofessional team with a faculty facilitator to first create a 
     plan of care and later a discharge plan for a fictitious patient. At 
     the completion of the symposium, 281 out of 311 students completed 
     the Interprofessional Collaborative Competency Attainment Survey 
     (ICCAS), a tool that assesses competency in collaborative practice. 
     Results demonstrated a significant increase in every 
     collaboration-related competency for all participants as a group (p < 
     0.001), as well as significant differences between professions (F = 
     2.99, p = 0.007). For example, students from OT rated themselves 
     lowest at the start and showed the greatest gains, and students from 
     MHC showed the smallest gains but had the fewest participants. This 
     virtual symposium resolved some common logistical challenges and was 
     effective at improving interprofessional collaborative competency. 
     Including a wide variety of health professions in this IPE activity 
     facilitated a broad reach and applicability to the interprofessional 
     teams that students will encounter in the future.]

     AB: For many decades, academic cheating has been prevalent across 
     many institutions and majors. This problem has been exacerbated by 
     new technology that has increased opportunities for students to 
     access and use information dishonestly. There is fear amongst faculty 
     that dishonesty in the academic world could negatively impact 
     professionals in their future careers. The greater prevalence of 
     cheating may be related to students misunderstanding what constitutes 
     cheating. To better understand students' perceptions of cheating, a 
     group of faculty surveyed students across 11 academic programs at a 
     college of health professions using a slightly modified version of a 
     validated tool via an online platform. Data about cheating 
     perceptions were collected from more than 400 students. Although most 
     respondents agreed that cheating is wrong, some were open to 
     explanations of innocence related to possible cheating scenarios. 
     Also, most respondents did not agree that a person who cheats is an 
     unethical person. These findings suggest that students believe 
     cheating can occur unintentionally. Although the findings support 
     that more education about academic dishonesty would be valuable, this 
     study can inform efforts to develop more targeted education and 
     interventions to reduce cheating behaviors.]

     Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) programs in the United States. In 
     addition, faculty expertise and perceptions regarding integrating SUD 
     content in curricula were explored. METHODS: An 18-item survey was 
     emailed to DPT program directors, who were requested to complete it 
     themselves or forward it to another faculty member. Data about SUD 
     curricular content, barriers to implementation, faculty expertise, 
     and demographics were collected. Data characterizing how SUD content 
     was taught in the curriculum and faculty expertise and attitudes were 
     summarized using frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: Thirty-four 
     (14%) of 242 accredited DPT programs participated in the study. 
     Twenty-seven (79%) of the respondents were program directors. All 
     programs (n=34) addressed SUDs, but the delivery of SUD content and 
     hours devoted were varied. Signs and symptoms of SUD were most often 
     discussed (88%), whereas a brief negotiated interview was least 
     likely to be addressed (18%). DISCUSSION: SUD curricular content in 
     DPT programs may need to be more substantial. To prepare entry-level 
     practitioners, evidence-based SUD assessment and curricular 
     guidelines could be integrated into academic programs.]

     AB: PURPOSE: Physician assistant (PA) programs have an aca- demically 
     rigorous curriculum, which places a myriad of pressures on students 
     and contributes to burnout. The benefits of optimal quality and 
     quantity of sleep are well documented, yet students still view 
     sacrificing sleep as a necessary step in academic success. The 
     purpose of this pilot study was to create behavior changes to promote 
     optimal sleep hygiene in PA school and decrease measure- ments of 
     burnout. METHODS: 39 PA students from a single institution 
     volunteered to take part in an 8-week study. Wrist actigraphy was 
     used to measure students' sleeping habits, resting heart rate, and 
     physical activity. Additionally, the students completed a 
     questionnaire regarding stimulant and sleep aid use and burnout 
     (Maslach Burnout Inven- tory) at two time points. The intervention 
     was 8 weeks in duration split into 2, 4-week blocks separated by a 
     1-hour, evidence-based education intervention to promote beneficial 
     behavior change and sleep hygiene. RESULTS: Sleep duration, wake 
     time, and bedtime remained consistent across the study period with no 
     changes post-intervention (p > 0.05). Moderate to high levels of 
     cynicism and emotional exhaustion were seen in more than 
     three-quarters of students. There was no relationship between sleep 
     duration and exam scores, heart rate, or steps. Shorter sleep 
     duration predicted increased emotional exhaustion and cynicism (p < 
     0.05). CONCLUSION: Sleeping habits influence emotional well-being and 
     are likely minimally affected by educational interventions alone. 
     Combatting the high prevalence of burnout in PA schools can begin 
     with targeting environmental and policy-level changes that can influ- 
     ence student recovery and well-being opportunities throughout the 
     academic year.]

     preparation for collaborative practice, this research illuminated the 
     nature of allied health collaborative practice capability. Literature 
     and perceptions of allied health students and academics were examined 
     using a philosophical hermeneutic approach. A literature text set was 
     constructed from a range of health and health education related 
     fields. An experiential text was constructed from two sources; focus 
     groups with students and semi-structured interviews with academics. 
     Through this research we identified a plurality of capabilities that 
     coalesce to become allied health collaborative practice capability. 
     These dimensions and capabilities are: contextual (adaptability, 
     responsiveness and persistence), social (friendliness, openness and 
     reciprocity), and individual (professional expertise, willingness and 
     flexibility). Capabilities illuminated in this research included 
     skills and qualities. The plurality and coalescence of capabilities 
     identified in this research highlight the complex nature of 
     collaborative practice capability. A challenge remains to bring the 
     more tacit qualities and how they interact into focus so that they 
     receive meaningful attention to inform practice development and 
     education.]

     AB: Resistance training is considered the most effective intervention 
     for increasing older people's muscle mass and strength. Thus, we 
     created the Sukubara®, a self-administered training system (squat + 
     balance training) that incorporates a new low-load exercise. In this 
     study, we hypothesize that introducing Sukubara® will positively 
     affect skeletal muscle mass and physical function. A preliminary 
     verification was carried out on healthy, non-elderly participants who 
     were recruited from the hospital staff. Participants were randomly 
     assigned to two groups for a 12-week intervention: the resistance 
     training group (R group) that performed the Sukubara® exercise 
     program and the control group (C group) that did not. This study's 
     primary endpoint was a change in skeletal muscle mass, while the 
     secondary endpoints were knee extension strength and one-leg standing 
     time with eyes closed. An analysis of the 18 participants (R group = 
     8; C group = 10) was performed. Results showed that skeletal muscle 
     mass, knee extension strength, and one-leg standing time were 
     significantly improved or tended to be significantly higher in the R 
     group than in the C group. Our study concluded that, by incorporating 
     low-load exercise, Sukubara® resulted in muscle hypertrophy and 
     improved physical function.]

     AB: Background. The incidence of stroke and stroke-related 
     hemiparesis has been steadily increasing and is projected to become a 
     serious social, financial, and physical burden on the aging 
     population. Limited access to outpatient rehabilitation for these 
     stroke survivors further deepens the healthcare issue and estranges 
     the stroke patient demographic in rural areas. However, new advances 
     in motion detection deep learning enable the use of handheld 
     smartphone cameras for body tracking, offering unparalleled levels of 
     accessibility. Methods. In this study we want to develop an automated 
     method for evaluation of a shortened variant of the Fugl-Meyer 
     assessment, the standard stroke rehabilitation scale describing upper 
     extremity motor function. We pair this technology with a series of 
     machine learning models, including different neural network 
     structures and an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model, to score 16 of 33 
     (49%) Fugl-Meyer item activities. Results. In this observational 
     study, 45 acute stroke patients completed at least 1 recorded 
     Fugl-Meyer assessment for the training of the auto-scorers, which 
     yielded average accuracies ranging from 78.1% to 82.7% item-wise. 
     Conclusion. In this study, an automated method was developed for the 
     evaluation of a shortened variant of the Fugl-Meyer assessment, the 
     standard stroke rehabilitation scale describing upper extremity motor 
     function. This novel method is demonstrated with potential to conduct 
     telehealth rehabilitation evaluations and assessments with accuracy 
     and availability.]

     AB: Background. Postural instability and gait dysfunction (PIGD) is a 
     cardinal symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is exacerbated under 
     dual-task conditions. Dual-task training (DTT), enhances gait 
     performance, however it is time and cost intensive. Digitizing DTT 
     via the Dual-task Augmented Reality Treatment (DART) platform can 
     expand the availability of an effective intervention to address PIGD. 
     Objective. The aim of this project was to evaluate DART in the 
     treatment of PIGD in people with PD compared to a Traditional DTT 
     intervention. It was hypothesized that both groups would exhibit 
     significant improvements in gait, and the improvements for the DART 
     group would be non-inferior to Traditional DTT.. Methods. A 
     single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 47 PD 
     participants with PIGD. Both groups completed 16 therapeutic sessions 
     over 8 weeks; the DART platform delivered DTT via the Microsoft 
     HoloLens2. Primary outcomes included clinical ratings and single- and 
     dual-task gait biomechanical outcomes. Results. Clinical measures of 
     PD symptoms remained stable for DART and Traditional DTT groups. 
     However, both groups exhibited a significant increase in gait 
     velocity, cadence, and step length during single- and multiple 
     dual-task conditions following the interventions. Improvements in 
     gait velocity in the DART group were non-inferior to Traditional DTT 
     under the majority of conditions. Conclusion. Non-inferior 
     improvements in gait parameters across groups provides evidence of 
     the DART platform being an effective digital therapeutic capable of 
     improving PIGD. Effective digital delivery of DTT has the potential 
     to increase use and accessibility to a promising, yet underutilized 
     and difficult to administer, intervention for PIGD.]

     AB: Background. Reaching is a fundamental motor skill often impaired 
     in cerebral palsy (CP). Studies on manual function, intervention, and 
     underlying brain mechanisms largely focus on unilateral CP. This 
     first electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation of reaching exclusively 
     in bilateral CP aims to quantify and relate brain activation patterns 
     to bimanual deficits in this population. Methods. A total of 15 
     children with bilateral CP (13.4 ± 2.9 years) and 13 with typical 
     development (TD: 14.3 ± 2.4 years) performed 45 reaches per hand 
     while recording motion capture and EEG data. The Box and Blocks test 
     was administered bilaterally. Cortical sources were identified using 
     independent component analysis and clustered using k-means. Alpha 
     (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) band event-related desynchronization 
     (ERD) values were compared across groups and hands within clusters, 
     between dominant and non-dominant sensorimotor clusters, and related 
     to reach kinematics and the Box and Block test. Results. The group 
     with CP demonstrated bimanual motor deficits with slower reaches, 
     lower Box and Blocks scores, and stronger hand preference than in TD. 
     Beta ERD, representing motor execution, was notably higher in the 
     dominant sensorimotor cluster in CP compared to TD. Both groups 
     demonstrated more contralateral than ipsilateral activity in both 
     hands and clusters, with CP showing a less lateralized (more 
     bilateral) alpha response. Higher brain activation was generally 
     related to better function. Conclusion. Bimanual deficits in 
     bilateral CP and related EEG differences warrant more clinical and 
     research attention particularly earlier in life when greater 
     potential for neural and functional recovery exists.]

     AB: Background. Exercise priming, pairing high intensity exercise 
     with a motor learning task, improves retention of upper extremity 
     tasks in individuals after stroke, but has shown no benefit to 
     locomotor learning. This difference may relate to the type of 
     learning studied. Upper extremity studies used explicit, strategic 
     tasks; locomotor studies used implicit sensorimotor adaptation 
     (split-belt treadmill). Since walking is an important rehabilitation 
     goal, it is crucial to understand under which circumstances exercise 
     priming may improve retention of a newly learned walking pattern. 
     Objective. Determine the impact of exercise priming on explicit, 
     strategic locomotor learning task retention in chronic stroke 
     survivors. Methods. Chronic stroke survivors (>6 months) performed 2 
     treadmill walking sessions. Visual feedback was used to train 
     increased step length. Participants were assigned to control group 
     (no exercise), continuous exercise (5 minutes high intensity), or 
     long-interval exercise (15 minutes high/moderate intervals). After 
     day 1 learning, participants either rested or performed exercise. On 
     day 2, retention of the learned walking pattern was tested. Results. 
     All groups learned on day 1 (P < .001). The 2 priming groups showed 
     significant changes in blood lactate and heart rate after exercise 
     priming, the resting control group did not (P < .001). On day 2, 
     there was no significant between-group difference in cued or un-cued 
     task retention (P = .963 and .287, respectively). Conclusions. 
     Exercise priming did not affect retention of an explicit locomotor 
     task in chronic stroke survivors. Further work should explore 
     subgroups of individuals for whom priming may have selective clinical 
     benefit to locomotor learning.]

     AB: Background. Over activity of the rectus femoris is often cited as 
     a main cause for stiff knee gait (SKG). Botulinum toxin (BoNT) can be 
     used to reduce this over activity. Inconsistent results for the 
     effect of BoNT injections were found in literature which can possibly 
     be explained by the study design as these were uncontrolled or 
     non-randomized studies. Objective. To conduct a randomized controlled 
     trial (RCT) to investigate the effect of botulinum toxin type A 
     (BoNT-A) injections in the rectus femoris on gait kinematics and 
     functional outcome in adult stroke patients. Methods. Twenty-six 
     participants were included in this triple-blind cross-over RCT. The 
     intervention consisted of an injection with BoNT-A. Placebo is an 
     injection with saline. Besides knee and hip kinematics, functional 
     outcomes were measured. Results. Comparison of the effect of BoNT-A 
     injection to placebo injection showed a significant increase in peak 
     knee flexion and knee range of motion of 6.7° and 4.8° 
     respectively. There was no difference in hip kinematics. In 
     functional outcomes, only the 6 Minute Walking Test showed a 
     significant increase of 18.3 m. Conclusions. BoNT-A injections in the 
     rectus femoris is a valuable treatment option for stroke patients 
     walking with a SKG to improve knee kinematics. To study the effect on 
     functional outcome more research is necessary with different 
     functional outcome measures that can capture the effect in 
     kinematics. It is important to use kinematic measurements to 
     demonstrate effects in quality of movement that are not captured by

     AB: Background. Chronic sensory loss is a common and undertreated 
     consequence of many forms of neurological injury. Emerging evidence 
     indicates that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) delivered during tactile 
     rehabilitation promotes recovery of somatosensation. Objective. Here, 
     we characterize the amount, intensity, frequency, and duration of VNS 
     therapy paradigms to determine the optimal dosage for VNS-dependent 
     enhancement of recovery in a model of peripheral nerve injury (PNI). 
     Methods. Rats underwent transection of the medial and ulnar nerves in 
     the forelimb, resulting in chronic sensory loss in the paw. Eight 
     weeks after injury, rats were implanted with a VNS cuff and received 
     tactile rehabilitation sessions consisting of repeated mechanical 
     stimulation of the previously denervated forepaw paired with short 
     bursts of VNS. Rats received VNS therapy in 1 of 6 systematically 
     varied dosing schedules to identify a paradigm that balanced therapy 
     effectiveness with a shorter regimen. Results. Delivering 200 VNS 
     pairings a day 4 days a week for 4 weeks produced the greatest 
     percent improvement in somatosensory function compared to any of the 
     6 other groups (One Way analysis of variance at the end of therapy, 
     F[4 70] P = .005). Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that an 
     effective VNS therapy dosage delivers many stimulations per session, 
     with many sessions per week, over many weeks. These results provide a 
     framework to inform the development of VNS-based therapies for 
     sensory restoration.]

     AB: Background. Exercise and cognitive training have been shown to 
     induce neuroplastic changes and modulate cognitive function following 
     stroke. However, it remains unclear whether hybridized 
     exercise-cognitive training facilitates cortical activity and further 
     influences cognitive function after stroke. Objective. The study 
     aimed to investigate the effects of 2 hybridized exercise-cognitive 
     trainings on neuroplastic changes and behavioral outcomes in stroke 
     survivors with mild cognitive decline. Methods. This study was a 
     single-blind randomized controlled trial. Stroke survivors were 
     randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) sequential exercise-cognitive 
     training (SEQ), (2) dual-task exercise-cognitive training (DUAL), or 
     (3) control group (CON). All groups underwent training 60 min per 
     day, 3 days per week, for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcome 
     was the resting-state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) in functional 
     magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary behavioral outcomes included 
     cognitive and physical functions. Results. After 12 weeks of 
     training, patients in the SEQ group (n = 21) exhibited increased RS 
     FC between the left occipital lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus with 
     right parietal lobe, compared to the DUAL (n = 22) and CON (n = 20) 
     groups. Additionally, patients in the DUAL group showed increased FC 
     of the left temporal lobe. However, changes in behavioral outcome 
     measures were non-significant among the 3 groups (all P's > .05). 
     Conclusions. This study highlights the distinct neuroplastic 
     mechanisms associated with 2 types of exercise-cognitive hybridized 
     trainings. The pre-post functional magnetic resonance imaging 
     measurements illustrated the time course of neural mechanisms for 
     cognitive recovery in stroke survivors following different 
     exercise-cognitive training approaches.]

     AB: Background: Ankle fractures are common orthopaedic injuries that 
     may be indicated for open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). 
     Although the negative impact of tobacco use on perioperative outcomes 
     of ankle fracture ORIF has been described, the potential impact of 
     cannabis use on related outcomes is not as well established. Methods: 
     Retrospective database study of adult patients undergoing ankle ORIF 
     for closed, isolated, ankle fractures from the 2010-2021 Q1 
     PearlDiver M151 data set. Subcohorts without and with cannabis and/or 
     tobacco use were identified based on coding and matched based on 
     patient age, sex, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores to 
     yield groups of nonusers, tobacco users, tobacco and cannabis users, 
     and cannabis users. Ninety-day adverse events were assessed between 
     matched subcohorts with multivariable logistic regression controlling 
     for age, sex, and ECI. Results: A total of 149 289 patients met study 
     inclusion criteria for whom tobacco only use was documented for 14 
     989 (10.0%), tobacco and cannabis use for 2726 (1.8%), and cannabis 
     only use for 867 (0.6%). Matching yielded 823 for each group. On 
     multivariable analyses, isolated tobacco users were at higher odds of 
     90-day urinary tract infections (UTIs) (odds ratio [OR] 2.64), minor 
     adverse events (OR 2.33), all-cause adverse events (OR 2.17), 
     readmissions (OR 1.85), and severe adverse events (OR 1.84). Tobacco 
     and cannabis comorbid users were at a marginally higher odds of 
     90-day UTI (OR 2.82), minor adverse events (OR 2.51), readmissions 
     (OR 2.39), and any adverse events (OR 2.22). Cannabis only users were 
     not at greater odds of 90-day adverse events relative to nonusers. 
     Conclusion: Patients with tobacco use (alone or with cannabis) were 
     at greater odds of 90-day adverse events following ankle fracture 
     ORIF, but cannabis only users were not.]

     IS: 1071-1007]
     MD: AB]
     AB: Background: Subluxation at the subtalar joint is one of the major 
     radiographic features that characterize progressive collapsing foot 
     deformity (PCFD). Although it is recognized that the cervical 
     ligament plays an important function in maintaining the subtalar 
     joint's stability, its role and involvement in PCFD is largely 
     unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of 
     cervical ligament insufficiency in patients with PCFD and to 
     establish if the degree of its pathology changes with increasing 
     axial plane deformity. Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed 
     magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 78 PCFD patients and age- and 
     gender-matched controls. The structures evaluated were the cervical, 
     spring, and talocalcaneal interosseous ligaments. Structural 
     derangement was graded on a 5-part scale (0-4), with grade 0 being 
     normal and grade 4 indicating a tear of greater than 50% of the 
     cross-sectional area. Plain radiographic parameters (talonavicular 
     coverage angle [TNC], lateral talo-first metatarsal [Meary] angle, 
     calcaneal pitch, and hindfoot moment arm) as well as axial plane 
     orientation of the talus (TM-Tal) and calcaneus (TM-Calc) relative to 
     the transmalleolar axis and talocalcaneal subluxation (Diff Calc-Tal) 
     were correlated with the cervical ligament MRI grading system. 
     Results: The overall distribution of the degree of cervical ligament 
     involvement was significantly different between the PCFD and control 
     groups (P < .001). MRI evidence of a tear in the cervical ligament 
     was identified in 47 of 78 (60.3%) feet in the PCFD group, which was 
     significantly higher than the control group (10.9%) and comparable to 
     that of superomedial spring (43.6%) and talocalcaneal interosseous 
     (44.9%) ligaments. Univariate ordinal logistic regression modeling 
     demonstrated a predictive ability of TM-Calc (odds ratio [OR] 1.17, 
     95% CI 1.06-1.30, P = .004), Diff Calc-Tal (OR 1.15, 95% CI 
     1.06-1.26, P = .002), TNC (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.13, P = .003), and 
     Meary angle (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.10, P = .006) in determining 
     higher cervical ligament grade on MRI. Conclusion: This study found 
     that cervical ligament insufficiency is more often than not 
     associated with PCFD, and that an increasing axial plane deformity 
     appears to be associated with a greater degree of insufficiency.]

     AB: Background: Midfoot fractures and dislocations are infrequent and 
     functional outcomes following Lisfranc injuries have not been well 
     described. The purpose of this project was to explore functional 
     outcomes following operative treatment of high-energy Lisfranc 
     injury. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 46 adults with 
     tarsometatarsal fractures and dislocations treated at a single Level 
     1 trauma center were reviewed. Demographic, medical, social, and 
     injury features of these patients and their injuries were recorded. 
     Foot Function Index (FFI) and Short Musculoskeletal Function 
     Assessment (SMFA) surveys were collected after mean 8.7 years' 
     follow-up. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify 
     independent predictors of outcome. Results: Forty-six patients with 
     mean age 39.7 years completed functional outcome surveys. Mean SMFA 
     scores were 29.3 (dysfunction) and 32.6 (bothersome). Mean FFI scores 
     were 43.1 (pain), 43.0 (disability), and 21.7 (activity), with a mean 
     total score of 35.9. FFI pain scores were worse than published values 
     for fractures of the plafond (33, P = .04), distal tibia (33, P = 
     .04), and talus (25.3, P = .001). Lisfranc injury patients reported 
     worse disability (43.0 vs 29, P = .008) and total FFI scores (35.9 vs 
     26, P = .02) compared with distal tibia fractures. Tobacco smoking 
     was an independent predictor of worse FFI (P < .05) and SMFA emotion 
     and bothersome scores (P < .04). Chronic renal disease was a 
     predictor of worse FFI disability (P = .04) and SMFA subcategory 
     scores (P < .04). Male sex was associated with better scores in all 
     SMFA categories (P < .04). Age, obesity, or open injury did not 
     affect functional outcomes. Conclusion: Patients reported worse pain 
     by FFI after Lisfranc injury compared to other injuries about the 
     foot and ankle. Tobacco smoking, female sex, and preexisting chronic 
     renal disease are predictive of worse functional outcome scores, 
     warranting further study in a larger sample, as well as counseling of 
     long-term consequences of this injury.]

     AB: Background: Persistent posttraumatic/postsurgery ankle edema 
     (PPAE) is edema that persists from 2 weeks to 3 months after injury 
     or surgery. PPAE has negative effects on the healing process and 
     quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a 
     phytochemical product containing diosmin, coumarin, and arbutin 
     (Linfadren) in addition to the conventional treatment, in patients 
     with PPAE. Methods: Between October 2018 and February 2020, 60 
     outpatients with PPAE (42 with ankle fractures and 18 with ankle 
     sprains) were enrolled and randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive either 
     6-week conventional treatment plus Linfadren (study group) or 
     conventional treatment alone (control group). Primary outcome was 
     ankle edema as measured by the "figure-of-8-20" method. Secondary 
     outcomes were ankle function measured by the Lower Extremity 
     Functional Scale (LEFS), and patient's overall perceived treatment 
     efficacy. Tolerability of Linfadren was also evaluated. Assessments 
     were performed at baseline, at end of treatment (6 weeks after 
     baseline), and 3 months after the end of treatment (follow-up). A 
     subgroup analysis was also conducted for the injury type 
     (fracture/sprain) to identify if this factor affected the results of 
     the primary outcome measure. Results: At the end of treatment, the 
     study group had a significantly greater improvement in ankle edema, 
     improved ankle function, and more patients who considered this 
     treatment effective compared with the control group. The measured 
     difference in circumference by the figure-of-8-20 method averaged 4% 
     at 6 weeks and 5% at 3 months. No difference between groups was seen 
     in rescue medication. No adverse events were recorded. Subgroup 
     analysis revealed no significant influence of the injury type on the 
     primary outcome measure. Conclusion: Linfadren in addition to 
     conventional treatment was more effective than conventional treatment 
     alone in patients with PPAE.]

     AB: Background: Outcome reports for Alpha Ankle Arthroplasty (AAA), a 
     third-generation implant relying on a mobile bearing design for total 
     ankle replacement, are sparse. This retrospective study evaluated the 
     midterm survivorship, clinical, and radiologic outcomes after 
     implantation of this implant. Methods: For 64 patients who received 
     65 Triple A ankle implants between 2009 and 2020, implant survival 
     was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier curve. Clinical outcomes were 
     evaluated by measuring the range of motion, stability, Western 
     Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Questionnaire score 
     (WOMAC), and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot 
     score (AOFAS). The average pain level and satisfaction with the 
     postoperative result were rated on a numeric rating scale (0-10). 
     Additionally, radiologic analysis was performed using anteroposterior 
     and lateral radiographs and tibiotalar alignment was assessed. 
     Results: The implant-survival rate was 61.5% at a mean follow-up of 
     8.2 years. Twenty-five patients (38.5%) required revision surgery 
     (average time to revision, 3.1 years, 95% CI 2.1-4.1 years). For 
     patients without revisions, the average range of motion in 
     dorsiflexion and plantarflexion were 3.6 ± 4.2 degrees and 21.9 ± 
     7.8 degrees, respectively. The mean WOMAC and AOFAS scores were 44.7 
     ± 47.5 and 75.1 ± 14.0, respectively. The average pain and 
     subjective satisfaction scores were 2.0 ± 1.7 and 8.5 ± 1.9, 
     respectively. Mean alignment values did not differ significantly for 
     patients who required revision surgery. Conclusion: We found a high 
     revision rate with use of the AAA. However, patients who did not 
     require revision surgery had, on average, high satisfaction and good 
     functional outcomes.]

     mild to moderate and severe hallux valgus (HV) treated with minimally 
     invasive distal metatarsal transverse osteotomy (MITO) performed by a 
     single surgeon. Methods: Eighty-four patients who underwent MITO 
     between May 2018 and March 2020 were recruited and followed for at 
     least 24 months. The severe group was defined as having a 
     preoperative hallux valgus angle (HVA) >40 degrees or preoperative 
     first-to-second intermetatarsal angle (1-2 IMA) >16 degrees; the mild 
     to moderate group was defined as having an HVA <40 degrees and a 1-2 
     IMA <16 degrees. Pre- and postoperative measurements of the HVA, 1-2 
     IMA, distal metatarsal articular angle, and tibial sesamoid position 
     were obtained. The visual analog scale for pain, the Foot and Ankle 
     Outcome Score, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health 
     Survey-36 physical component summary were used to assess clinical 
     outcomes. Results: A total of 116 feet were included in this study 
     and median follow-up period of 29.0 months (range, 24-52 months). 
     Both groups showed significant improvements in all radiologic 
     parameters postoperatively, with the degrees of correction greater in 
     the severe group than in the mild to moderate group. All clinical 
     scores improved significantly from the preoperative to the last 
     follow-up visit. Final clinical outcomes and degrees of improvement 
     were comparable in both groups. Conclusion: This study showed that 
     short-term radiographic results for patients with either mild to 
     moderate or severe HV treated with MITO were favorable. Overall 
     clinical outcomes were comparable to those of conventional 
     treatments. In this series, we found MITO with screw fixation to be a 
     satisfactory surgical option for patients with mild to severe HV 
     deformities.]

     AB: Background: Retrograde drilling remains technically challenging, 
     because of the difficulty of identifying the accurate location of 
     cysts during surgery. This study's aim was to evaluate the 
     3-dimensional (3D) image-based surgical navigation-assisted 
     endoscopic retrograde drilling technique for subchondral bone lesions 
     of the talus. Methods: From March 2017 to June 2020, a total of 21 
     cases with Hepple stage V subchondral bone lesions of the talus were 
     treated with 3D image-based surgical navigation-assisted endoscopic 
     retrograde drilling and bone graft technique. Arthroscopic views were 
     categorized per Pritsch classifications. The correlation between the 
     drilled tunnel with preoperative cystic lesions were assessed under 
     postoperative computer tomographic (CT) scans. The American 
     Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, visual analog scale 
     (VAS) scores, and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) sports scales 
     were evaluated at the preoperative and final consultation. All 
     complications were recorded. Results: On postoperative CT scans, in 
     20 cases (95.2%), the drilled tunnel was judged to have been in the 
     center of previous cysts. Only 9 cases (42.9%) showed intact normal 
     cartilage (grade 0, group A); 12 cases (57.1%) had intact, but soft, 
     cartilage (grade I, group B). The median follow-up time was 24 (24, 
     30) months, and at final follow-up, there were no significant 
     differences between the mean AOFAS and VAS scores in both groups

     AB: Background: Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a benign 
     proliferative disease affecting synovial membranes. There are 2 
     forms, localized (L-TGCT) and diffuse (D-TGCT), which although 
     histologically similar behave differently. It is locally invasive and 
     is treated in most cases by operative excision. The aim of this study 
     was to assess current practice, how the patients' presentation 
     affected their outcome, as well as review the recurrence rates and 
     complications. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 123 cases was 
     performed in patients treated between 2003 and 2019 with TGCT of the 
     foot and/or ankle. Data were collected on age at presentation, 
     radiologic pattern of disease, location of disease, treatment 
     provided, and recurrence rates. The minimum follow-up was 2 years 
     with a mean of 7.7 years. Results: There were 61.7% female patients 
     with a mean age of 39 (range, 11-76) years. L-TGCT accounted for 85 
     (69.1%) cases and D-TGCT for 38 (30.9%). The most prevalent 
     preoperative symptoms were a palpable mass (78/123) and pain 
     (65/123). Radiologically confirmed recurrence in the operative group 
     was noted in 14.5% (16/110) cases. This comprised 4% (3/75) of 
     operatively treated L-TGCT and 37% (13/35) of operatively treated 
     D-TGCT. Patients with pain on presentation and those with erosive 
     changes on presenting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were more 
     likely to have persistent postoperative pain (P < .001 for both). 
     Where patients had both preoperative pain and erosive changes, 57.1% 
     had postoperative pain. Thirteen cases were managed nonoperatively 
     where symptoms were minimal, with 1 case requiring surgery at a later 
     date. Conclusion: Outcomes of TGCT management are dependent on the 
     disease type, extent of preoperative erosive changes, and presence of 
     preoperative pain. These data are useful for counseling patients 
     regarding the outcomes of surgical intervention and help guide the 
     timing of intervention.]

     AB: Background: The use of 3D-printed endoprosthesis has been 
     proposed as a viable limb-salvage procedure following total 
     calcanectomy in patients with calcaneal malignancy. However, certain 
     drawbacks persist concerning the prosthetic design. In this case 
     series, we designed a modular endoprosthesis incorporating a novel 
     drainage system, aiming to improve the functional outcomes and to 
     promote wound healing. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients 
     with calcaneal malignancy who underwent 3D-printed modular 
     endoprosthesis reconstruction. Clinically, we evaluated functional 
     outcomes using the 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) score, the 1993 
     version of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS-93) score, and the 
     American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score. 
     Complications were also recorded. Results: Five male patients met the 
     final inclusion criteria. The median age was 20 years (range 13-47 
     years). The median follow-up time was 28 months (range, 13-65 
     months). Median postoperative functional MSTS-93, VAS, and AOFAS 
     scores were 27 points (range, 25-29), 0 points (range, 0-1), and 86 
     points (range, 83-93), respectively. Wound healing was observed in 
     all patients, and there were no complications related to the 
     endoprosthesis at the last follow-up. Conclusion: The use of 
     3D-printed modular endoprosthesis was associated with satisfactory 
     short-term outcomes in patients undergoing calcaneal reconstruction. 
     The incorporation of a novel design featuring an integrated draining 
     system has the potential to enhance wound healing and expedite 
     functional recovery.]

     AB: Background: Open repair of the Achilles tendon carries a risk of 
     wound complications and infection. The Achilles tendon is covered by 
     a thin layer of skin and subcutaneous tissue, which has a fragile 
     blood supply. The full plantarflexion position may cause sustained 
     blanching of the skin above the Achilles tendon. However, no reports 
     have described the in vivo blood flow (BF) changes at the skin 
     surface with ankle position. This study aimed to use laser Doppler 
     flowmetry to evaluate the in vivo BF at the skin surface and thereby 
     clarify the changes in BF with ankle position. Methods: The study 
     cohort comprised 30 feet in 15 participants with no history of 
     Achilles tendon rupture. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure 
     the BF at the skin surface above the medial Achilles tendon in the 
     natural plantarflexion (NP) and full plantarflexion (FP) positions. 
     Results: In the NP and FP positions, the BF at 5 cm proximal to the 
     calcaneal insertion (frequent site of Achilles tendon rupture) was 
     1.50 ± 0.32 and 0.97 ± 0.28 mL/min/100 g, respectively (P < .0001). 
     Conclusion: The BF at the skin surface adjacent to the medial 
     Achilles tendon at 5 cm proximal to the calcaneal insertion was 
     significantly less in the FP position than the NP position.]

     AB: Background: To propose and validate a modified noninvasive method 
     for the diagnosis of chronic syndesmotic injuries. Methods: This 
     study included 16 patients with chronic ankle instability. Herein, we 
     propose the Modified Stabilization Test, a new measurement for use in 
     the diagnosis of chronic syndesmotic injury, as determined by wearing 
     a 60-kPa pneumatic brace. The test combines the center of pressure 
     and sensory organization test to measure postural control. For 
     comparison, we also measured the tibiofibular clear space, 
     tibiofibular overlap, and medial clear space using anteroposterior 
     radiograph; a line marked horizontally above the tibial plaque using 
     computed tomography (CT) to measure the syndesmotic gap and fibular 
     rotation angle; and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to 
     determine the presence of the λ sign. The distance of syndesmosis 
     was confirmed in 16 individuals through arthroscopy, and the results 
     of the examination were used to determine the diagnostic efficacy of 
     each index. Results: Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis 
     revealed that the optimal cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity 
     of the Modified Stabilization Test for the diagnosis of chronic 
     syndesmotic injuries were 0.80, 100%, and 87.5%, respectively. The 
     area under the curve (AUC) of the Modified Stabilization Test was 
     0.906 (95% CI 0.656, 0.993; P < .001), which was superior to imaging 
     indices such as radiography, CT, and MRI (AUC = 0.516-0.891). 
     Conclusion: We developed the Modified Stabilization Test-a 
     noninvasive diagnostic tool for the screening of chronic syndesmotic 
     injuries. The test showed high sensitivity and specificity for the 
     identification of chronic syndesmotic injuries and is helpful in the 
     identification of chronic syndesmotic injuries.]

     MD: AB]
     AB: Background: Transarticular screw fixation is a common surgical 
     treatment for tarsometatarsal ligamentous (Lisfranc) injuries. 
     Iatrogenic damage to articular cartilage from screw placement, 
     however, has been thought to potentially lead to increased risk of 
     tarsometatarsal (TMT) joint arthritis after initial injury. To date, 
     no study has evaluated the effect of weightbearing on articular 
     cartilage after screw fixation. The aim of this study was to create a 
     Lisfranc injury and quantify and compare articular damage due to 
     screw fixation before and after simulated weightbearing. Methods: A 
     ligamentous Lisfranc injury was created in 10 cadaveric specimens and 
     treated with transarticular screws. Specimens were cycled for 1000 
     cycles at 250 N to simulate 2 weeks of physiologic weightbearing. 
     Rotation and diastasis across the Lisfranc complex were measured. 
     Articular injury as a percentage of total articular surface was 
     measured using digital imaging of the first and second TMT joint 
     before and after simulated weightbearing. Comparisons between 
     articular damage were made and statistical analysis was performed. 
     Results: Simulated partial weightbearing increased articular injury 
     1.44-fold (P < .001). The second metatarsal (M2) showed the greatest 
     increase (1.54-fold, P = .0047), whereas the first (M1) showed the 
     least (1.35-fold, P = .0083). Increases seen at the medial 
     (1.43-fold, P = .0387) and middle cuneiform (1.44-fold, P = .0292) 
     were intermediate between the values seen at M2 and M1. Conclusion: 
     Articular damage from transarticular screw fixation significantly 
     increased after simulated partial weightbearing. This may increase 
     the risk of arthritis and future morbidity when using transarticular 
     screws for the treatment of ligamentous Lisfranc injuries.]

     AB: Background: Although hindfoot arthrodeses relieve pain and 
     correct deformity, they have been associated with progressive 
     tibiotalar degeneration. The objective was to quantify changes in 
     tibiotalar kinematics after hindfoot arthrodeses, both isolated 
     subtalar and talonavicular, as well as double arthrodesis, and to 
     determine if the order of joint fixation affects tibiotalar 
     kinematics. Methods: Hindfoot arthrodeses were performed in 14 
     cadaveric mid-tibia specimens. Specimens randomly received isolated 
     fixation of the subtalar or talonavicular joint first, followed by 
     fixation of the remaining joint for the double arthrodesis. A 
     6-degree-of-freedom robot sequentially simulated the stance phase of 
     level walking for intact, isolated, and double arthrodesis 
     conditions. Tibiotalar kinematic changes were compared for the intact 
     and arthrodesis conditions. A subsequent analysis assessed the effect 
     of the joint fixation order on tibiotalar kinematics. Results: 
     Isolated and double hindfoot arthrodeses increased tibiotalar 
     plantarflexion, inversion, and internal rotation during late stance. 
     Tibiotalar kinematics changes occurring after isolated arthrodesis 
     remained consistent after the double arthrodesis for both the 
     subtalar- and talonavicular-first conditions. The order of joint 
     fixation influenced tibiotalar kinematics through some portions of 
     stance, where the talonavicular-first double arthrodesis increased 
     tibiotalar plantarflexion, eversion, and internal rotation compared 
     to the subtalar-first double. Conclusion: Tibiotalar kinematics were 
     modestly altered for all conditions, both isolated and double 
     hindfoot arthrodeses. Changes in tibiotalar kinematics were 
     consistent from the isolated to the double arthrodesis conditions and 
     varied depending on which isolated hindfoot arthrodesis was performed 
     first. Further research is needed to assess the clinical implications 
     of the observed changes in tibiotalar kinematics, particularly as it 
     pertains to the development of adjacent joint arthritis. Clinical 
     Relevance: These findings may correlate with clinical research that 
     has cited hindfoot arthrodesis as a risk factor for adjacent 
     tibiotalar arthritis. Once either the subtalar or talonavicular joint 
     is fused, avoiding the arthrodesis of the second joint may not 
     necessarily protect the tibiotalar joint.]

     MD: AB]
     AB: Background: Evans (E-LCL) and Hintermann LCL (H-LCL) lateral 
     column lengthening osteotomies are standard surgical solutions for 
     flexible, progressive collapsing feet. E-LCL is performed between the 
     anterior and middle facets and endangers specific os calcis subtalar 
     joint (OCST) subtypes without distinct facets. H-LCL is oriented 
     between the posterior and middle facets and should be suitable for 
     all OCSTs. Both osteotomies are associated with increased subtalar 
     osteoarthritis, indicating iatrogenic damage. Distance mapping (DM) 
     enables visualization of the relative distance between 2 articular 
     surfaces represented by color patterns. This study aims to measure 
     the safe zones for LCL using 3-dimensional (3D) models and DM; we 
     hypothesize that it could be measured with high reproducibility. 
     Methods: Two raters categorized 200 feet across 134 patients into 
     OCSTs based on the Bruckner classification. Four angles were measured 
     independently. The proximal and distal extents of the posterior safe 
     zone (PSZ) angles were determined for H-LCL osteotomies; similarly, 
     the proximal and distal extents of the anterior safe zone (ASZ) 
     angles were identified for E-LCL osteotomies. Consequently, the 
     surface available for safe osteotomies were calculated. An interclass 
     correlation was used to assess the agreement between the 2 raters. 
     Additionally, analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U test were used 
     to compare the safe zones between OCSTs. Results: The mean proximal 
     and distal extents of the PSZ angles were 68 ± 7 and 75 ± 5 degrees 
     from a line parallel to the lateral border of the calcaneus, 
     respectively, and the proximal and distal extent of the ASZ angles 
     were 89 ± 6 and 95 ± 5 degrees, respectively. There were no 
     statistically significant differences between the OCSTs. Two raters 
     measured the angles with good to excellent interrater and intrarater 
     agreement. In 18 cases, we were unable to plan for H-LCL or E-LCL 
     osteotomies. Conclusion: Distance mapping could be used to measure 
     the safe zone, tailor a preoperative plan, and potentially reduce the 
     risk for iatrogenic damage in LCL. 3D models and DM can increase the 
     reliability of preoperative plans in bones with complex 3D 
     structures.]

     AB: Background: Evidence from prospective short-term studies suggest 
     that proximal medial gastrocnemius recession is a safe and efficient 
     procedure to treat chronic plantar fasciitis resistant to 
     nonoperative treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
     long-term clinical outcomes of proximal medial gastrocnemius 
     recession and stretching compared to a stretching exercise protocol 
     for patients with chronic plantar fasciitis and an isolated 
     gastrocnemius contracture (IGC). Methods: Forty patients with plantar 
     fasciitis lasting more than 1 year were prospectively randomized to a 
     home stretching exercise program only, or to proximal medial 
     gastrocnemius recession in addition to the stretching program. 
     Clinical and functional data in this study were obtained at baseline 
     and 6-year follow-up. The main outcome was the American Orthopaedic 
     Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score. Secondary outcomes 
     were the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the Manchester Oxford 
     Foot Questionnaire (MOxFQ), ankle dorsiflexion, and Achilles complex 
     performance. Results: Thirty-three of 40 patients completed the 
     6-year follow-up. Seven patients had crossed over from nonoperative 
     treatment to operative treatment. At 6 years, the operative group 
     demonstrated significantly better outcomes with AOFAS (88.9 vs 78.6, 
     P = .012), for pain measured by VAS (2.5 vs 5.5, P < .001) and with 
     the MOxFQ total score (24.4 vs 45.9, P = .05) (per protocol analysis 
     excluding crossovers). No between-group differences were observed for 
     ankle dorsiflexion or Achilles complex performance at 6 years. 
     Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the improved function and 
     reduced level of pain by proximal medial gastrocnemius recession and 
     stretching is better compared to stretching alone after 6 years of 
     follow-up for patients with chronic plantar fasciitis and a 
     concomitant isolated gastrocnemius contracture.]

     AB: Background: Ankle arthritis leads to an elevated joint line 
     compared to the nonarthritic ankle, as measured by the "joint line 
     height ratio" (JLHR). Previous work has shown that the JLHR may 
     remain elevated after total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). However, the 
     clinical impact of this has yet to be determined. This study assessed 
     the correlation between postoperative JLHR, post-TAA range of motion 
     (ROM), and 1-year Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information 
     System (PROMIS) scores. Methods: A retrospective review of 150 
     patients who underwent primary TAA was performed. Preoperative and 
     postoperative JLHR, as well as postoperative dorsiflexion, 
     plantarflexion, and total ROM, was calculated on weightbearing 
     radiographs at a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Correlation between 
     JLHR, post-TAA ROM, and 1-year PROMIS scores was investigated using 
     Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression models. 
     Interobserver reliability for the JLHR was also calculated. Results: 
     Interobserver reliability for the JLHR was excellent (r = 0.98). Mean 
     (SD) JLHR changed from 1.66 (0.45) to 1.55 (0.26) after TAA (P < 
     .001), indicating that the joint line was lowered after TAA. An 
     elevated joint line was correlated with decreased post-TAA 
     dorsiflexion (r = −0.26, P < .001), total ROM (r = −0.18, P = 
     .025), and worse 1-year PROMIS physical function (r = −0.22, P = 
     .046), pain intensity (r = 0.22, P = .042), and pain interference (r 
     = 0.29, P = .007). There was no correlation between the JLHR and 
     post-TAA plantarflexion (r = −0.025, P = .76). Regression analysis 
     identified a 0.5-degree reduction in post-TAA dorsiflexion with each 
     0.1-unit increase in JLHR (Coeff. = −5.13, P = .005). Conclusion: 
     In this patient cohort, we found that an elevated joint line modestly 
     correlated with decreased postoperative dorsiflexion, total ROM, and 
     worse 1-year PROMIS scores. These data suggest that effort likely 
     should be made toward restoring the native joint line at the time of 
     TAA. In addition, future studies investigating the clinical outcomes 
     after TAA may consider including a measure of joint line height, such 
     as the JLHR, because we found it was associated with patient-reported 
     outcomes.]

     ankles, and the TTJL post-TAA remains elevated compared with 
     nonarthritic ankles. The objectives of this study were to (1) propose 
     a reliable radiographic method to measure the TTJL absolute value and 
     (2) determine the effect of TTJL alterations on tibiotalar range of 
     motion (ROM) following TAA. Methods: A retrospective review was 
     performed on patients who underwent TAA between January 2018 and 
     April 2021 with a minimum of 1-year postoperative follow-up and 
     complete perioperative ROM radiographs. Radiographic TTJL and ROM 
     measurements were performed by 2 observers. The proposed TTJL 
     measuring technique computes 4 measurements: high, low, center of the 
     talus (center), and center of the axis (axis). Reliability of 
     measurements and correlation between TTJL measurements and ROM were 
     assessed. Results: A total of 33 patients were included. 
     Postoperatively, 22 patients had a lowered TTJL compared to 11 
     patients with an elevated TTJL (2.2 ± 1.3 mm lowered vs 1.9 ± 1.2 
     mm elevated; P < .0001). Of the 4 TTJL measurements, 3 (low, center, 
     axis) demonstrated a significant positive correlation between 
     lowering the TTJL and improved tibiotalar dorsiflexion and 2 (low, 
     axis) for total ROM (all P < .05). Plantarflexion was not 
     significantly affected by TTJL alterations. Compared to patients with 
     an elevated TTJL, patients with a lowered TTJL had improved 
     tibiotalar dorsiflexion (8.8 vs 2.5 degrees; P = .0015) and total ROM 
     (31.0 vs 22.9 degrees; P = .0191), respectively. The interrater 
     reliability was nearly perfect (intraclass correlation r = 
     0.96-0.99). Conclusion: In this small series, we found that lowering 
     the TTJL level may more closely reestablish the native TTJL and 
     correlates with improved tibiotalar dorsiflexion and total ROM 
     following TAA.]

     AB: Background: Malunion of tibial pilon fracture, especially with a 
     large cartilage loss of the tibial plafond, is a tough clinical 
     conundrum. This study describes a joint-preserving technique that 
     mainly involves corrective intraarticular osteotomy and 
     osteoperiosteal iliac autograft transplantation for treating these 
     generally considered unreconstructable tibial plafond. Methods: 
     Sixteen patients with an average age of 33.6 years who were treated 
     with this joint-preserving method between 2013 and 2020 were 
     retrospectively analyzed. Ankle distraction was applied in all 
     patients. Additional osteochondral autograft transplantation for 
     talus was performed in 4 patients and supramalleolar osteotomy in 2 
     patients. The visual analog scale (VAS) score, the American 
     Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score, the 
     36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) score, and the ankle range 
     of motion (ROM) were used for outcome analysis. Radiographic 
     assessment was conducted, and the complications were recorded. 
     Results: At a mean follow-up of 41.1 months, the mean VAS, AOFAS, and 
     SF-36 scores improved from 6.3, 47.6, and 38.0 to 1.7, 84.4, and 
     70.8, respectively (P < .001 for each). The ankle ROM improved from 
     27.5 to 32.2 degrees (P = .023). The mean area of ilium blocks was 
     3.5 cm2, and the mean external fixation time was 94.1 days. 
     Radiographs showed that good osteointegration was found in all 
     patients and no significant progression of osteoarthritis in 15 
     patients. The major complications included poor incision healing in 2 
     patients and severe ankle stiffness in 2 patients, with one of them 
     developing considerable varus-type osteoarthritis but reporting no 
     pain. No deep infection, nonunion, or malunion occurred, and no 
     secondary arthrodesis was performed during the final follow-up. 
     Conclusion: Osteoperiosteal iliac autograft transplantation might be 
     an alternative surgical option for reconstructing unreconstructable 
     malunited pilon fractures with a large cartilage loss of the tibial 
     plafond in young patients.]

     MD: AB]
     AB: Background: The transverse arch (TA) has recently been shown to 
     significantly increase the intrinsic stiffness of the midfoot when 
     coupled with the medial longitudinal arch (MLA). Progressive 
     collapsing foot deformity (PCFD) is a complex deformity that 
     ultimately results in a loss of stiffness and collapse of the MLA. 
     The role of the TA has not been investigated in patients diagnosed 
     with this disorder using weightbearing CT (WBCT). Therefore, this 
     study aims to answer the following questions: (1) Is the curvature of 
     the TA decreased in PCFD? (2) Where within the midfoot does TA 
     curvature flattening happen in PCFD?. Methods: A retrospective review 
     of weightbearing CT images was conducted for 32 PCFD and 32 control 
     feet. The TA curvature was assessed both indirectly using previously 
     described methods and directly using a novel measurement termed the 
     transverse arch plantar (TAP) angle that assesses the angle formed 
     between the first, second, and fifth metatarsals in the coronal 
     plane. Location of TA collapse was also assessed in the coronal 
     plane. Results: The TAP angle was significantly higher in PCFD (mean 
     115.2 degrees, SD 10.7) than in the control group (mean 100.8 
     degrees, SD 7.9) (P < .001). No difference was found using the 
     calculated normalized TA curvature between PCFD (mean 17.1, SD 4.8) 
     and controls (mean 18.3, SD 4.0) (P = .266). Location of collapse 
     along the TA in PCFD was most significant at the second metatarsal 
     and medial cuneiform. Conclusion: The TA is more collapsed in PCFD 
     compared to controls. This collapse was most substantial between the 
     plantar medial cuneiform and the plantar second metatarsal. This may 
     represent a location of uncoupling of the TA and MLA.]

     AB: Background: Intraoperative fracture of the lateral cortex is 
     common during Akin osteotomy. In a recent study, lateral cortex 
     fracture did not impede healing or result in loss of correction in a 
     combined cohort of open and percutaneous osteotomies stabilized by 
     K-wire fixation. We hypothesize that undesired lateral cortex 
     fracture will not affect radiographic correction and patient-reported 
     outcomes in a percutaneous cohort stabilized by permanent, rigid 
     screw fixation. Methods: Consecutive patients with hallux valgus who 
     underwent first metatarsal osteotomy and percutaneous Akin osteotomy 
     stabilized by permanent, rigid screw fixation between May 2020 and 
     January 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified 
     based on fractured lateral cortex (FC) or its absence (nonfractured 
     cortex [NFC]). Visual analog scale (VAS) and Foot Function Index 
     (FFI) were used to assess pain and patient-reported outcomes at 
     1-year follow-up. Patients were polled for satisfaction at 1-year 
     follow-up by yes/no survey. Results: Ninety-eight patients (89% 
     female) were reviewed (98 feet; 43 NFC, 55 FC). Mean age was 48.3 
     years (range, 18-83 years). Mean preoperative VAS score was 7.5 and 
     7.7 in NFC and FC groups, which significantly decreased to 0.6 (P < 
     .01) and 0.6 (P < .01), respectively. Mean total FFI was 53.9 and 
     54.2 and decreased to 17.9 (P < .01) and 17.2 (P < .01) in the NFC 
     group and FC group, respectively. Overall, 97.8% of the NFC group and 
     96.4% of the FC group reported satisfaction. Mean HVA improved from 
     27.2 (16-42) degrees to 10.7 degrees (4-12) postoperatively in the 
     NFC group. And in the FC group, HVA improved from 29.3 (19-39) 
     degrees to 7.1 (4-12) degrees postoperatively. Postoperative HVA was 
     significantly lower in the FC group (P < .05). Conclusion: In an 
     exclusively percutaneous surgical cohort with correction maintained 
     by rigid screw fixation, fracture of the lateral cortex is associated 
     with improved postoperative radiologic alignment without detriment to 
     patient-reported outcomes.]

     arthroplasty (TAA) nationwide, there are few studies comparing 
     flat-cut vs chamfer-cut talar systems in TAA with regard to 
     radiographic aseptic loosening rates of the implant. Methods: This 
     retrospective study included 189 Salto-Talaris TAA and 132 INBONE II 
     primary TAA with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Patient characteristics 
     were obtained including gender, age at surgery, body mass index 
     (BMI), smoking status, primary diagnosis, surgical time, and the 
     presence of diabetes. Radiographic evidence for aseptic loosening was 
     assessed. Statistical analysis was performed for comparison in 
     outcomes between Salto-Talaris and INBONE II. Results: The mean age 
     of the study population was 63.5 ± 9.8 years at surgery. Mean 
     follow-up was 4.9 ± 3.0 years. Radiographic aseptic loosening of the 
     tibial implant showed no significant difference between the 2 groups: 
     Salto-Talaris, 18%, and INBONE II, 18.9% (P = .829). Aseptic 
     loosening of the talar implant also showed no significant difference 
     between the 2 groups: Salto-Talaris, 1.6%, and INBONE II, 1.5% (P = 
     .959). No variables, including the implant type, were found to 
     contribute to the aseptic loosening rate of either the tibia or 
     talus. Conclusion: In our cohort, we observed no difference in 
     radiographic implant aseptic loosening between Salto-Talaris and 
     INBONE II systems.]

     AB: Background: Nicotine is a modifiable risk factor that is well 
     demonstrated to cause deleterious effects on tendon healing and 
     overall health. Individuals that have a dependence on nicotine may be 
     at an elevated risk for numerous postoperative complications when 
     compared to nondependent patients. The purpose of this study is to 
     evaluate the complications postoperatively between nicotine- and 
     non-nicotine-dependent Achilles tendon repairs. Methods: The global 
     health network database, TriNetX, was used to access and analyze 
     deidentified patient information. Two cohorts were identified for the 
     purposes of this study. Cohort A was defined as patients who had an 
     Achilles tendon repair (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT]: 27650 
     or CPT: 27654) and had a dependence to nicotine (International 
     Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code: F17). Cohort B was 
     defined as patients who had an Achilles tendon repair but did not 
     have a dependence to nicotine. Data were gathered from health care 
     organizations from August 21, 2000, to August 21, 2023. All 
     postoperative complications were analyzed between 1 and 90 days after 
     the Achilles tendon repair. Results: A total of 2117 
     nicotine-dependent patients were matched with 18 102 
     non-nicotine-dependent patients. After propensity matching for age at 
     event, ethnicity, race, sex, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
     nicotine-dependent patients who underwent Achilles tendon repair 
     experienced higher associated risk for numerous postoperative 
     complications. When compared to nondependent patients, 
     nicotine-dependent patients had increased risk for wound disruption 
     (risk ratio [RR] 1.55, 95% CI 1.11-2.16) and infection following a 
     procedure (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.09-2.47) within 90 days post Achilles 
     tendon repair. Conclusion: In this database study using propensity 
     matching, nicotine-dependent patients who underwent Achilles tendon 
     repair were correlated with an increased associated risk for wound 
     disruption and infection after a procedure than their 
     non-nicotine-dependent counterpart.]

     AB: Background: A reliable landmark and precise distances from the 
     ligament attachments are needed for lateral ankle stabilization 
     surgery. The distal fascicle of the anterior inferior tibiofibular 
     ligament (AITFL) has been used to locate the anterior talofibular 
     ligament (ATFL) or calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) centers on the 
     fibula. However, there is no anatomic study to validate the distal 
     fascicle of the AITFL as a landmark of lateral ankle ligament 
     stabilization, and more importantly, the exact distances from the 
     ATFL or CFL attachments to the distal fascicle of the AITFL are 
     unknown. Methods: Sixteen frozen cadaveric specimens (8 paired 
     specimens) with no previous history of ankle injury were used in this 
     study. Whether the distal fascicle of AITFL was present in each 
     specimen was confirmed. Then, the distances from the most distal 
     insertion of the AITFL's distal fascicle to the footprint centers of 
     the ATFL and CFL on the fibula were measured. All measurements were 
     performed by 2 observers, and the intraobserver and interobserver 
     reliabilities were analyzed by intraclass correlation coefficients 
     (ICCs). Results: The distal fascicle of the AITFL was found in all 
     specimens (100%). The mean distance from the most distal insertion of 
     the AITFL's distal fascicle to the footprint centers of the ATFL, 
     CFL, and the intersection center of the 2 ligaments on the fibula was 
     6.0 to 7.1 mm, 11.5 to 13.2 mm, and 9.0 to 10.0 mm, respectively. 
     Excellent interobserver and intraobserver agreement (all ICCs > 0.9, 
     P < .01) was shown in the anatomic measurements of these distances. 
     Conclusion: In this cadaveric study, we found that the distal 
     fascicle was a constant structure of the AITFL in the lateral ankle. 
     The distances from the most distal insertion of the AITFL's distal 
     fascicle to the ligamentous footprint centers were reliable and may 
     be used to identify the origins of the ATFL and CFL for lateral ankle 
     ligament reconstruction.]

     AB: Background: The diagnosis and treatment of distal tibiofibular 
     syndesmosis (DTFS) injury can be challenging, especially in cases of 
     subtle instability that may be masked on 2-dimensional conventional 
     radiographs. Weightbearing computed tomography (WBCT) has recently 
     emerged as a useful diagnostic tool allowing direct assessment of 
     distal tibiofibular area widening. The purpose of the current study 
     was to examine and report normal threshold values for DTFS area 
     measurements in a cohort of healthy volunteers, assessing the ankles 
     in natural weightbearing position and under subject-driven external 
     rotation stress. Methods: In this prospective study, we enrolled 25 
     healthy volunteers without a history of DTFS injury or high ankle 
     sprain, previous foot and ankle surgery, or current ankle pain. 
     Subjects with any prior ankle injuries were excluded. Study 
     participants underwent bilateral standing nonstress and external 
     rotation stress WBCT scans. The DTFS area (mm2) was semiautomatically 
     quantified on axial-plane WBCT images 1 cm proximal to the apex of 
     the talar dome using validated software. Syndesmosis area values were 
     compared between "unstressed" and "stressed" ankles, as well as left 
     and right ankles. Statistical analysis was performed using 
     independent t tests/Wilcoxon analysis with statistical significance 
     defined as P <.05. Results: The study cohort consisted of 50 ankles 
     in 25 patients (12 males, 48%) with a mean age of 28.7 ± 9.3 years. 
     In the unstressed ankle, the mean pooled DTFS area was determined to 
     be 103.8 + 20.8 mm2. The mean syndesmosis area of unstressed left 
     ankles (104.2 + 19.5 mm2) was similar to unstressed right ankles 
     (109.2 + 17.2 mm2) in the cohort (P = .117). With external rotation 
     stress, the DTFS area of left ankles (mean difference −0.304 mm2, 
     CI −12.1 to 11.5; P = .082), right ankles (mean difference −5.5 
     mm2, CI 16.7-5.7; P = .132), and all ankles (mean difference −2.9 
     mm2, CI −10.8 to 5.1; P = .324) remained similar. Conclusion: This 
     study presents normal values and range for DTFS area calculation. In 
     uninjured ankles with expected intact ligaments, subject-driven 
     external rotation stress did not result in significant widening of 
     the DTFS space as imaged on with WBCT.]

     AB: Background: There is a lack of consensus in the use of open 
     reduction internal fixation (ORIF) vs primary arthrodesis (PA) in the 
     management of Lisfranc injuries. Statistical fragility represents the 
     number of events needed to flip statistical significance and provides 
     context to interpret P values of outcomes from conflicting studies. 
     The current study evaluates the statistical fragility of existing 
     research with an outcome-specific approach to provide statistical 
     clarity to the ORIF vs PA discussion. We hypothesized that 
     statistical fragility analysis would offer clinically relevant 
     insight when interpreting conflicting outcomes regarding ORIF vs PA 
     management of Lisfranc injuries. Methods: All comparative studies, 
     RCTs, and case-series investigating ORIF vs PA management of Lisfranc 
     injuries published through October 5, 2023, were identified. 
     Descriptive characteristics, dichotomous outcomes, and continuous 
     outcomes were extracted. Fragility index and continuous fragility 
     index were calculated by the number of event reversals needed to 
     alter significance. Outcomes were categorized by clinical relevance, 
     and median FI and CFI were reported. Results: A total of 244 studies 
     were screened. Ten studies and 67 outcomes (44 dichotomous, 23 
     continuous) were included in the fragility analysis. Of the 10 
     studies, 4 studies claimed PA to correlate with superior outcomes 
     compared to ORIF with regard to functional scores and return to 
     function outcomes. Of these 4 studies, 3 were statistically robust. 
     Six studies claimed PA and ORIF to have no differences in outcomes, 
     in which only 2 studies were statistically robust. Conclusion: The 
     overall research regarding ORIF vs PA is relatively robust compared 
     with other orthopaedic areas of controversy. Although the full 
     statistical context of each article must be considered, studies 
     supporting PA superiority with regard to functional scores and return 
     to function metrics were found to be statistically robust. 
     Outcome-specific analysis revealed moderate fragility in several 
     clinically relevant outcomes such as functional score, return to 
     function, and wound complications.]

     AB: Background: Significant heterogeneity in the classification and 
     treatment of zone 3 proximal fifth metatarsal base fractures ("true 
     Jones fractures") exists. This study compared time to clinical and 
     radiographic healing between patients treated operatively and 
     nonoperatively. We hypothesized that patients treated nonoperatively 
     may demonstrate a greater time to clinical healing. Methods: This was 
     a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting to a large, 
     urban, academic medical center with "Jones" fractures between 
     December 2012 and April 2022. Jones fractures were defined as fifth 
     metatarsal base fractures occurring in the proximal metadiaphyseal 
     region, distal to the articulation of the fourth and fifth 
     metatarsals on the oblique radiographic view. Clinical healing was 
     the time point at which the patient had returned to their baseline 
     ambulatory status with no tenderness to palpation. Radiographic 
     healing was the presence of bridging callus across at least 3 
     cortices. Results: A total of 2450 patients presented with fifth 
     metatarsal fractures, and 166 fractures (6.8%) were true Jones 
     fractures. Among patients with Jones fractures, 120 patients with 121 
     Jones fractures followed up at our institution and were included in 
     the analysis (mean age 46.5 ± 18.5 years). Ninety-nine fractures 
     (81.8%) were treated nonoperatively and 22 fractures (18.2%) 
     operatively. There were no differences between nonoperative and 
     operative groups in time to clinical healing (12.7 ± 7.1 vs 12.8 ± 
     4.8 weeks, P = .931) or radiographic healing (13.2 ± 8.1 vs 11.7 ± 
     5.9 weeks, P = .331). Overall healing rate was 96% for the 
     nonoperative group compared with 96.2% for the operative group. 
     Conclusion: In this study, nonoperative and operative treatment of 
     true Jones fractures were associated with equivalent clinical and 
     radiographic healing. The rate of delayed union in true Jones 
     fractures was lower than previously described, and there was no 
     difference in delayed union rate between nonoperative and operative 
     management.]

     AB: Background: Postoperative infection, aseptic loosening, and 
     perioperative medical complications after total ankle arthroplasty 
     (TAA) are all devastating problems. While previous studies have shown 
     diabetes as a risk factor predisposing patients to postoperative 
     complications, not all literature supports this association following 
     TAA. The goal of this study is to determine if diabetes influences 
     midterm outcomes following TAA. Methods: An insurance database was 
     utilized to identify patients undergoing TAA for ankle arthritis with 
     a concurrent diagnosis of diabetes based on Current Procedural 
     Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
     Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10), diagnosis and procedure 
     codes from 2010 to 2021. The postoperative outcomes of all-cause 
     revision, periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), septic revision, and 
     aseptic revision were compared between patients with and without 
     diabetes with a minimum 2-year follow-up using Kaplan-Meier and 
     multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses. Patient demographics, 
     comorbidities, and Charlson Comorbidity Index were analyzed via 
     univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The study population 
     included 8317 patients, 345 (4.1%) of whom had a concurrent diabetes 
     diagnosis, who underwent TAA. After multivariate Cox proportional 
     hazards analysis, the 5-year cumulative incidence of being coded as 
     having PJI was 7.3% in patients with known diabetes compared to 3.9% 
     in patients without known diabetes, with a 95% increased risk (hazard 
     ratio [HR] 1.95, 95% CI 1.15-3.30, P = .01). Patients with diabetes 
     also demonstrated a 5-year cumulative incidence of septic revision of 
     1.4% compared to 0.4% in those without, with a 363% increased risk 
     (HR 4.63, 95% CI 1.22-17.52, P = .02). However, there was no 
     difference in the 5-year cumulative incidence of all-cause revision 
     TAA with 4.6% in patients with diabetes and 4.3% in those without (HR 
     1.29, 95% CI 0.69-2.44, P = .42). Conclusion: In this database, the 
     5-year risk of PJI and septic revision was higher among patients with 
     diabetes compared to those without, but cumulative incidence of 
     all-cause revision TAA was not different between groups.]

     AB: Background: Posttraumatic osteonecrosis (ON) of the lateral 
     distal tibia is a rare but severe complication of malleolar 
     fractures. Treatment options include ankle fusion, arthroplasty, 
     osteotomy, and drilling but clinical data on outcomes are limited to 
     single case reports. The aim of this study was to prospectively 
     evaluate the outcome following joint-preserving reconstruction. 
     Methods: Over a 10-year period, 10 patients (8 females and 2 males, 
     average age 36 years; range, 27-68 years) with posttraumatic ON were 
     treated with intra-articular osteotomy of the distal tibia and bone 
     grafting. All patients initially sustained a closed pronation injury, 
     7 with initial tibiotalar subluxation. Chronic syndesmotic 
     instability following initial treatment was present in 4 patients and 
     5 were smokers. All patients were followed for a median of 68 (range, 
     12-103) months, 7 returned in person for clinical and radiographic 
     follow-up. Results: No immediate postoperative complications were 
     seen. Secondary ankle fusion was necessary in 1 case (10%) because of 
     progressive osteoarthritis. At the time of follow-up, anterior ankle 
     arthritis leading to impingement and requiring cheilectomy was noted 
     in 4 cases, partial graft necrosis, and secondary syndesmotic 
     instability requiring revision surgery was seen in 1 case each. 
     Compared with the preoperative values, significant improvement in the 
     Olerud-Molander Ankle Score (P = .012), EuroQuol-5 Score (P = .008), 
     and Foot Function Index (FFI-D pain, P = .028; FFI-D restriction, P = 
     .038) was seen. Average range of motion at the ankle was 45 degrees. 
     Conclusion: In our limited series of patients with posttraumatic ON 
     of the lateral distal tibia, we found that joint-preserving 
     reconstruction using an intra-articular distal tibial osteotomy with 
     autologous bone grafting usually provided significant functional 
     improvement and pain relief. In our cohort secondary fusions by a 
     median 5.5-year follow-up were rare, but secondary, joint-sparing 
     surgeries were common.]

     AB: Background: Several demographic and clinical risk factors for 
     recurrent ankle instability have been described. The main objective 
     of this study was to investigate the potential influence of 
     morphologic characteristics of the ankle joint on the occurrence of 
     recurrent instability and the functional outcomes following a 
     modified Broström-Gould procedure for chronic lateral ankle 
     instability. Methods: Fifty-eight ankles from 58 patients (28 males 
     and 30 females) undergoing a modified Broström-Gould procedure for 
     chronic lateral ankle instability between January 2014 and July 2021 
     were available for clinical and radiological evaluation. Based on the 
     preoperative radiographs, the following radiographic parameters were 
     measured: talar width (TW), tibial anterior surface (TAS) angle, 
     talar height (TH), talar radius (TR), tibiotalar sector (TTS), and 
     tibial lateral surface (TLS) angle. The history of recurrent ankle 
     instability and the functional outcome using the Karlsson Score were 
     assessed after a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Results: Recurrent 
     ankle instability was reported in 14 patients (24%). The TTS was 
     significantly lower in patients with recurrent ankle instability 
     (69.8 degrees vs 79.3 degrees) (P < .00001). The multivariate 
     logistic regression model confirmed the TTS as an independent risk 
     factor for recurrent ankle instability (OR = 1.64) (P = .003). The 
     receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that 
     patients with a TTS lower than 72 degrees (=low-TTS group) had an 
     82-fold increased risk for recurrent ankle instability (P = .001). 
     The low-TTS group showed a significantly higher rate of recurrent 
     instability (58% vs 8%; P = .0001) and a significantly lower Karlsson 
     score (65 points vs 85 points; P < .00001). Conclusion: A smaller TTS 
     was found to be an independent risk factor for recurrent ankle 
     instability and led to poorer functional outcomes after a modified 
     Broström-Gould procedure.]

     AB: Background: The proposed advantages of hamstring autograft 
     reconstruction when compared to alternative procedures, such as 
     flexor hallucis longus (FHL) transfer, V-Y lengthening, and allograft 
     reconstruction, are improved healing and reproduction of normal 
     tendon biomechanics and reduced morbidity within the foot and ankle. 
     In this study, we examined the effect of Achilles tendon 
     reconstruction using hamstring autografts on strength and functional 
     outcomes. Methods: Patients who underwent Achilles repair with a 
     hamstring autograft for insertional or midsubstance tendinopathy, 
     delayed diagnosis of rupture, or infection after primary repair were 
     evaluated for inclusion. Forty-six patients were identified; 12 
     further augmented with an FHL transfer are included in the analysis. 
     Isokinetic testing was completed with a Biodex dynamometer under 
     supervision of a physical therapist masked to surgical side. Pre- and 
     postoperative Foot and Ankle Outcome Scores (FAOS, before March 2016) 
     or Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS, 
     after March 2016) surveys were collected. Results: For knee flexion, 
     peak torque was not significantly different when comparing operative 
     and nonoperative sides at 180 degrees/second (45.38 Nm vs 45.96 Nm; P 
     = .69) nor at 300 degrees/second (44.2 Nm vs 47.02 Nm; P = .069). 
     Knee extension absolute peak torque was only found to be 
     significantly weaker on the operative side at the faster testing 
     (75.5 Nm vs 79.56 Nm; P < .05). Peak ankle plantarflexion torque was 
     significantly weaker on the operative side at both the slower speed 
     (60 degrees/second: 39.9 Nm vs 48.76 Nm; P < .005) and the faster 
     speed (120 degrees/second: 31.3 Nm vs 40.7 Nm; P < .001). Average 
     power for ankle plantarflexion did not differ significantly from the 
     operative side to the nonoperative side in the slower test (26.46 W 
     vs 27.48 W; P = .60) but did significantly differ on the faster test 
     (32.13 W vs 37.63 W; P = .041). At an average of 19.9 months 
     postoperation, all physical function and pain-related 
     patient-reported outcome scores showed clinically and statistically 
     significant improvement. Conclusion: Achilles reconstruction with a 
     hamstring autograft ± FHL transfer allowed patients with severe 
     Achilles pathology to return to good subjective function, with modest 
     deficits in calf strength compared with the uninjured side. Overall 
     knee flexion strength did not appear impaired. These results suggest 
     that hamstring autograft reconstruction is a viable method to treat 
     these complex cases involving a lack of healthy tissue, allowing 
     patients to return to symptom-free physical function and athletic 
     activity.]

     AB: Background: Ankle arthritis differs from arthritis of the hip and 
     knee in that 80% is posttraumatic and thus often occurs in a younger 
     patient population. The literature supporting total ankle 
     arthroplasty (TAA) in younger patients has increased over recent 
     years and has bolstered the argument that in the short term, TAA in 
     younger patients has successful outcomes that are comparable to 
     older, lower-demand patients. The purpose of our study was to 
     evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and implant survivorship at 
     midterm after primary TAA in patients ≤ 50 years of age at the time 
     of surgery. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of 
     patients ≤ 50 years of age who underwent primary TAA at a single 
     institution from 2000 to 2017. Patient demographics, outcome 
     measures, and complications were recorded. All patients had a minimum 
     clinical follow-up of 5 years. PRO measures were evaluated at 
     preoperative, 1-year postoperative, and final follow-up visits. 
     Paired t tests were performed to compare individual patient changes 
     in PROs from preoperative. Implant survivorship was evaluated based 
     on need for revision of either the tibial or talar component. The 
     need for additional surgery related to the TAA was also evaluated. 
     Results: A total of 58 patients were included. The average age at the 
     time of the index surgery was 43.3 years (range 22-50 years). All 
     patients had a minimum follow-up of 5 years with a mean follow-up of 
     8.8 years. A total of 11 patients required additional surgery related 
     to their TAA. Six patients (10.3%) required bone grafting of 
     peri-implant cysts, 3 patients (5.2 %) required gutter debridement, 
     and 1 patient underwent complete revision of metal components. Mean 
     visual analog scale, 36-item Short Form Health Survey, Short 
     Musculoskeletal Function Assessment, and American Orthopaedic Foot & 
     Ankle Society hindfoot scores significantly improved from 
     preoperative to 1-year postoperative and final postoperative 
     follow-up. Conclusion: The patients aged ≤50 years treated with a 
     TAA whom we have been able to observe for a minimum of 5 years showed 
     generally maintained improvement in functional scores and thus far 
     have had a relatively low rate of secondary surgeries.]

     AB: Background: Vascularized fibula grafts (VFGs) have become one of 
     the most preferred grafts for the reconstruction of bone defects. 
     However, despite the many advantages over other graft options, 
     recipient and donor site morbidities are also common. Donor site 
     morbidity has been reported at rates ranging from 5% to 67%. The aim 
     of this study was to present a single-center series examining the 
     clinical, functional, and radiologic aspects of donor site morbidity 
     following VFG harvesting. Methods: The study included 69 patients who 
     underwent biological reconstruction with VFG for bone tumors, 
     avascular necrosis of the femoral head, or bone defects after trauma. 
     Patients were evaluated functionally, clinically, and radiologically 
     for donor site morbidity. Results: Donor site morbidity was observed 
     in 33 of 69 patients (48%). The most complications were sensation 
     deficits around the feet and ankles (20 of 69; 29%). Knee laxity was 
     more common in patients who underwent osteoarticular fibular 
     resection (P = .006). Conclusion: We found VFG to be an effective 
     method for the reconstruction of large bone defects, but associated 
     with a relatively high rate of complications. Complications requiring 
     surgical intervention were rare and the majority of patients did not 
     have long-term functional limitations.]

     AB: Background: In recent years, arthroscopic lateral ankle ligament 
     repair has become increasingly popular. However, reports on the 
     clinical outcomes of arthroscopic ankle stabilization for skeletally 
     immature patients remain scarce. This study investigated the clinical 
     outcomes of arthroscopic lateral ankle ligaments repair in skeletally 
     immature patients compared to skeletally mature patients. Methods: 
     Our retrospective analysis compared skeletally immature patients and 
     skeletally mature adults who underwent arthroscopic repair of the 
     ankle lateral ligaments with a modified lasso-loop stitch using a 
     suture anchor. Skeletal immaturity was defined as patients whose 
     epiphyseal line of the distal fibula remained open on plain 
     radiography. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the 
     Self-Administered Foot Evaluation Questionnaire (SAFE-Q) at 2 years 
     after surgery. The time to postoperative walking, jogging, and return 
     to full sports activities were also evaluated. Results: Sixty-four 
     skeletally immature patients (IM group) and 103 skeletally mature 
     adults (M group) were included. No significant differences were 
     observed during both walking and jogging after surgery between the 
     groups; however, return to full athletic activities was significantly 
     earlier in IM group (P = .05). The mean scores in all SAFE-Q 
     subscales significantly improved in both groups after surgery (P < 
     .001). There were also no statistically significant differences 
     between the groups in the mean postoperative SAFE-Q scores for all 
     subscales. All patients in the IM group returned to playing sports at 
     their preinjury levels postoperatively. Conclusion: We found that 
     skeletally immature patients with chronic lateral ankle instability 
     had generally similar responses to arthroscopic lateral ankle as 
     skeletally mature adult patients at minimally 2 years' follow-up with 
     a high rate of successful return to sport.]

     were similar between the 2 groups (P > .05). In the cyst group the 
     average cysts depth was 5.0 ± 1.3 mm. After a mean follow-up 
     duration of 36.2 ± 10.2 months, no significant differences were 
     found between the 2 groups in NRS, AOFAS, FAAM, or Tegner score 
     improvement (P > .05). Three patients (19%) in the cyst group had no 
     NRS score improvement. Conclusion: OLTs with small and shallow 
     subchondral cysts can be treated with arthroscopic microfracture and 
     achieve similar outcomes as noncystic lesions. A few cystic lesions 
     may not respond to microfracture treatment.]

     AB: Background: Talar displacement is considered the main predictive 
     factor for poor outcomes and the development of post-traumatic 
     osteoarthritis after ankle fractures. Isolated lateral talar 
     translation, as previously studied by Ramsey and Hamilton using 
     carbon powder imprinting, does not fully replicate the 
     multidirectional joint subluxations seen in ankle fractures. The 
     purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of multiple 
     uniplanar talar displacements on tibiotalar contact mechanics 
     utilizing weightbearing computed tomography (WBCT) and finite element 
     analysis (FEA). Methods: Nineteen subjects (mean age = 37.6 years) 
     with no history of ankle surgery or injury having undergone WBCT 
     arthrogram (n = 1) and WBCT without arthrogram (n = 18) were 
     included. Segmentation of the WBCT images into 3D simulated models of 
     bone and cartilage was performed. Three-dimensional (3D) multiple 
     uniplanar talar displacements were simulated to investigate the 
     respective influence of various uniaxial displacements (including 
     lateral translation, anteroposterior translation, varus-valgus 
     angulation, and external rotation) on the tibiotalar contact 
     mechanics using FEA. Tibiotalar peak contact stress and contact area 
     were modeled for each displacement and its gradations. Results: Our 
     modeling demonstrated that peak contact stress of the talus and tibia 
     increased, whereas contact area decreased, with incremental 
     displacement in all tested directions. Contact stress maps of the 
     talus and tibia were computed for each displacement demonstrating 
     unique patterns of pressure derangement. One millimeter of lateral 
     translation resulted in 14% increase of peak talar contact pressure 
     and a 3% decrease in contact area. Conclusion: Our model predicted 
     that with lateral talar translation, there is less noticeable change 
     in tibiotalar contact area compared with prior studies whereas 
     external rotation greater than 12 degrees had the largest effect on 
     peak contact stress predictions.]

     AB: Background: Metatarsalgia is a common diagnosis for patients with 
     forefoot pain. Many have proposed metatarsal fat pad atrophy is a 
     cause of metatarsalgia and therefore have suggested fat grafting 
     instead of distal metatarsal osteotomies to treat metatarsalgia. For 
     fat grafting to be a viable treatment, fat pad atrophy should 
     correlate with metatarsalgia. This study looked to determine the 
     relationship between metatarsal fat pad thickness and metatarsalgia 
     and the correlation between metatarsal fat pad thickness and 
     patient-reported outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective 
     review of patients with metatarsalgia and those with foot or ankle 
     osteoarthritis who had a nonweightbearing MRI performed between 
     February 1, 2021, and March 1, 2023. Data collected included 
     demographics, PROMIS scores, metatarsal fat pad thickness in the 
     second and third rays of the affected foot, and thinnest area on 
     coronal section, measured on MRI. Student t test was used to compare 
     continuous variables, whereas the χ2 test was used to compare 
     categorical variables. Multivariable linear regression models were 
     used to control for potential confounding factors. Results: A total 
     of 112 patients were included in this study. Patients with 
     metatarsalgia were significantly more likely to have a lower body 
     mass index (29.3 vs 32.0, P = .03) than patients with osteoarthritis, 
     but this finding was not present when controlling for confounding 
     variables. We found no significant difference in fat pad thickness 
     between patients with metatarsalgia vs patients with foot or ankle 
     osteoarthritis (P = .43). We found no correlation between metatarsal 
     fat pad thickness and pain interference (P = .59), physical function 
     (P = .64), or mobility (P = .94) PROMIS scores. Conclusion: In this 
     retrospective comparative study of a relatively small cohort we found 
     no significant difference in metatarsal fat pad thickness for 
     patients with metatarsalgia vs patients with foot and ankle 
     osteoarthritis based on nonweightbearing MRI, and no association 
     between metatarsal fat pad thickness and patient-reported outcomes.]

     integrity of the talonavicular joint. Pathologies affecting this 
     joint often necessitate fusion. Our study explores the risks posed to 
     neurovascular and tendon structures during simulated percutaneous 
     talonavicular joint preparation for fusion. Methods: In 9 fresh 
     cadaver specimens, the talonavicular joint was accessed through two 
     portals. A 2-mm Shannon burr was employed for joint surface 
     preparation with distraction provided by a pin-based distractor. 
     Dissections were performed to assess potential damage to critical 
     structures, including the dorsalis pedis artery, superficial and deep 
     peroneal nerves, extensor hallucis longus (EHL), and tibialis 
     anterior (TA) tendons. Results: The dorsal portal site was found to 
     be significantly closer to important structures compared to the 
     medial portal site. The Shannon burr made contact with various 
     structures, with a single transection identified for both deep and 
     superficial peroneal nerve branches. During the dorsal portal site 
     approach, potential injury to the EHL tendon was identified as 
     concern. Conclusion: This study sheds light on the potential risks 
     associated with percutaneous dorsal and medial joint preparation 
     approaches using a Shannon burr.]

     AB: SARS-CoV-2 Omicron led to the most serious outbreak of COVID-19 
     in Hong Kong in 2022. Under the pressure of a high volume of patients 
     and limited medical resources, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been 
     extensively used. This is a case-control study of the infected 
     patients that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of CHM using data 
     extracted from the Hong Kong Baptist University Telemedicine Chinese 
     Medicine Centre database. Patients with COVID-19 confirmed by either 
     a rapid antigen test or a polymerase chain reaction who had completed 
     two consultations and taken CHM within 10 days of the first positive 
     test were included in the study (CHM group). The matched control 
     cases were those who did not take CHM within 10 days of the first 
     positive test and were based on age (± 3 years), vaccine doses 
     (< 3 doses, or 3 doses), and gender (no-CHM group). The outcomes 
     included the negative conversion time (NCT, primary outcome), 
     total score of individual symptoms, number of the reported symptoms, 
     and individual symptom disappearance rates. The NCT of the CHM 
     group (median days: 7.0, interquartile range: 6.0-8.0) was 
     significantly shorter than that of the no-CHM group (8.0, 
     7.0-10.5). CHM treatment significantly reduced the total score 
     of individual symptoms and the number of the reported symptoms 
     as compared with that of the no-CHM group. Additionally, the 
     symptom disappearance rates of symptoms such as chills, cough, 
     sputum, dry throat, itching throat, headache, chest tightness, 
     abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue were significantly higher 
     in the CHM group than in the no-CHM group. In conclusion, 
     CHM intervention can significantly reduce NCT and COVID-19 
     symptoms. Chinese medicine can be accurately prescribed based 
     on a telemedical consultation.]

     AB: The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in the 
     development of tumors. Immunoregulatory cells and cytokines 
     facilitate cancer cells to avoid immune surveillance. Overexpression 
     of immune checkpoint molecules such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibits 
     immune function and enables cancer cells to avoid clearance by the 
     immune system. Thus, minimizing tumor immunosuppression could be an 
     important strategy for cancer therapy. Currently, many immune 
     checkpoint-targeted drugs, such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, have been 
     approved for marketing and have shown unique advantages in the 
     clinical treatment of cancers. The concept of "strengthening 
     resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors" in traditional Chinese 
     medicine (TCM) is consistent with the immunotherapy of cancer. 
     According to previous studies, the role of TCM in tumor immunotherapy 
     is mainly associated with the positive regulation of natural killer 
     cells, CD8/CD4 T cells, dendritic cells, M2 macrophages, 
     interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IFN-γ, as well as with 
     the negative regulation of Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, 
     cancer-associated fibroblasts, PD-1/PD-L1, transforming growth 
     factor-β, and tumor necrosis factor-β. This paper summarizes the 
     current research on the effect of TCM targeting the TME, and further 
     introduces the research progress on studying the effects of TCM on 
     immune checkpoints. Modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated 
     that TCM can directly or indirectly affect the TME by inhibiting the 
     overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules and enhancing the 
     efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. TCM with immunomodulatory 
     stimulation could be the key factor to achieve benefits from 
     immunotherapy for patients with non-inflammatory, or "cold", tumors.]

     AB: Pyroptosis, an apoptotic pathway for pro-inflammatory cells, has 
     attracted attention from researchers because of its role in the 
     development of cardiac inflammation reactions. Chinese medicine (CM) 
     has been given more and more attention during the pursuit of a 
     treatment for coronary heart disease (CHD). Evidence suggests that 
     myocardial cell pyroptosis affects the progression of CHD. Pyroptosis 
     pathways include the canonical pyroptosis pathway mediated by the 
     caspase-1 inflammasome and the non-canonical pyroptosis pathway 
     induced by cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide-activated caspase-4/5/11. 
     The frequently studied compounds that regulate pyroptosis in CHD 
     include astragaloside IV (AS-IV), tanshinone IIA, aucubin, 
     cinnamaldehyde (CD), ginsenoside Rb1, paeoniflorin, apigenin, 
     berberine (BBR), ruscogenin (Rus), and total glucosides of paeonia 
     (TGP). The patent drugs of CM that regulate pyroptosis in CHD include 
     the Qishen granule (QSG), the Simiao Yong'an decoction (SMYAD), the 
     Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD), and the Shexiang Baoxin pill (SBP). 
     Therefore, this paper reviews the pathogenesis of pyroptosis, the 
     role of pyroptosis in CHD, and the potential therapeutic roles of CMs 
     and their active ingredients targeting cell pyroptosis in the 
     development of CHD.]

     AB: Emodin is a natural compound found in several traditional Chinese 
     medicines, including Rheum palmatum and Polygonum cuspidatum. Recent 
     studies have shown that emodin exhibits potent anticancer effects 
     against a variety of cancer types, including liver, breast, lung, and 
     colon cancer. Emodin's anticancer effects are mediated through 
     several mechanisms, including inhibition of cell proliferation, 
     induction of apoptosis, and suppression of tumor angiogenesis and 
     metastasis. In this review, we provide an overview of recent research 
     progress and new perspectives on emodin's anticancer effect. We 
     summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms 
     underlying emodin's anticancer activity, including its effects on 
     signaling pathways such as the PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB pathways. 
     We also discuss the potential of emodin as a therapeutic agent for 
     cancer treatment, including its use in combination with conventional 
     chemotherapeutic drugs and as a sensitizer for radiotherapy. 
     Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in the development of 
     emodin derivatives and their potential as novel anticancer agents. 
     Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for the 
     translation of emodin's anticancer properties into clinical 
     applications, including the need for further preclinical and clinical 
     studies to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In conclusion, emodin 
     represents a promising natural compound with potent anticancer 
     properties, and its potential as a therapeutic agent for cancer 
     treatment warrants further investigation. This review provides a 
     comprehensive overview of the current research progress and new 
     perspectives on emodin's anticancer effects, which may facilitate the 
     development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.]

     AB: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prescriptions are organically 
     composed of compatible herbs according to the TCM theory. The complex 
     ingredients of TCM could act on multiple targets through various 
     pathways simultaneously to exert pharmacological effects, making TCM 
     an unrivaled gem in the medical world. However, due to a lack of 
     comprehensive and standard study methods, the research of TCM 
     products has been quite limited. A novel paradigm that could aid in 
     the discovery of the material basis and fully clarify the mechanism 
     of TCM prescriptions is urgently needed. In this study, a similarity 
     analysis based on molecular fingerprints was adopted to explore the 
     representative molecules of the Tiaoxin recipe, a Chinese patent 
     formula approved by the National Medical Products Administration 
     (NMPA) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease 
     (AD), and 38 out of 1047 chemicals were finally screened out. Next, 
     we tried to define a new concept of a "functional molecule cluster" 
     for chemicals with similar pharmacological effects to elucidate how 
     the chemical mixture from TCMs produce their therapeutic effects. 
     Four anti-AD functional molecule clusters from the Tiaoxin recipe 
     were identified: an anti-inflammatory cluster, an anti-ROS cluster, 
     an anti-AChE activity cluster, and an anti-Aβ aggregation cluster. 
     Furthermore, the chemicals from the anti-inflammatory cluster and 
     anti-ROS cluster were proved to display their multi-target and 
     multi-pathway roles partially or mainly through molecules of the 
     TLR4-MYD88-NF-κB and Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathways. The functional 
     molecule clusters may be vital to the explanation of the efficacy of 
     the Tiaoxin recipe, which could give us a more profound understanding 
     of TCM prescriptions. Our paradigm may open a novel path for TCM 
     research.]

     AB: Sleep deprivation (SD) has become a universal social problem. 
     There is a causal relationship between SD and energy metabolism 
     disorder. Phytochemicals have been demonstrated to have excellent 
     sleep-promoting effects, and studies have shown that ginsenoside Rg5 
     (Rg5) exerts sedative and hypnotic effects. The present study aimed 
     to investigate the role of Rg5 in regulating energy metabolism and 
     explore the potential mechanism of improving sleep. Sleep-deprived 
     rats were randomly divided into a control group (Ctrl), SD model 
     group (SD), Rg5 group (GRg5), and melatonin group (MT). 
     Sleep-deprived model rats were generated by housing rats in an SD box 
     for 4 weeks. The Ctrl and SD groups were given equal volumes of 
     saline. The Rg5 groups were given 25mg/kg Rg5 or 50mg/kg Rg5, and the 
     MT group was given 0.27g/kg MT. A Western blot analysis and ELISA 
     were used to detect the metabolic levels, mitochondrial functional 
     proteins, AMPK pathway proteins, clock-related proteins, adenosine 
     receptors, and neurotransmitter receptors. The results showed that 
     Rg5 corrected abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism as well as 
     improved ATP levels. In addition, Rg5 alleviated mitochondrial 
     structural damage and improved the expression of proteins involved in 
     mitochondrial biosynthesis, fission, and fusion. Moreover, Rg5 
     improved the expression of AMPK/PGC-1/Nrf-1 pathway proteins, 
     regulated mitochondrial biological functions, and affected the rhythm 
     characteristics of circadian clock-related proteins. Further, Rg5 
     improved the expression of A1R and A2AR as well as regulated the 
     expression levels of GABAA1α and mGluR5 to improve sleep in SD 
     rats.]

     AB: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy accompanies numerous cardiovascular 
     diseases, and the intervention of cardiac hypertrophy is an important 
     issue to prevent detrimental consequences. Mangiferin (MGN) is a 
     glucosylxanthone found in Mangifera indica, which exhibits 
     anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Various studies have 
     demonstrated the cardioprotective potential of MGN, but the 
     mechanisms behind its beneficial effects have not been fully 
     revealed. Here, angiotensin-II (Ang-II) was used to induce cardiac 
     hypertrophy, and we examined cell size, expression of hypertrophy 
     markers (e.g. ANP, BNP, and β-MHC), and oxidative stress (e.g. the 
     ratio of NADPH/NADP+, the expression of p22phox and p67phox, and ROS 
     and SOD production) of cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we assessed the 
     activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (e.g. 
     p38 and ERK) and the NF-κBp65/iNOS axis. Additionally, an annexin 
     V/PI assay was employed to evaluate whether MGN administration can 
     attenuate Ang-II-elicited apoptosis. Lastly, the expression of Ang-II 
     type 1 receptor (AT1) was measured to confirm its involvement in 
     MGN-mediated protection. Our results showed that treatment with MGN 
     attenuated the Ang-II-induced cell size, expression of hypertrophy 
     markers, and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. MGN also abrogated 
     the activation of MAPK signaling and the NF-κBp65/iNOS axis. 
     Additionally, MGN prevented apoptosis and downregulated the elevation 
     of AT1 in cardiomyocytes that had been exposed to Ang-II. Altogether, 
     these results demonstrated the potential of using MGN to ameliorate 
     the Ang-II-associated cardiac hypertrophy, which may be due to its 
     anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects through suppression of 
     MAPK signaling and the NF-κBp65/iNOS axis.]

     AB: Ruscogenin (RUS), a major effective steroidal sapogenin derived 
     from Ophiopogon japonicas, has been reported to alleviate myocardial 
     ischemia (MI), but its cardioprotective mechanism is still not 
     completely clear. In this study, we observed that RUS markedly 
     reduced MI-induced myocardial injury, as evidenced by notable 
     reductions in infarct size, improvement in biochemical markers, 
     alleviation of cardiac pathology, amelioration of mitochondrial 
     damage, and inhibition of myocardial apoptosis. Moreover, RUS notably 
     suppressed oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-triggered cell injury and 
     apoptosis. Notably, RUS demonstrated a considerable decrease of the 
     interaction between myosin IIA and F-actin, along with the 
     restoration of mitochondrial fusion and fission balance. We further 
     confirmed that the effects of RUS on MI were mediated by myosin IIA 
     using siRNA and overexpression techniques. The inhibition of myosin 
     IIA resulted in a significant improvement of mitochondrial fusion and 
     fission imbalance, while simultaneously counteracting the beneficial 
     effects of RUS. By contrast, overexpression of myosin IIA aggravated 
     the imbalance between mitochondrial fusion and fission and partially 
     weakened the protection of RUS. These findings suggest that myosin 
     IIA is essential or even a key functional protein in the 
     cardioprotection of RUS. Overall, our results have elucidated an 
     undiscovered mechanism involving myosin IIA-dependent mitochondrial 
     fusion and fission balance for treating MI. Furthermore, our study 
     has uncovered a novel mechanism underlying the protective effects of 
     RUS.]

     AB: Hexokinase 2 (HK2), the first glycolytic rate-limiting enzyme, is 
     closely correlated with the occurrence and progression of tumors. 
     Effective therapeutic agents targeting HK2 are urgently needed. 
     Bergenin has exhibited various pharmacological activities, such as 
     antitumor properties. However, the effects of bergenin on the 
     abnormal glucose metabolism of cancer cells are yet unclear. In this 
     study, HK2 was overexpressed in OSCC tissues, and the depletion of 
     HK2 inhibited the growth of OSCC cells in vitro and in vivo. 
     Moreover, these results showed that the natural compound, bergenin, 
     exerted a robust antitumor effect on OSCC cells. Bergenin inhibited 
     cancer cell proliferation, suppressed glycolysis, and induced 
     intrinsic apoptosis in OSCC cells by downregulating HK2. Notably, 
     bergenin restored the antitumor efficacy of irradiation in the 
     radioresistant OSCC cells. A mechanistic study revealed that bergenin 
     upregulated the protein level of phosphatase and the tensin homolog 
     deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) by enhancing the interaction between 
     PTEN and ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) and stabilizing PTEN; 
     this eventually inhibited AKT phosphorylation and HK2 expression. 
     Bergenin was identified as a novel therapeutic agent against 
     glycolysis to inhibit OSCC and overcome radioresistance. Targeting 
     PTEN/AKT/HK2 signaling could be a promising option for clinical OSCC 
     treatment.]

     AB: Context: In March 2020, public health concerns resulted in school 
     closure throughout the United States. The prolonged sport cessation 
     may affect knee injury risk in high school athletes. The purpose of 
     this study was to describe and compare risk of knee injuries in high 
     school athletes during 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 academic years, and 
     stratify by gender, severity, mechanism of injury, injury type, and 
     knee anatomic region. Design: Historical-prospective cohort study. 
     Methods: This historical-prospective cohort study included 176 
     schools in 6 states matched by sport participation in control and 
     COVID years from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021. Injury rates per 1000 
     athletes per year were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. A 
     negative binomial regression was performed to assess potential 
     differences in knee injuries between academic years. Results: 94,847 
     and 72,521 high school athletes participated in the 2019-2020 (19-20) 
     and 2020-2021 (20-21) seasons. Knee injury risk was higher in the 
     20-21 season (19-20: 28.89% [27.82-29.96]; 20-21: 33.82% 
     [32.50-35.14]). Risk increased for male athletes from 2019-2020 to 
     2020-2021 (19-20: 29.42% [28.01-30.83]; 20-21: 40.32% [38.89-41.75]). 
     Female knee injury risk was similar between years (19-20: 25.78% 
     [24.29-27.27]; 20-21: 26.03% [24.31-27.75]). Knee injuries increased 
     by a ratio of 1.2 ([95% CI, 1.1-1.3], P < .001) during 2020-2021. 
     Conclusions: Knee injury risk and relative risk increased among males 
     in 2020-2021. Results indicate changes in knee injury risk following 
     return from COVID shelter in place among high school athletes and 
     implicate potential negative downstream effects of interrupted sports 
     training and participation on high school injury risk.]

     AB: Context: Psychological difficulties can adversely affect 
     rehabilitation outcomes and make return to sport more difficult. 
     Identifying psychological difficulties is possible with valid and 
     reliable measurement tools. The purpose of this study is to translate 
     and culturally adapt the Reinjury Anxiety Inventory (RIAI), the Sport 
     Injury Rehabilitation Adherence Scale (SIRAS), and the Athletic 
     Injury Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (AISEQ) into Turkish and evaluate 
     the psychometric properties of the Turkish versions. Design: 
     Cross-sectional study. Methods: The instruments were forward- and 
     back-translated, culturally adapted, and validated on 248 athletes 
     and 34 physical therapists. The physical therapists of the athletes 
     completed the SIRAS to evaluate the athletes. Statistical analysis 
     included reliability tests (Cronbach alpha and test-retest), 
     exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and 
     correlational analysis. Floor and ceiling effects (<15%) were also 
     assessed. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed a 
     satisfactory model fit for the RIAI and the AISEQ, and exploratory 
     factor analysis revealed the 1-factor structure for the SIRAS as in 
     the original. All 3 instruments displayed adequate internal 
     consistency (Cronbach alpha coefficients ranged from .84 to .88) and 
     test-retest reliability (coefficients ranged from .81 to .93). 
     Convergent validity of the instruments was supported by significant 
     correlations between the AISEQ and both the RIAI and the SIRAS. 
     Conclusions: Our results suggest that the Turkish versions of the 
     instruments were valid, consistent, and reliable in athletes who have 
     serious injuries. Scores on these instruments could be useful for 
     evaluating the contributions of psychological factors to return to 
     sport following serious injuries. Clinicians are encouraged to use 
     RIAI-Turkish (RIAI-TR), SIRAS-Turkish (SIRAS-TR), and AISEQ-Turkish 
     (AISEQ-TR) together to make decisions about the treatment and 
     rehabilitation plans of injured athletes.]

     only observational study design. All players were only evaluated once 
     during the in-season to generate normative ranges. Methods: A total 
     of 51 female players volunteered. Participants were evaluated on an 
     isokinetic dynamometer at 60° per second to obtain knee-extensor and 
     knee-flexor values as well as shoulder-flexor and shoulder-extensor 
     values. A total of 16 anthropometric variables were collected 
     including stature, body mass, 8 skinfolds, and 6 circumferences. 
     Between-group differences were calculated to determine whether 
     playing level was a differentiating factor in data. Results: 
     Normative standards were developed for isokinetic parameters 
     associated with the knee and shoulder joints as well as skinfolds and 
     circumference measures. No statistically significant between-group 
     differences were evident (χ2Kruskal-Wallis[2] = 3.96, P = .140). 
     Conclusion: These standards can be used by coaches and practitioners 
     to set attainable goals for individual players or those from 
     secondary leagues, classify individual and team-based performances, 
     and facilitate decision-making processes.]

     Thirty-two anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed patients for whom 
     6 months had passed since their operation were randomly assigned to 
     either the KT (n = 16, aged 21.8 [5.5] y) or the placebo KT (n = 16, 
     aged 24.0 [5.1] y) groups. Initially, both groups stood barefoot on a 
     force platform while performing postural tasks in 4 randomized 
     conditions (eyes open, eyes closed, cognitive task, and foam). Before 
     the experiment, patients would bring the 4 conditions, which were 
     written on folded papers, one by one, and in this way, the order of 
     conditions for the examiners was determined. The patients' 
     evaluations were conducted immediately and 48 hours after KT 
     application. Postural control measures, with area and displacement of 
     the center of pressure (CoP) in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral 
     directions, and mean total velocity displacement of CoP (MVELO CoP) 
     served as dependent variables. In addition, the International Knee 
     Documentation Committee score was measured pretreatment and 48 hours 
     posttreatment. Results: Significant group-by-time interactions were 
     observed for displacement of COP in medial-lateral direction (P = 
     .002) and MVELO CoP (P = .034). MVELO CoP significantly decreased 
     (mean difference = 0.60, P = .009) immediately after KT application 
     compared with preapplication measures. In the placebo group, a 
     statistically significant decrease in MVELO CoP (mean difference = 
     0.869, P = .001) was observed at 48 hours post-KT compared with 
     preapplication values. International Knee Documentation Committee 
     scores significantly improved at 48 hours post-KT application in both 
     groups (P < .05). Conclusions: Though observed at different time 
     points, both KT (immediately after the intervention) and placebo KT 
     (48 h after the intervention) were found to improve postural control 
     measures. It appears that the changes in postural control may be more 
     related to proprioceptive enhancement due to KT rather than the 
     specific KT pattern.]

     AB: Background: Local high-frequency percussive (HFP) massage has 
     recently found widespread application in physical therapy. Although 
     HFP massage reportedly improves range of motion (ROM), the mechanism 
     underlying its action has not yet been proven. This study aimed to 
     clarify whether a 5-minute percussive massage regimen affects 
     muscular or connective tissues, such as the deep fascia and deep 
     intermuscular fascia and the change in joint ROM. Method: The study 
     sample was calculated using G*Power analysis program, and this study 
     enrolled 15 healthy men who underwent 5-minute HFP massage to the 
     medial gastrocnemius muscle. Shear-wave elastography was used to 
     measure tissue stiffness in the deep fascia, muscle, and deep 
     intermuscular fascia through shear-wave velocity as well as the ROM 
     of the volunteers' ankle joint dorsiflexion before and after the HFP 
     massage. A value of P < .05 was used to declare statistical 
     significance, and post hoc was used to calculate the effect size 
     using G*Power. Results: Shear-wave velocity revealed a significant 
     change in the deep fascia (P = .003; shear-wave velocity: −0.7 m/s) 
     and significant increase in ROM of ankle dorsiflexion (P = .002; 
     increase in ROM: 3.0°) after 5 minutes of HFP massage. However, the 
     muscle and deep intermuscular fascia did not exhibit any significant 
     changes. Conclusions: HFP massage for 5 minutes modified the 
     stiffness of the deep fascia and concurrently improved the ankle 
     joint-dorsiflexion ROM. This method can be used as an intervention to 
     decrease stiffness of the deep fascia and increase the ROM 
     efficiently.]

     AB: Context: A reduced knee extensor moment (KEM) in the involved 
     limb and asymmetry in the KEM during landing tasks are observed after 
     anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). There is limited 
     information about the association of kinetic and kinematic parameters

     association of the anterior-posterior center of pressure (AP-COP) 
     position, vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), and lower limb joint 
     angles with the KEM during landing in female athletes following ACLR. 
     Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Twenty-two female athletes

     smaller than that in the uninvolved limb (11.9 [2.3] N/kg vs 14.6 
     [3.5] N/kg, P = .005). The limb symmetry index of the KEM was 
     predicted by that of the VGRF (P < .001, R2 = .621, β = 0.800). The 
     KEM was predicted by the AP-COP position in the involved limb (P = 
     .015, R2 = .227, β = 0.513) and by the VGRF in the uninvolved limb 
     (P = .018, R2 = .213, β = 0.500). No significant correlation was 
     noted between the KEM and the lower limb joint angles. Conclusions: 
     The AP-COP position and VGRF were associated with the KEM during 
     landing. Evaluating the VGRF and AP-COP position, not the lower limb 
     joint angles, may contribute to understanding the KEM during 
     double-leg landing after ACLR in the clinical setting.]

     AB: Context: The hamstrings are the most commonly injured muscle in 
     sports and are especially injury prone in lengthened positions. 
     Measuring knee muscle strength in such positions could be relevant to 
     establish injury risk. Handheld dynamometry has been shown to be a 
     valid, reliable, and practical tool to measure isometric muscle 
     strength clinically. The aim of this study was to assess the validity 
     and reliability of the assessment of isometric knee muscle strength 
     with a handheld dynamometer (HHD) at various muscle lengths, by 
     modifying the hip and knee angles during testing. Design: Concurrent 
     validity and test-retest reliability. Methods: Thirty young healthy 
     participants were recruited. Hamstring and quadriceps isometric 
     strength was measured with a HHD and with an isokinetic dynamometer, 
     over 2 testing sessions, in a randomized order. Isometric strength 
     was measured on the right lower limb in 6 different positions, with 
     the hip at either 0° or 80° of flexion and the knee at either 30°, 
     60°, or 90° of flexion. Pearson and Spearman correlations were used 
     to assess the validity, and intraclass correlation coefficients were 
     calculated to establish the test-retest reliability of the HHD. 
     Results: Good to excellent reliability and moderate to high validity 
     were found in all the tested muscle length positions, except for the 
     hamstrings in a seated position with the knee extended at 30°. 
     Conclusions: The use of a HHD is supported in the clinical setting to 
     measure knee muscle strength at varying muscle lengths in healthy 
     adults, but not for the hamstrings in a lengthened position (hip 
     flexed and knee extended). These results will have to be confirmed in 
     sport-specific populations.]

     AB: Context: Injury-related fear and quadriceps strength are 
     independently associated with secondary anterior cruciate ligament 
     (ACL) injury risk. It is not known whether injury-related fear and 
     quadriceps strength are associated, despite their individual 
     predictive capabilities of secondary ACL injury. The purpose of this 
     study was to examine the association between injury-related fear and 
     quadriceps strength in individuals at least 1 year after ACL 
     reconstruction (ACLR). Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Forty 
     participants between the ages of 18 and 35 years at least 1 year post 
     unilateral primary ACLR. Participants completed the Tampa Scale of 
     Kinesiophobia-11 (TSK-11) and a standard isokinetic quadriceps 
     strength assessment using the Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer. Pearson 
     Product-Moment correlations were used to examine the linear 
     association between the TSK-11 scores and peak torque (in nanometers 
     per kilogram) for each limb and between the TSK-11 scores and limb 
     symmetry indices for each limb. Pearson Product-Moment correlation 
     coefficients (r) were interpreted as very high (.90-1.00), high 
     (.70-.90), moderate (.50-.70), low (.30-.50), and no correlation 
     (.00-.30). Results: The average TSK-11 score was 18.2 (5.3), average 
     ACLR peak quadriceps torque was 1.9 (0.50) N·m/kg, average 
     contralateral peak quadriceps torque was 2.3 (0.48) N·m/kg, and 
     average limb symmetry index was 85.3% (12.6%). There was no 
     statistically significant correlation between the TSK-11 and peak 
     quadriceps torque on the ACLR limb (r = .12, P = .46), the TSK-11 and 
     contralateral limb (r = .29, P = .07), or the TSK-11 and limb 
     symmetry index (r = -.18, P = .27). Conclusions: There was no 
     association between kinesiophobia and peak isokinetic quadriceps 
     strength in individuals at least 1 year post-ACLR. Both factors, 
     independently, have been shown to influence risk of secondary injury 
     in patients after ACLR.]

     AB: Context: Piriformis syndrome is often associated with muscle 
     spasms and shortening of the piriformis muscle (PM). Physical 
     therapy, including static stretching of the PM, is one of the 
     treatments for this syndrome. However, the effective stretching 
     position of the PM is unclear in vivo. This study aimed to determine 
     the effective stretching positions of the PM using ultrasonic shear 
     wave elastography. Design: Observational study. Methods: Twenty-one 
     healthy young men (22.7 [2.4] y) participated in this study. The 
     shear elastic modulus of the PM was measured at 12 stretching 
     positions using shear wave elastography. Three of the 12 positions 
     were tested with maximum internal rotation at 0°, 20°, or 40° hip 
     adduction in 90° hip flexion. Nine of the 12 positions were tested 
     with maximum external rotation at positions combined with 3 
     hip-flexion angles (70°, 90°, and 110°) and 3 hip-adduction angles 
     (0°, 20°, and 40°). Results: The shear elastic modulus of the PM 
     was significantly higher in the order of 40°, 20°, and 0° of 
     adduction and higher in external rotation than in internal rotation. 
     The shear elastic modulus of the PM was significantly greater in 
     combined 110° hip flexion and 40° adduction with maximum external 
     rotation than in all other positions. Conclusion: This study revealed 
     that the position in which the PM was most stretched was maximum 
     external rotation with 110° hip flexion and 40° hip adduction.]

     AB: Context: Rehabilitation after an anterior cruciate ligament 
     injury is recommended to be started soon after the injury. When 
     surgery is required, research supports the delivery of physiotherapy 
     before anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (prehabilitation) to 
     optimize recovery and positive outcomes. Individuals attending 
     prehabilitation have never been questioned regarding their adherence 
     to prehabilitation, perception of utility in meeting needs, upcoming 
     events, or anticipated recovery goals. Design: Mixed methods 
     cross-sectional study: Methods: 25 individuals before anterior 
     cruciate ligament reconstruction (43% of eligible individuals from 12 
     clinics during the delivery period) were surveyed on their mindset 
     and recovery expectancies. Semistructured interviews conducted in 9 
     of 25 participants assessed their lived experience of 
     prehabilitation. Results: Participants reported that preventing a 
     reinjury (96% of responses) and feeling confident during daily 
     activities about their knee (92%) were the higher rating expectations 
     at this stage of their treatment course. Three themes were developed 
     from the interviews and analyses. (1) Participants reported that 
     prehabilitation was a period full of challenges with memories of the 
     injury and uncertainties. (2) They viewed prehabilitation as a step 
     to move forward by finding support and self-motivating. (3) They 
     believed that prehabilitation would have positive impacts on the 
     treatment outcomes. Participants were confident that prehabilitation 
     would accelerate the recovery of muscle volume (88%) and strength 
     (84%). Conclusion: Participants had positive experiences of 
     prehabilitation, aligning with the findings on functional outcomes in 
     the existing literature on prehabilitation.]

     AB: Context: Osteitis pubis (OP), which occurs as a result of 
     excessive use of the symphysis pubis and parasymphysis bones, is more 
     common in long-distance runners and kicking athletes, especially 
     football players. Due to the poor results of commonly used treatments 
     for OP, there is a need for investigation of more effective 
     treatments, such as ozone therapy. Ozone therapy is used to treat a 
     variety of diseases, including musculoskeletal conditions. Case 
     Presentation: A 30-year-old amateur soccer player diagnosed with OP 
     received conservative treatment with traditional physiotherapy and 
     analgesic medications. After 6 months and no resolution of symptoms, 
     the patient presented to the sports medicine outpatient clinic 
     seeking alternative therapy options. Management and Outcomes: The 
     patient received ozone injections in 3 sessions administered at 
     10-day intervals. At 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment, the 
     patient's complaints and pain levels were re-evaluated and examined. 
     The patient was able to return to competition at the same level after 
     the first injection. No recurrence was revealed at a minimum of 12 
     months of follow-up. Conclusion: In this article, we present a case 
     in which OP was successfully treated with ozone injection.]

     AB: Context: Lateral epicondylopathy (LE) is a common overuse injury 
     affecting elbow, wrist, and hand function. It is characterized by 
     weakness and pain in the muscles and tendons of the forearm 
     responsible for the extension of your wrist and fingers. Trigger 
     point dry needling is a technique reported to be beneficial in 
     managing pain and dysfunction after LE diagnosis. LE is also commonly 
     treated with conservative treatment, such as joint and soft tissue 
     mobilization, self-care home programs, and anti-inflammatory use. We 
     explored a different dry needling approach consisting of in situ dry 
     needling with electric stimulation combined with targeted therapeutic 
     exercise to treat LE in 3 cases. Case Presentation: Three patients 
     were referred for dry needling once a week for 6 weeks and home-based 
     exercise therapy for LE. They were clinically evaluated using grip 
     strength, a visual analog scale to assess pain, and Patient-Rated 
     Tennis Elbow Evaluation Test scores. These were measured at 4 time 
     points (weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6). Management and Outcomes: The dry 
     needling intervention incorporated 8 locations in the upper-extremity 
     with 2 electric stimulation channels. The patients had reduced pain 
     as measured by a visual analog scale, increased function as measured 
     by the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Test, and increased grip 
     strength over 6 weeks. Conclusions: This case series illustrates the 
     use of dry needling and a home exercise program to provide a 
     favorable outcome in a patient with LE. Patients had an 80% to 100% 
     reduction in pain and similar improvements in function that were 
     significantly beyond the minimum clinically important difference. 
     This dry needling approach is a safe and effective treatment of LE in 
     the short term.]

     AB: BACKGROUND: Nordic hamstring exercise is an effective method for 
     preventing hamstring strain injury. In this study, we investigated 
     the response of knee flexors regarding increased muscle force and 
     fatigue when the Nordic hamstring exercise was performed repeatedly 
     to further understand how it can prevent hamstring strain 
     injury.METHODS: The Nordic hamstring exercise was performed 10 times 
     by 53 athletes; knee flexor peak tensile force and the respective 
     flexion angle were compared at different phases during this sequence: 
     phase 1, 1st Nordic hamstring exercise force; phase 2, mean value 
     during the 2-4th repetitions; phase 3, mean value during the 5-7th 
     repetitions; and phase 4, mean value during the 8-10th repetitions. 
     We also divided the knee flexor peak force into deep and slight 
     flexion zones and evaluated changes during different phases.RESULTS: 
     Knee flexor peak force was most significant in phase 2 and decreased 
     during subsequent phases. The knee angle at which peak force was 
     exerted was greatest in phase 1 and decreased thereafter. When we 
     compared the knee flexor peak force in different flexion angle zones, 
     increased muscle force in the slight flexion zone was greater than 
     increased muscle force in the deep flexion zone in phases 2 and 
     3.CONCLUSIONS: Enhancement of the knee flexor force, especially in 
     the slight flexion zone occurs after only a few repetitions of the 
     Nordic hamstring exercise.]

     AB: BACKGROUND: Speed skating is a discipline that involves cyclical 
     and repetitive movements that make athletes susceptible to injuries, 
     especially in the groin. In professional athletes, during a season, 
     it was found that about 20% had overuse injuries with significant 
     consequences during the competitive season due to long recovery 
     times. Currently, new technological tools allow the measurement of 
     multiple parameters and, through a panel of data deriving from 
     various measurements, provide a valuable aid for training and 
     rehabilitative purposes. This study aimed to probe the potential of 
     the new analysis algorithm, or its ability to detect differences 
     inelectromyographic and acceleration patterns between newcomers to 
     the discipline and professional athletes.METHODS: We proceeded 
     through measurements using a system based on an inertial sensor and 
     four probes for surface electromyography.RESULTS: The analysis 
     highlights important differences both from the point of view of 
     accelerations (with marked oscillations on the three axes of the 
     neophyte concerning greater stability of the professional's trunk) 
     and a different pattern of muscle activation during joint movement a 
     greater coactivation of the neophyte compared to the professional, 
     which could lead to a greater risk of injury due to less 
     training.CONCLUSIONS: This new protocol, when validated on a 
     statistically significant sample of elite athletes leading to 
     specific benchmarks, can be used to improve athletes' performances 
     and maybe to prevent athletes' injuries.]

     AB: Objective: To investigate chiropractic students' preferences and 
     perceptions of remote learning with a secondary aim of comparing 
     individuals with and without learning challenges. Methods: Following 
     the mandatory period of remote education, a 33-question, 
     mixed-methods, anonymous online survey was distributed from March to 
     September 2021 to a single-campus chiropractic student body with an 
     estimated sample study population of N = 1375. Demographic variables, 
     self-reported learning challenges, technology skills, and perceptions 
     of remote and on-ground learning delivery modalities were gathered. 
     Percentages, measures of central tendency, and chi-square tests were 
     performed on the data. Results: There were 117 participants (8.5%), 
     of whom 63.2% were female (n = 74) and 87.2% (n = 102) were aged 
     18-34 years. Self-identified learning challenges were present in 
     33.3% (n = 39) of participants, of whom 28 stated they had 
     attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or attention-deficit 
     disorder. More than 85.5% (n = 100) of participants agreed they were 
     proficient with the necessary technology. For basic science classes 
     with a lecture and lab component, 61.5% (n = 72) preferred on-ground 
     labs and remote lectures. Participants agreed that remote lectures 
     and on-ground labs were a good use of time (75.2% [n = 88] and 79.5% 
     [n = 93], respectively). There was a significant χ2 between 
     individuals with and without learning challenges for the perception 
     of "stimulating and interesting" (p = .044) and "attention" (p = 
     .001) for on-ground lectures. Conclusion: Chiropractic students 
     preferred remote and on-ground education differentially for labs and 
     lectures. On-ground labs provided greater perceived educational 
     benefits; perceived benefits of remote lecture courses were only 
     modestly supported. Students with self-identified learning challenges 
     presented with some differences related to perception of on-ground 
     lectures.]

     AB: Objective: The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) 
     is a commonly used assessment of clinical skill. Ensuring the quality 
     and reliability of OSCEs is a complex and ongoing process. This paper 
     discusses scoring schemas and reviews checklists and global rating 
     scales (GRS) for marking. Also detailed are post-examination quality 
     assurance metrics tailored to smaller cohorts, with an illustrative 
     dataset. Methods: A deidentified OSCE dataset, from stations with a 
     checklist and GRS, of 24 examinees from a 2021 cohort was assessed 
     using the following metrics: Cut scores or pass rates, number of 
     failures, R2, intergrade discrimination, and between-group variation. 
     The results were used to inform a set of implementable 
     recommendations to improve future OSCEs. Results: For most stations, 
     the cut score calculated was higher than the traditional pass of 50% 
     (58.9.8%-68.4%). The number of failures was low for traditional pass 
     rates and cut scores (0.00-16.7%), except lab analysis where number 
     of failures was 50.0%. R2 values ranged from 0.67-0.97, but the 
     proportion of total variance was high (67.3-95.9). These data suggest 
     there were potential missed teaching concepts, that station marking 
     was open to examiner interpretation, and there were inconsistencies 
     in examiner marking. Recommendations included increasing examiner 
     training, using GRSs specific to each station, and reviewing all 
     future OSCEs with the metrics described to guide refinements. 
     Conclusion: The analysis used revealed several potential issues with 
     the OSCE assessment. These findings informed recommendations to 
     improve the quality of our future examinations.]

     study to assess validity with the PFI. The MBI and PFI were analyzed 
     via pairwise correlation. Demographic and relevant term questions 
     were asked at baseline and respective terms and analyzed with 
     descriptive statistics. Results: Of the study's 78 respondents (72.2% 
     response rate), 55.8% were male with an average age of 28.6 years. 
     Pairwise comparisons revealed statistically significant burnout 
     differences between the baseline timepoint and the end of the eighth 
     term, and between the baseline and the end of the ninth term. PFI 
     burnout was correlated to emotional exhaustion in the MBI. 
     Conclusion: Our study found that approximately half of the 
     participating chiropractic students suffered from burnout. This 
     percentage is similar to burnout rates seen in other health care 
     providers. Moreover, there is no widely accepted burnout threshold 
     used in the literature. As such, studies examining standardization of 
     burnout calculations may be warranted.]

     AB: Objective: This project compared student learning and 
     satisfaction of an anatomy review delivered by a face-to-face lecture 
     (F2FL) and an online learning module (OLM) for third-year doctor of 
     chiropractic students. Methods: This cohort study compared student 
     learning and satisfaction of a pediatric spinal anatomy review 
     delivered via F2FL (cohort 1, n = 23) and OLM (cohort 2, n = 18) in 2 
     successive 2019 (pre-COVID) course offerings. Previously validated 
     pre- and post-tests were given. Students completed a survey assessing 
     delivery, comfort with online learning and online learning 
     technology, and preference of F2FL vs OLM of review material. Pre- 
     and post-test results were assessed using repeated-measures analysis 
     of variance. Results: Testing results showed an improvement with both 
     groups (F2FL 53.7%, p < .001 vs OLM 51.8%, p < .001), with no 
     significant difference between the F2FL and OLM groups (p = .53; p = 
     .82). The survey showed: 83.3% of OLM students felt the online method 
     was effective, and 88.9% of the OLM students would prefer online 
     reviews or have no preference between online or face-to-face; 
     meanwhile, 80% of the F2FL group thought the lecture 
     engaging/effective, whereas 60% of the F2FL group would have 
     preferred to have the material presented online. Conclusion: The OLM 
     was found to be as effective as the F2FL for the content assessed. 
     The majority of students would prefer the online method for future 
     anatomy review content presented in the course. This strategy could 
     be applied to provide review materials in other clinical courses, 
     allowing material to be developed and given by content experts while 
     freeing valuable in-class time.]

     AB: Objective: In 2008, an interprofessional education (IPE) working 
     group was formed to develop a module on interdisciplinary low-back 
     pain management to fill a curricular gap at our institution. This 
     article describes the program evaluation outcomes and highlights 
     factors contributing to its successful implementation over 8 years 
     through reference to Brigg's Presage-Process-Product (3-P) Model of 
     Teaching and Learning. Methods: Program evaluation occurred through 
     administration of a pre- and postmodule Health Professional 
     Collaborative Competency Perception Scale, with scores compared using 
     paired t tests. Descriptive statistics were analyzed from 5-point 
     Likert scales for module session components. Results: A total of 853 
     students from 9 health care occupations (medicine, chiropractic, 
     physiotherapy, pharmacy, nursing, nurse practitioner, occupational 
     therapy, physiotherapy assistants, and occupational therapist 
     assistants) participated in 51 iterations of the module from 2011 to 
     2019, averaging 16 participants each session. All Health Professional 
     Collaborative Competency Perception Scale items significantly 
     improved from pre- to postintervention (p < .001) for learners from 6 
     health professions. Module components were rated highly, with the 
     majority of learners rating these as 4 (helpful) or 5 (very helpful) 
     for their learning. Participants also improved their scores in 
     perceived history and physical exam comfort, knowledge of 
     pharmacotherapy, management options, and attitudes regarding an 
     interprofessional approach to back pain (p < .001). Conclusion: This 
     article describes the presage, process factors, and products of this 
     model IPE program that provides learners from various health care 
     professions with an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the 
     interdisciplinary management of low-back pain, as demonstrated 
     through improvement in collaborative competencies.]

     AB: Objective: The doctor of chiropractic program (DCP) graduate must 
     demonstrate competency in clinical research literacy (CRL), per 
     accreditation standards. This study aimed to compare student CRL 
     knowledge, confidence, and attitudes between the beginning and end of 
     their DCP. Methods: We collected data on 245 matriculating students' 
     CRL knowledge, confidence, and attitudes between 2017 and 2018. In 
     2021 and 2022, 78 of these students enrolled in a course with an 
     extra credit assignment that was used to re-collect CRL data as they 
     approached graduation. We assessed changes between entry and exit 
     using statistical analyses in STATA17. Results: Paired data were 
     collected for 56 students. The mean CRL scores on a scale of 10 at 
     the DCP beginning and end were 5.25 (SD 2.06) and 6.54 (SD 1.89), 
     respectively (p = .0001). We observed statistically significant (p 
     ≤ .05) positive changes in students' abilities to answer questions 
     about Medical Subject Headings, the hierarchy of evidence, systematic 
     reviews, meta-analyses, and the limitations of abstracts. There was 
     also a statistically significant increase in confidence, with over 
     80% of students nearing graduation reporting good or excellent 
     abilities to find and judge health information for their patients. 
     The proportion of students who envisioned searching a database to 
     help manage a challenging clinical case decreased from 96% to 89% (p 
     > .05). The proportion seeing themselves submitting a case report for 
     publication declined from 16% to 4% (p ≤ .05). Conclusion: 
     Students' self-perceived CRL abilities and knowledge improved between 
     the beginning and end of their DCP; however, their attitudes toward 
     applying these in practice declined.]

     AB: Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the behaviors, 
     attitudes, and beliefs of attendees of a chiropractic research 
     conference (which included chiropractic students, clinicians, 
     researchers, and educators) toward chronic low back pain (CLBP) 
     before and after a biopsychosocial (BPS)-based CLBP educational 
     workshop. Methods: This single-arm intervention study used the Health 
     Care Providers' Pain and Relationship Scale (HC-PAIRS) and 
     CLBP-related clinic vignettes to assess behaviors, attitudes, and 
     beliefs toward CLBP before and after a single 90-minute educational 
     workshop. The HC-PAIRS is a self-reporting questionnaire that 
     consists of 15 items rated on a 7-point rating scale, with a higher 
     score suggesting a belief that pain is linked to movement and that 
     recommendations should be given to avoid physical activities. 
     Results: The pre-education intervention HC-PAIRS and vignettes were 
     completed by 40 of 56 attendees. A total of 18 participants completed 
     the posteducation intervention HC-PAIRS and CLBP-related clinical 
     vignettes. Most of participants identified as full-time clinicians, 
     employees of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and 
     musculoskeletal/neuromusculoskeletal providers. The pre-education 
     intervention HC-PAIRS mean score was 44.8 (SD 9.22), and the 
     postscore was 39.5 (SD 6.49). Conclusion: Findings suggest an 
     immediate change in HC-PAIRS scores following a BPS-focused CLBP 
     education intervention for a chiropractic audience. However, due to 
     limitations related to sample size and target population, findings 
     should be interpreted cautiously.]

     test (400 m WT) in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: A 
     systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE, 
     resulting in the inclusion of 50 studies with data from in total 
     19,266 participants (mean age 63.2-84.3). Data were extracted and 
     properties were given a sufficient or insufficient overall rating 
     following the COSMIN guideline for systematic reviews of 
     patient-reported outcome measures. Quality of evidence (QoE) was 
     rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development 
     and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: The SPPB was evaluated in 
     12 studies, TUG in 30, 4 m GST in 12 and 400 m WT in 2. Reliability 
     of the SPPB, TUG and 4 m GST was rated sufficient (moderate to good 
     QoE). The measurement error of the SPPB was rated insufficient (low 
     QoE). Criterion validity for the SPPB was insufficient in indicating 
     sarcopenia (moderate QoE), while the TUG was sufficient and 
     insufficient for determining mobility limitations (low QoE) and 
     activities of daily living disability (low QoE), respectively. 
     Construct validity of the SPPB, TUG, 4 m GST and 400 m WT was rated 
     insufficient in many constructs (moderate to high QoE). 
     Responsiveness was rated as insufficient for SPPB (high QoE) and TUG 
     (very low QoE), while 4 m GST was rated as sufficient (high QoE).]

     AB: Background: Epigenetic ageing is among the most promising ageing 
     biomarkers and may be a useful marker of physical function decline, 
     beyond chronological age. This study investigated whether epigenetic 
     age acceleration (AA) is associated with the change in frailty scores 
     over 7 years and the 7-year risk of incident frailty and persistent 
     Activities of Daily Living (ADL) disability among 560 Australians 
     (50.7% females) aged ≥70 years. Methods: Seven AA indices, 
     including GrimAge, GrimAge2, FitAge and DunedinPACE, were estimated 
     from baseline peripheral-blood DNA-methylation. Frailty was assessed 
     using both the 67-item deficit-accumulation frailty index (FI) and 
     Fried phenotype (Fried). Persistent ADL disability was defined as 
     loss of ability to perform one or more basic ADLs for at least 6 
     months. Linear mixed models and Cox proportional-hazard regression 
     models were used as appropriate. Results: Accelerated GrimAge, 
     GrimAge2, FitAge and DunedinPACE at baseline were associated with 
     increasing FI scores per year (adjusted-Beta ranged from 0.0015 to 
     0.0021, P < 0.05), and accelerated GrimAge and GrimAge2 were 
     associated with an increased risk of incident FI-defined frailty 
     (adjusted-HRs 1.43 and 1.39, respectively, P < 0.05). The association 
     between DunedinPACE and the change in FI scores was stronger in 
     females (adjusted-Beta 0.0029, P 0.001 than in males (adjusted-Beta 
     0.0002, P 0.81). DunedinPACE, but not the other AA measures, was also 
     associated with worsening Fried scores (adjusted-Beta 0.0175, P 
     0.04). No associations were observed with persistent ADL disability. 
     Conclusion: Epigenetic AA in later life is associated with increasing 
     frailty scores per year and the risk of incident FI-defined frailty.]

     AB: Background: Dementia caregiving is a dynamic and multidimensional 
     process. To gain a comprehensive understanding of informal caregiving 
     for people living with dementia (PLWD), it is pivotal to assess the 
     quality of life (QoL) of informal caregivers. Objective: To evaluate 
     whether the care-recipient relationship type predicts changes in the 
     QoL of informal caregivers of PLWD over a two-year period. Methods: 
     This was a secondary analysis of longitudinal data. The data were 
     drawn from two waves of linked data from the National Health and 
     Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and the National Study of Caregiving 
     (NSOC) (2015: NHATS R5 & NSOC II; 2017: NHATS R7 & NSOC III). 
     Caregivers were categorized into spousal, adult-child, "other" 
     caregiver and "multiple" caregivers. QoL was assessed through 
     negative emotional burden (NEB), positive emotional benefits and 
     social strain (SS). Generalized estimating equation modelling was 
     used to examine changes in caregivers' QoL outcomes across types of 
     relationship over time. Results: About, 882 caregivers were included 
     who linked to 601 PLWD. After adjusting caregivers' 
     socio-demographics, "other" caregivers had lower risk of NEB and SS 
     than spousal caregivers (OR = 0.34, P = 0.003, 95%CI [0.17, 0.70]; OR 
     = 0.37, P = 0.019, 95%CI 0.16, 0.85], respectively), and PLWD's 
     dementia status would not change these significance (OR = 0.33, P = 
     0.003, 95%CI [0.16, 0.68]; OR = 0.31, P = 0.005, 95%CI [0.14, 0.71], 
     respectively). Conclusions; The study demonstrates that spousal 
     caregivers face a higher risk of NEB and SS over time, underscoring 
     the pressing need to offer accessible and effective support for 
     informal caregivers of PLWD, especially those caring for their 
     spouses.]

     AB: Clinical conversations surrounding the continuation or limitation 
     of life-sustaining therapies (LLST) are both challenging and 
     tragically necessary for patients with disorders of consciousness 
     (DoC) following severe brain injury. Divergent cultural, 
     philosophical and religious perspectives contribute to vast 
     heterogeneity in clinical approaches to LLST-as reflected in regional 
     differences and inter-clinician variability. Here we provide an 
     ethical analysis of factors that inform LLST decisions among patients 
     with DoC. We begin by introducing the clinical and ethical challenge 
     and clarifying the distinction between withdrawing and withholding 
     life-sustaining therapy. We then describe relevant factors that 
     influence LLST decision-making including diagnostic and prognostic 
     uncertainty, perception of pain, defining a 'good' outcome, and the 
     role of clinicians. In concluding sections, we explore global 
     variation in LLST practices as they pertain to patients with DoC and 
     examine the impact of cultural and religious perspectives on 
     approaches to LLST. Understanding and respecting the cultural and 
     religious perspectives of patients and surrogates is essential to 
     protecting patient autonomy and advancing goal-concordant care during 
     critical moments of medical decision-making involving patients with 
     DoC.]

     AB: Background: A novel interspinous fixation system based on 
     anatomical parameters and incorporating transfacetopedicular screws, 
     was developed to treat degenerative disc diseases. The biomechanical 
     characteristics of the novel system were evaluated using finite 
     element analysis in comparison to other classical interspinous 
     spacers. Methods: The L1-S1 lumbar spine finite element models were 
     surgically implanted with the novel system, Coflex and DIAM devices 
     at the L4/L5 segment to assess the range of motion, the pression 
     distribution of intervertebral disc, the peak stresses on the spinous 
     process and implant during various motions. Findings: Range of 
     motions of the L4/L5 surgical segment were reduced by 29.13%, 61.27%, 
     77.35%, 33.33%, and the peak stresses of intervertebral disc were 
     decreased by 36.82%, 67.31%, 73.00%, 69.57% for the novel system in 
     flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation when compared 
     with the Coflex, and they were declined by 34.53%, 57.86%, 75.81%, 
     25.21%; 36.22%, 67.31%, 75.01%, 71.40% compared with DIAM. The 
     maximum stresses of the spinous process were 29.93 MPa, 24.66 MPa, 
     14.45 MPa, 24.37 MPa in the novel system, and those of Coflex and 
     DIAM were 165.3 MPa, 109 MPa, 84.79 MPa, 47.66 MPa and 52.59 MPa, 
     48.78 MPa, 50.27 MPa, 44.16 MPa during the same condition. 
     Interpretation: Compared to other interspinous spacer devices, the 
     novel interspinous fixation system demonstrated excellent stability, 
     effectively distributing load on the intervertebral disc, and 
     reducing the risk of spinous process fractures. The personalized 
     design of the novel interspinous fixation system could be a viable 
     option for treating degenerative disc diseases.]

     AB: Background: Total knee replacements are used to improve function 
     and reduce pain in patients with advanced osteoarthritis. The 
     medially stabilising implant is designed to mimic a healthy knee. 
     This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the kinematics 
     and kinetics of a medially stabilising knee implant, comparing it to 
     a healthy control group, as well as to its pre-operative state and 
     the contralateral limb. Methods: Sixteen total knee replacement 
     patients and ten healthy participants were recruited. Patients 
     underwent testing 4-6 weeks before surgery and repeated the same 
     tests 12 months after surgery. Healthy participants completed the 
     same tests at a single time point. All participants completed three 
     walking trials: kinematics was captured with eight cameras; kinetics 
     with in-ground force plates. Subject-specific musculoskeletal models 
     were developed in OpenSim. Inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics 
     were used to determine gait parameters. Joint angles and joint 
     moments were evaluated using Statistical Parametric Mapping. 
     Patient-reported outcome measures were also collected at both time 
     points. Findings: Spatiotemporal results indicate significant 
     differences in velocity and step length between pre-operative 
     patients and control participants. Differences are observed in the 
     adduction angles between the contralateral and ipsilateral limbs 
     pre-operatively. Postoperatively, there was an increase in the 1st 
     peak flexion moment, reduced adduction moment and reduced internal 
     rotation moment. In PROMs, patients all report improvements in pain

     AB: Background: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 
     proinflammatory cytokines correlate with knee loading mechanics 
     during gait following a mechanical walking stimulus in subjects 2 
     years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Elevated 
     systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines can be sustained for 
     years after injury. Considering roughly 50% of these patients 
     progress to Osteoarthritis 10-15 years after injury, a better 
     understanding of the role of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor 
     necrosis factor-α and Interleukin-1β on Osteoarthritis risk is 
     needed. Methods: Serum proinflammatory cytokines concentrations were 
     measured in 21 subjects 2 years after unilateral ACLR from blood 
     drawn at rest and 3.5 h after 30 min of walking. An optoelectronic 
     system and a force plate measured subjects' knee kinetics. 
     Correlations were tested between inflammatory marker response and 
     knee extension and knee adduction moments. Findings: Changes in 
     proinflammatory cytokines due to mechanical stimulus were correlated 
     (R = 0.86) and showed substantial variation between subjects in both 
     cytokines at 3.5 h post-walk. Knee loading correlated with 3.5-h 
     changes in tumor necrosis factor-α concentration (Knee extension 
     moment: R = -0.5, Knee adduction moment: R = -0.5) and 
     Interleukin-1β concentration (Knee extension moment: R = -0.44). 
     However, no significant changes in concentrations were observed in 
     tumor necrosis factor-α and Interleukin-1β when comparing baseline 
     and post walking stimulus conditions. Interpretation: The significant 
     associations between changes in serum proinflammatory markers 
     following a mechanical stimulus and gait metrics in subjects at risk 
     for developing Osteoarthritis underscore the importance of 
     investigating the interaction between biomarkers and biomechanical 
     factors in Osteoarthritis development.]

     AB: Background: Effectiveness of therapeutic footwear in reducing 
     peak pressure in persons with diabetes and loss of protective 
     sensation to prevent diabetic foot ulcers varies due to manual 
     production and possible changing foot structure. A previous two-way 
     approach to address this issue, featuring individualized 3D-printed 
     rocker midsoles and self-adjusting insoles, proved effective in the 
     forefoot but less in the heel. To address this, new insoles 
     incorporating a heel cup are developed. Methods: In-shoe pressure was 
     measured, while persons with diabetes and loss of protective 
     sensation with high peak pressure (≥ 200 kPa) in the heel walked on 
     a treadmill with control and individualized rocker shoe paired with 
     control and new insole. Findings: Generalized estimating equations 
     revealed significant decrease in peak pressure in the proximal heel 
     with the new insole alone and combined with rocker shoe compared to 
     rocker shoe alone. For the distal heel, significant decrease in peak 
     pressure is shown with the combination of new insole and rocker shoe 
     compared to control shoe. For the forefoot and toes (excluding 
     hallux) significant decrease in peak pressure is shown using the 
     rocker shoe alone or combined with the heel cup compared to control 
     shoe. Interpretation: The new insole paired with rocker shoe is 
     effective in reducing peak pressure in the distal heel. To have 
     similar (or more) success in proximal heel, one could replace the 
     rocker midsole with more compliant materials. The rocker shoe used 
     separately or combined with a heel cup effectively reduces the peak 
     pressure in the forefoot and other toes.]

     MD: AB]
     AB: Background: Community ambulation involves complex walking 
     adaptability tasks such as stepping over obstacles or taking long 
     steps, which require adequate propulsion generation by the trailing 
     leg. Individuals post-stroke often have an increased reliance on 
     their trailing nonparetic leg and favor leading with their paretic 
     leg, which can limit mobility. Ankle-foot-orthoses are prescribed to 
     address common deficits post-stroke such as foot drop and ankle 
     instability. However, it is not clear if walking with an 
     ankle-foot-orthosis improves inter-limb propulsion symmetry during 
     adaptability tasks. This study sought to examine this hypothesis. 
     Methods: Individuals post-stroke (n = 9) that were previously 
     prescribed a custom fabricated plantarflexion-stop articulated 
     ankle-foot-orthosis participated. Participants performed steady-state 
     walking and adaptability tasks overground with and without their 
     orthosis. The adaptability tasks included obstacle crossing and 
     long-step tasks, leading with both their paretic and nonparetic leg. 
     Inter-limb propulsion symmetry was calculated using trailing limb 
     ground-reaction-forces. Findings: During the obstacle crossing task, 
     ankle-foot-orthosis use resulted in a significant improvement in 
     inter-limb propulsion symmetry. The orthosis also improved ankle 
     dorsiflexion during stance, reduced knee hyperextension, increased 
     gastrocnemius muscle activity, and increased peak paretic leg ankle 
     plantarflexor moment. In contrast, there were no differences in 
     propulsion symmetry during steady-state walking and taking a 
     long-step when using the orthosis. Interpretation: 
     Plantarflexion-stop articulated ankle-foot-orthoses can improve 
     propulsion symmetry during obstacle crossing tasks in individuals 
     post-stroke, promoting paretic leg use and reduced reliance on the 
     nonparetic leg.]

     AB: Aim: We compared three different intensities of robot-assisted 
     gait training (RAGT) for achieving favourable outcomes in children 
     with cerebral palsy (CP). Method: This study was conducted using a 
     randomized controlled, single-blind design. Thirty children (19 males 
     and 11 females; mean age 6 years 1 month, SD 2 years) with CP 
     classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels II 
     and III were assigned to three different RAGT intensity groups: 
     high-intensity (fastest walking speed and lowest body weight support 
     [BWS]), low-intensity (slowest speed and highest BWS), and 
     comfortable intensity (intermediate speed and intermediate BWS). The 
     RAGT intervention was performed three times a week for 6 weeks. 
     Outcome measures included the 88-item Gross Motor Function Measure, 
     stability index, spatiotemporal parameters of gait analysis, 
     paediatric functional independence measure, and the Canadian 
     Occupational Performance Measure. Results: The 88-item Gross Motor 
     Function Measure was significantly improved after training in the 
     high-intensity (D Δ8.3 ± 15.6; E Δ3.8 ± 4.1) and comfortable 
     intensity (D Δ2.9 ± 3.1; E Δ1.2 ± 2.0) groups, whereas gait speed 
     was improved in the comfortable intensity group, without 
     statistically significant group differences. Only the low-intensity 
     group showed improvement on the stability index (Δ −0.6 ± 0.9, p 
     = 0.05). Everyday functional performance significantly improved in 
     all three groups, with the comfortable intensity group showing the 
     greatest improvement. Interpretation: Different training intensities 
     produced improvement in different areas; individualized RAGT 
     intensity adjustment is therefore needed based on the rehabilitation 
     goal.]

     AB: Introduction: The use of hypnotic drugs is common in the elderly 
     and is associated with negative health outcomes. Our aim was to 
     evaluate the prevalence of hypnotic drug usage amongst hip fracture 
     patients undergoing a rehabilitation program and investigate any 
     potential associations between hypnotic drug use and rehabilitation 
     outcomes in a post-acute care setting. Methods: A retrospective 
     analysis of 440 geriatric hip fracture patients was conducted from 
     1/1/2019 to 12/2021 in a geriatric rehabilitation center. The main 
     outcome measures were the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the 
     motor FIM effectiveness and length of stay (LOS). Results: Two 
     hundred and twenty-eight (51.7 %) patients out of the entire cohort 
     (440)), were prescribed hypnotic drugs. These patients exhibited a 
     significantly lower rate of diabetes (p = 0.025), a higher rate of 
     depression (p = 0.003), and lower albumin levels (p = 0.023) upon 
     admission to rehabilitation in comparison to untreated patients. No 
     significant differences were observed between the two patient groups 
     in functional rehabilitation outcomes or LOS. Moreover, no 
     correlation was established between the hypnotic drug burden during 
     rehabilitation and the outcome measures. Furthermore, no significant 
     differences were found between patients treated with hypnotic drugs 
     on admission and those who were prescribed these drugs during 
     rehabilitation. The type of hypnotic drug did not affect these 
     results. Conclusion: The use of hypnotic drugs by elderly individuals 
     undergoing a rehabilitation program after a hip fracture is unlikely 
     to have an adverse impact on their short-term rehabilitation 
     outcomes. Consequently, there may not be an immediate necessity to 
     discontinue these drugs upon admission. Nevertheless, the use of 
     hypnotic drugs should be approached with caution and minimized 
     whenever possible due to an increased fall risk and other adverse 
     effects.]

     AB: Background: Financial incentives in capitated Medicare Advantage 
     (MA) plans may lead to inadequate rehabilitation. We therefore 
     investigated if MA enrollees had worse long-term physical performance 
     and functional outcomes after rehabilitation. Methods: We conducted a 
     retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries in the 
     nationally representative National Health and Aging Trends Study. We 
     compared MA and fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries reporting 
     rehabilitation between 2014 and 2017 by change in (1) Short Physical 
     Performance Battery (SPPB) and (2) NHATS-derived Functional 
     Independence Measure (FIM) from the previous year, using t-tests 
     incorporating inverse-probability weighting and complex survey 
     design. Secondary outcomes were self-reported: (1) improved function 
     during rehabilitation, (2) worse function since rehabilitation ended, 
     (3) meeting rehabilitation goals, and (4) meeting insurance limits. 
     Results: Among 738 MA and 1488 FFS participants, weighted mean age 
     was 76 years (SD 7.0), 59% were female, and 9% had probable dementia. 
     MA beneficiaries were more likely to be Black (9% vs. 6%) or 
     Hispanic/other race (15% vs. 10%), be on Medicaid (14% vs. 10%), have 
     lower income (median $35,000 vs. $48,000), and receive <1 month of 
     rehabilitation (30% vs. 23%). MA beneficiaries had a similar decline 
     in SPPB (−0.46 [SD 1.8] vs. −0.21 [SD 2.7], p-value 0.069) and 
     adapted FIM (−1.05 [SD 3.7] vs. −1.13 [SD 5.45], p-value 0.764) 
     compared to FFS. MA beneficiaries were less likely to report improved 
     function during rehabilitation (61% [95% CI 56-67] vs. 70% [95% CI 
     67-74], p-value 0.006). Other outcomes and analyses restricted to 
     inpatient rehabilitation participants were non-significant. 
     Conclusions and: Relevance: MA enrollment was associated with lower 
     likelihood of self-reported functional improvement during 
     rehabilitation but no clinically or statistically significant 
     differences in annual changes of physical performance or function. As 
     MA expands, future studies must monitor implications on 
     rehabilitation coverage and older adults' independence.]

     AB: Background: Multimorbidity and functional limitation are 
     associated with poor outcomes in heart failure (HF). However, the 
     individual and combined effect of these on health-related quality of 
     life in patients with HF is not well understood. Methods: Patients 
     aged ≥30 years with two or more HF diagnostic codes and one or more 
     HF-related prescription drugs from four U.S. institutions were mailed 
     a survey to measure patient-centric factors including functional 
     status (activities of daily living [ADLs]) and health-related quality 
     of life (PROMIS-29 Health Profile). Patients with HF from January 1, 
     2013 to February 1, 2018 were included. Multimorbidity was defined as 
     ≥2 non-cardiovascular comorbidities; functional limitation as any 
     limitation in at least one of eight ADLs. Patients were categorized 
     into four groups by multimorbidity (Yes/No) and functional limitation 
     (Yes/No). We dichotomized the PROMIS-29 sub-scale scores at the 
     median and calculated odd ratios for the four 
     multimorbidity/functional limitation groups. Results: A total of 3330 
     patients with HF returned the survey (response rate 31%); 3020 
     completed the questions of interest and were retained. Among these 
     patients (45% female; mean age 73 [standard deviation: 12] years), 
     29% had neither multimorbidity nor functional limitation, 24% had 
     multimorbidity only, 22% had functional limitation only, and 25% had 
     both. After adjustment, having functional limitation only was 
     associated with higher anxiety (odds ratio [OR]: 3.44, 95% confidence 
     interval [CI]: 2.66-4.45), depression (OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 2.39-4.06), 
     and fatigue (OR: 4.19, 95% CI: 3.25-5.40); worse sleep (OR: 2.14, 95% 
     CI: 1.69-2.72) and pain (OR: 6.73, 95% CI: 5.15-8.78); and greater 
     difficulty with social activities (OR: 9.40, 95% CI: 7.19-12.28) 
     compared with having neither. Results were similar for having both 
     multimorbidity and functional limitation. Conclusion: Patients with 
     only functional limitation have similar poor health-related quality 
     of life scores as those with both multimorbidity and functional 
     limitation, underscoring the important role that physical functioning 
     plays in the well-being of patients with HF.]

     care for nursing home (NH) residents with dementia. Despite the 
     important role of family, little is known about the availability and 
     characteristics of families of persons with dementia who die in NHs. 
     Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 18,339 individuals 
     65 years and older with dementia who died in a Utah NH between 1998 
     and 2016, linked to their first-degree family (FDF) members (n = 
     52,566; spouses = 11.3%; children = 58.3%; siblings = 30.3%). 
     Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and t-tests were used to 
     describe the study cohort and their FDF members and to compare 
     sociodemographic and death characteristics of NH decedents with (n = 
     14,398; 78.5%) and without FDF (n = 3941; 21.5%). Results: Compared 
     with NH decedents with FDF, NH decedents with dementia without FDF 
     members were more likely to be older (mean age 86.5 vs 85.5), female 
     (70.5% vs 59.3%), non-White/Hispanic (9.9% vs 3.2%), 
     divorced/separated/widowed (84.4% vs 61.1%), less educated (<12th 
     grade; 42.2% vs 33.7%), have Medicare and Medicaid (20.8% vs 12.5%), 
     and die in a rural/frontier NH (25.0% vs 23.4%). NH decedents who did 
     not have FDF were also more likely to die from cancer (4.2% vs 3.9%), 
     chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 3.9% vs 2.5%), and 
     dementia (40.5% vs 38.4%) and were less likely to have 2+ inpatient 
     hospitalizations at EOL (13.9% vs 16.2%), compared with NH decedents 
     with FDF. Conclusions: Findings highlight differences in social 
     determinants of health (e.g. sex, race, marital status, education, 
     insurance, rurality) between NH decedents with dementia who do and do 
     not have FDF-factors that may influence equity in EOL care. 
     Understanding the role of family availability and familial 
     characteristics on EOL care outcomes for NH residents with dementia 
     is an important next step to informing NH dementia care interventions 
     and health policies]

     AB: Background: The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical 
     support tool for osteoporosis clinic providers to support risk 
     assessment and referrals for evidence-based exercise therapy 
     programs. Methods: A sequential Delphi method was used with a 
     multidisciplinary group of national falls experts, to provide 
     consensus on referral to exercise therapy for patients at risk for 
     falls. The Delphi study included a primary research team, expert 
     panel, and clinical partners to answer the questions: (1) "What 
     patient characteristics are needed to develop a clinical support 
     tool?"; (2) "What are the recommended exercise referrals for patients 
     with osteoporosis at risk for falls?" The consensus process consisted 
     of two rounds with 8 weeks between meetings. Two qualitative 
     researchers analyzed the data using a modified version of a matrix 
     analysis approach. Results: The following were the most important 
     variables to include when determining exercise therapy referrals for 
     patients with osteoporosis: Patient history and demographics, falls 
     history over the last year, current physical function and balance, 
     caregiver and transportation status, socioeconomic and insurance 
     status, and patient preference. Potential exercise therapy referrals 
     included one-on-one physical therapy, group physical therapy, home 
     health, community-based exercise programs, and not acceptable for 
     exercise therapy. Conclusions: Patient characteristics including 
     patient history, physical function and balance performance, 
     socioeconomic and insurance status, and patient preference for 
     exercise therapy are important to inform both the medical provider 
     and patient with osteoporosis to choose the most appropriate exercise 
     therapy referral. Adoption of the algorithmic suggestions may have a 
     significant impact on uptake and adherence to exercise therapy, 
     ultimately improving patient physical function and reducing falls

     Method: A clustered randomised controlled trial (cRCT), with an 
     embedded process evaluation, was used to test the feasibility of a 
     school-based walking intervention. Eight schools (n = 161 pupils aged 
     9-13 years) were randomised into either an intervention arm or an 
     'exercise as usual' arm. Measures included physical activity, 
     physical fitness and emotional wellbeing. Baseline and 3-month 
     follow-up data were collected. Results: The 'Walk Buds' intervention 
     was found to be acceptable to teaching staff and pupils, with an 
     uptake rate of the walking sessions offered of 84%. Conclusion: A 
     number of challenges were experienced, relating to the COVID-19 
     pandemic, and difficulties collecting accelerometer data. Barriers, 
     facilitators and required changes identified through the mixed 
     methods process evaluation are discussed.]

     AB: Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive 
     neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately 1%-2% of 
     individuals aged 60 and above. Communication disorders in PD can 
     significantly impact the overall quality of life. As prosody plays a 
     vital role in verbal communication, the present study examines 
     Persian prosody perception in PD, focusing on linguistic and 
     emotional aspects of prosody. Methods: This cross-sectional study 
     aimed to compare the perception of linguistic and emotional prosody 
     in three groups: middle-aged adults (n = 22; mean age = 50.40 years), 
     healthy older adults (n = 22; mean age = 68.31 years), and 
     individuals with Parkinson's disease (n = 22; mean age = 65years). 
     All individuals with PD were classified in stages 1; 1.5; 2; 2.5, and 
     3 of the disease using the Hoehn and Yahr scale. All participants had 
     an MMSE score of 24 or above. The Florida Affect Battery (FAB) was 
     used to evaluate prosody perception. This Battery was validated in 
     the Persian language and its reliability and validity were reported 
     as 94 % and 100 % respectively. Results: Participants with PD 
     presented significantly lower scores than the older adults in all 
     subtests of the FAB (p < 0.05), while healthy older adults were 
     significantly different only in linguistic discrimination (β = 
     -2.14; -3.68 to -0.61), and linguistic naming of prosody (β = 1.25; 
     0.17 to 2.33) compared to middle-aged adults. Conclusions: The 
     present study sheds light on the influence of PD on Persian prosody 
     perception. Given the crucial role of prosody in verbal 
     communication, these findings enhance our understanding of 
     communication disorders in PD and could bring attention to consider 
     prosody perception, among other aspects, when assessing individuals 
     affected by PD.]

     disorder (DLD) and those with typical language (TL) functioning.. 
     Method: Twenty-four adults (12 DLD, 12 TL) were assigned to either 
     the guilty or not guilty conditions. Those in the guilty condition 
     engaged in a mock crime while those in the not guilty condition were 
     informed that a crime had been committed. Peer jurors were presented 
     with video interrogations of the DLD (6 guilty, 6 not guilty) and TL 
     (6 guilty, 6 not guilty) participants and were asked to make 
     categorical judgments of guilty and not guilty and to indicate 
     confidence in their judgments. Results: In general, peer jurors were 
     not accurate in their judgments of the accused, and were more likely 
     to judge individuals with DLD as guilty relative to accused 
     individuals with TL. Peer jurors were particularly poor at judging 
     innocent adults with DLD as not guilty and guilty adults with TL as 
     guilty. Despite this, peer jurors were more confident than not in 
     their guilty and not guilty determinations. Conclusions: Peer jurors 
     are confident in their judgments of the guilt of the accused when 
     they should not be, particularly in the case of accused adults with 
     DLD. Implications are discussed.]

     AB: Introduction: Prosody is used to express indexical (identifying 
     the talker), linguistic (e.g. question intonation, lexical stress), 
     pragmatic (e.g. contrastive stress, sarcasm), and emotional/affective 
     functions. It is manifested through changes in fundamental frequency 
     (f0), intensity, and duration. F0 and intensity are degraded when 
     perceived through a cochlear implant (CI). The purpose of this 
     meta-analysis is to compare expressive prosody in speech produced by 
     CI users versus normal hearing peers. Methods: A systematic search of 
     the literature found 25 articles that met all inclusion criteria. 
     These articles were assessed for quality, and data pertaining to the 
     expression of f0, intensity, and duration, as well as classification 
     accuracy and appropriateness ratings from normal hearing listeners, 
     were extracted and meta-analyzed using random effects models. 
     Results: The articles included in the meta-analysis were generally of 
     acceptable or high quality. Meta-analyses revealed significant 
     differences between individuals with CIs vs. normal hearing on all 
     measures except mean f0, mean intensity, and rhythm. Effect sizes 
     were generally medium to large. There was significant heterogeneity 
     across studies, but little evidence of publication bias. Conclusions: 
     CI users speak with less variable f0, smaller f0 contours, more 
     variable intensity, a slower speech rate, and reduced final 
     lengthening at syntactic boundaries. These acoustic differences are 
     reflected in significantly poorer ratings of speech produced by CI 
     users compared to their normal hearing peers, as assessed by groups 
     of normal hearing listeners. Because atypical expressive prosody is 
     associated with negative outcomes, clinicians should consider 
     targeting prosody when working with individuals who use CIs.]

     AB: Purpose: Prior research has revealed people who stutter 
     experience role entrapment in which they are discouraged from 
     pursuing certain careers over others. The Vocational Advice Scale 
     (VAS; Gabel et al. 2004) is a reliable survey previously used to 
     investigate this phenomenon. This study used the VAS to determine if 
     communication skills required for careers influences reports of role 
     entrapment. Method: An online survey which included the VAS and 
     perceptions of communication skills needed for each career listed on 
     the VAS was distributed. Correlations between items on the two 
     surveys were completed to investigate how communication skills 
     influences the presence of role entrapment. In addition, a one-way 
     analysis of variance was completed to explore differences between 
     individuals who regularly provide career advice with those who do 
     not. Results: Analysis found a significant correlation between 
     perceived communication skills required for a career and the advice 
     provided. As the perceived communication skills needed for a career 
     increases, the likelihood of someone advising a person who stutters 
     to pursue that career decreases. A one-way analysis of variance 
     further revealed participants who regularly provide career advice did 
     not differ from those participants who do not. Conclusion: Perceived 
     communication abilities needed for a career is a significant 
     indicator of role entrapment towards people who stutter. Results 
     agree with previous studies which found differences in advisability 
     of certain careers over others for people who stutter, especially 
     those which require communication within challenging situations (e.g. 
     judge, attorney).]

     AB: Background: Differences in core auditory processing abilities, 
     such as sound timing, frequency discrimination, auditory perception, 
     and auditory memory, have been suggested in stutterers, despite the 
     fact that the precise origin of stuttering is not entirely 
     understood. It is suggested that these differences may play a role in 
     the development of stuttering. The aim of our study is to assess the 
     temporal central auditory processing performance in individuals with 
     stuttering and compare it to individuals without stuttering to 
     uncover potential differences stuttering and compare it to 
     individuals without stuttering to reveal potential differences. 
     Method: In current study, a total of 60 right-handed participants 
     between the ages of 8 and 17 were included, divided into two balanced 
     groups based on age, education, and gender: individuals with 
     stuttering (n = 30) and individuals without stuttering (n = 30). All 
     participants underwent the Frequency Pattern Test, Duration Pattern 
     Test, and Gaps-In-Noise test. Results; Individuals who stutter showed 
     lower performance in the gap detection threshold and the percentage 
     of total correct gap identification parameters of the Frequency 
     Pattern Test, Duration Pattern Test, and Gaps-In-Noise test compared 
     to fluent speakers. Conclusions: The findings indicate a potential 
     relationship between stuttering and central auditory processing. In 
     this context, incorporating central auditory processing measures into 
     the assessment and therapy processes for stuttering may enhance the 
     likelihood of obtaining more accurate results]

     AB: Purpose: To document the trajectory of early childhood stuttering 
     longitudinally for 14. years with a consideration on the features of 
     overt and covert stuttering related to recovery status. Method: 
     Thirty-eight participants were observed longitudinally at three 
     different time points: early childhood (Occasion 1), middle childhood 
     (Occasion 2), and late adolescence (Occasion 3). Data collection 
     involved speech samples and reports of stuttering experiences. 
     Recovery on Occasion 3 was estimated through analysis of speech 
     samples, parent and expert judgments, and self- judgement. Two 
     categories of persistence were used: persistent-subjective (no 
     observable stuttering) and persistent-objective (observable 
     stuttering). Results: The recovery rate was 65.6 %. The majority of 
     the participants showed minimal disfluent speech with 88 % showing 
     less than 1 % syllables stuttered and 97 % showing less than 3 % 
     syllables stuttered in the collected speech samples. All participants 
     classified as persistent reported covert symptoms of stuttering. No 
     relapses in recovery were observed between Occasion 2 and Occasion 3. 
     Late recovery was only observed for those classified as 
     persistent-subjective on Occasion 2. About 64 % of the participants 
     showing observable stuttering (persistent-objective) on Occasion 2 
     showed no observable stuttering (persistent-subjective) on Occasion 
     3. Conclusions: Children continue to recover from early childhood 
     stuttering as they age.The inclusion of self-reports adds to the 
     understanding of recovery especially concerning the covert stuttering 
     behaviours. The presence of overt symptoms of stuttering in the 
     speech samples of children aged 7 to 13 years seems to be associated 
     with the likelihood of late recovery of stuttering]

     their lives, and investigate the association between the number of 
     different types of major discrimination events experienced and 
     quality of life. Methods: Measures of quality of life (Kemp Quality 
     of Life Scale) and major discrimination (adapted Major Experiences of 
     Discrimination Scale) were completed by 303 adults who stutter. 
     Correlational and regression analyses were conducted with these 
     variables. Results: A majority (56%) of the participants had 
     experienced at least one episode of major discrimination due to 
     stuttering during their lives. The major discrimination experiences 
     most commonly reported included not being hired for a job and being 
     discouraged by a teacher or advisor from pursuing certain careers or 
     jobs because of stuttering. There was a significant negative 
     relationship between quality of life and major discrimination. 
     Increased major discrimination predicted lower quality of life even 
     after taking into account demographic variables and severity of 
     physical speech disruption. Conclusions: The findings of a negative 
     association between major discrimination and quality of life add 
     support to the notion that reducing societal stigma related to 
     stuttering should be a priority of the field. Discriminatory 
     practices of listeners constitute a social-environmental barrier to

     Quality of Life Assessment protocol (IQOLA) was applied to translate 
     SGSM into Persian. The face and content validity were determined. 
     Also, the discriminant validity was evaluated by comparing the scores 
     of two groups. In addition, the internal consistency test-retest, and 
     inter-judge reliability were assessed with Cronbach's alpha and 
     intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Moreover, the mean 
     standardized response (MSR) and the standardized effect size were 
     measured to determine the internal responsiveness using pre- and 
     post-treatment data. Results: All the items were comprehensible and 
     clear. The content validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index 
     (CVI) for all nine questions were obtained higher than.62 and.9, 
     respectively. The internal consistency value was high (Cronbach's 
     alpha =.98). For the test-retest reliability, ICC values were 
     excellent, ranging from.93 to.99. The discriminant validity results 
     revealed a significant difference between AWS and AWNS (p < .001). 
     Pre- and post-treatment results indicated high internal 
     responsiveness to changes for percentage of syllable stuttered (SS%) 
     (MSR = 1.09). Conclusion: The Persian version of SGSM (P-SGSM) 
     benefits from the high values for validity and reliability. 
     Furthermore, it distinguishes the AWS and AWNS and reflects the 
     treatment changes significantly.]

     AB: Introduction: Preschool-age children use mental state verbs 
     (MSVs; e.g. think, know) to reference thoughts and other cognitive 
     states. In play-based language, MSV use requires conversational 
     flexibility, as speakers shift from discussion of actions happening 
     in the here-and-now to more abstract discussion of mental states. 
     Some evidence suggests that children who stutter (CWS) demonstrate 
     subtle differences in shifting on experimental tasks of cognitive 
     flexibility, differences which may extend to conversational 
     flexibility. This study explored MSV use in conversational language 
     between CWS and their mothers. Methods: Thirty-five preschool-age CWS 
     and 35 age- and gender-matched children who do not stutter (CWNS), 
     all performing within the typical range on standardized language 
     testing, conversed with their mothers during play. Samples were 
     transcribed and coded for MSV use. Results: No between-group 
     differences were observed in MSV use, either between the CWS and CWNS 
     or between the groups of mothers. Age and language skills were 
     positively associated with MSV use in the CWNS group only. For both 
     groups of dyads, mothers' MSV use corresponded at least to some 
     extent to their children's language skills. Finally, correspondence 
     between CWNS and their mothers was observed for two conversational 
     language measures, representing lexical diversity and morphosyntax; 
     this overall pattern was not observed in the CWS dyad group. 
     Conclusions: Although these findings point to similar use of MSVs 
     among the groups of children and their mothers, for the CWS group, 
     the patterns of use in relation to age and language skills are 
     somewhat different from developmental expectations.]

     (i.e. trait social anxiety) and situational factors (i.e. social 
     partner reaction, communication channel type, social closeness, 
     stuttering knowledge). Method: AWS completed ecological momentary 
     assessments on their smartphones multiple times a day for up to three 
     weeks. Data (n = 62) were analyzed with multilevel models to 
     determine how situational factors and trait social anxiety influence 
     the Negative Affect (NA), Positive Affect (PA), and self-reported 
     stuttering severity of AWS. Results: Results indicated that having 
     high (vs. low) trait social anxiety was associated with a tendency to 
     experience high NA, low PA, and high self-reported stuttering 
     severity among AWS. A range of situational factors significantly 
     influenced the within-person variation of NA, PA, and self-reported 
     stuttering severity in everyday life. In addition, interacting with 
     distant social partners relative to being alone heightened NA, and 
     the effect was more prominent among AWS with high (vs. low) trait 
     social anxiety. Conclusions: Overall, the findings suggest that the 
     variation of affects and stuttering severity among AWS can be partly 
     accounted for by factors from both the situational and personal 
     levels. Clinicians should be aware of the low PA experienced by AWS 
     who have high (vs low) trait social anxiety in everyday life.]

     AB: A clinical, evidence-based model to inform clients and their 
     parents about the nature of stuttering is indispensable for the 
     field. In this paper, we propose the Erasmus Clinical Model of 
     Stuttering 2.0 for children who stutter and their parents, and adult 
     clients. It provides an up-to-date, clinical model summary of current 
     insights into the genetic, neurological, motoric, linguistic, 
     sensory, temperamental, psychological and social factors (be it 
     causal, eliciting, or maintaining) related to stuttering. First a 
     review is presented of current insights in these factors, and of six 
     scientific theories or models that have inspired the development of 
     our current clinical model. Following this, we will propose the 
     model, which has proven to be useful in clinical practice. The 
     proposed Erasmus Clinical Model of Stuttering visualizes the onset 
     and course of stuttering, and includes scales for stuttering severity 
     and impact, to be completed by the (parent of) the person who 
     stutters. The pathway of the model towards stuttering onset is based 
     on predisposing and mediating factors. In most children with an onset 
     of stuttering, stuttering is transient, but if stuttering continues, 
     its severity and impact vary widely. The model includes the circle of 
     Engel (1977), which visualizes unique interactions of relevant 
     biological, psychological, and social factors that determine the 
     speaker's experience of stuttering severity and its impact. 
     Discussing these factors and their interaction with an individual 
     client can feed into therapeutic targets. The model is supplemented 
     by a lifeline casus.]

     AB: Background: For children older than 6 years who stutter, there is 
     a gap in clinical research. This is an issue for speech-language 
     pathologists because the tractability of stuttering decreases and the 
     risk of long-term psychological consequences increase with age. 
     Purpose: To report a Phase II trial of a telehealth version of the 
     Lidcombe Program with school-age children. Methods: Participants were 
     37 children who stuttered, 6-12 years of age, from Australia, New 
     Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Parents were trained by video 
     telehealth how to deliver the Lidcombe Program to their child. 
     Primary and secondary outcomes were stuttering severity and 
     psychosocial functioning measured pre-treatment and at 6 months and 
     12 months after starting treatment. Parents submitted two 10-minute 
     recordings of their child speaking in conversation, and three 
     measures of anxiety, impact of stuttering, and communication 
     attitude. Results: Six months after starting treatment, seven 
     children (18.9%) attained Lidcombe Program Stage 2 criteria, 25 
     children (67.6%) showed a partial response to treatment, and five 
     children (13.5%) showed no response. By 12 months, 12 children 
     (32.4%) had reached Stage 2 criteria. Psychosocial improvements were 
     observed 6 and 12 months after starting treatment. Conclusions: The 
     Lidcombe Program may eliminate or nearly eliminate stuttering for 
     about one third of children 6-12 years of age. Randomized controlled 
     trials with this age group involving the Lidcombe Program are 
     warranted. In the interim, the Lidcombe Program is a clinical option 
     clinicians can implement with this age group to reduce stuttering and 
     its psychosocial impacts.]

     AB: Background: The Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of 
     Stuttering for Adults (OASES-A; Yaruss & Quesal, 2016) is a widely 
     used measurement tool designed to evaluate the adverse impact 
     associated with stuttering. Items examine general perceptions of 
     stuttering, personal reactions to stuttering, functional 
     communication difficulties, and consequences for quality of life. 
     This paper presents a shortened research version of the OASES-A 
     response form (OASES-A-R) that can be used by researchers in 
     scientific studies involving adults who stutter that reflect the 
     Section and Total Scores of the original OASES-A using fewer items. 
     Method: Previously collected OASES-A data (N = 315) were analyzed via 
     graded response modeling to identify discrimination values of each 
     OASES-A item in measuring each OASES-A Section Total Score. Items 
     with the highest discrimination and items judged by expert clinicians 
     to be more important in measuring adverse impact (N = 27) were used 
     to create a shortened OASES-A-R. The shortened OASES-A-R response 
     form was then validated and compared to the full OASES-A response 
     form in an independent sample (N = 156). Results: The shortened 
     25-item OASES-A-R response form demonstrated very high and positive 
     correlations with the full OASES-A response form. Similarly, each 
     OASES-A-R Section demonstrated high internal reliability coefficients 
     similar to those of the OASES-A. Discussion: The resulting 25-item 
     OASES-A-R response form provides a reflection of the speaker's 
     experience of stuttering as measured by the original 100-item OASES-A 
     that is suitable for use in certain research studies of adults who 
     stutter. Clinical use is not recommended, as the full OASES-A 
     provides additional insights about a client's experience of 
     stuttering that are necessary for effective treatment planning and 
     intervention.]

     AB: Substantial research on complete Achilles tendon ruptures is 
     available, but guidance on partial ruptures is comparatively sparse. 
     Conservative management is considered acceptable in partial tendon 
     ruptures affecting less than 50% of the tendon's width, but 
     supporting experimental evidence is currently lacking. Using a 
     previously validated finite element model of the Achilles tendon, 
     this study aimed to assess whether loading conditions simulating an 
     early functional rehabilitation protocol could elicit progression to 
     a complete rupture in partial ruptures of varying severity. In silico 
     tendon rupture simulations were performed to locate the most likely 
     rupture site for least, moderate, and extreme subtendon twist 
     configurations. These three models were split at the corresponding 
     rupture site and two sets of partial ruptures were created for each, 
     starting from the medial and lateral sides, and ranging from 10% to 
     50% loss of continuity. Simulations were conducted with material 
     parameters from healthy and tendinopathic tendons. Partial ruptures 
     were considered to progress if the volume of elements showing a 
     maximum principal strain above 10% exceeded 3 mm3. To assess whether 
     the tendinopathic tendons typical geometric characteristics could 
     compensate for the inferior material properties found in 
     tendinopathy, an additional model with increased cross-sectional area 
     in the free tendon region was developed. Progression to complete 
     ruptures occurred even with less than a 50% loss of continuity, 
     regardless of subtendon twisting, and material parameters. The 
     tendinopathic tendon model with increased cross-sectional area showed 
     similar results. These findings suggest the current criteria for 
     surgical treatment of partial ruptures should be reconsidered. 
     Statement of clinical significance: The clinical significance and 
     most appropriate treatment of partial ruptures of the Achilles tendon 
     is unclear. Despite the widespread use of the "50% rule" in treatment 
     decisions of partial tendon ruptures, experimental evidence 
     supporting it is missing. The present study provides new data, from a 
     validated aponeurotic and free Achilles tendon finite element model, 
     showing that partial ruptures may progress to complete ruptures under 
     loading conditions elicited from functional rehabilitation protocols, 
     even for partial ruptures affecting less than 50% of the tendon's 
     width. Under these novel findings, the current criteria for surgical 
     treatment of partial ruptures should be reconsidered.]

     AB: In carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA) of the thumb, to what 
     extent treatments should be directed by radiographic disease severity 
     versus pain-based indicators remains an open question. To address 
     this gap, this study investigated the relative impact of disease 
     severity and pain severity on the range of motion in participants 
     with CMC OA. We hypothesized larger differences would exist between 
     extremes in the pain severity cohort than the disease severity 
     cohort, suggesting pain modulates movement to a greater extent than 
     joint degradation. Thirty-one female participants (64.6 ± 10.9 
     years) were grouped as symptomatic or asymptomatic (pain severity 
     cohort) and early stage OA or end-stage OA (disease severity cohort) 
     using radiographs and questionnaires. Kinematics were measured during 
     single-planar and multiplanar range of motion tasks. Joint angle 
     differences between groups were statistically compared. Differences 
     in self-reported pain, function, and disability were evident in both 
     participant cohorts. Notably, substantial distinctions emerged 
     exclusively during multiplanar tasks, with a greater prevalence in 
     the disease severity cohort compared to the pain severity cohort. 
     Participants with end-stage OA also exhibited similar overall area 
     covered during circumduction in comparison to those with early-stage 
     OA, despite having a decreased range of motion at the CMC joint. The 
     study underscores the importance of assessing multiplanar tasks, 
     potentially leading to earlier identification of CMC OA. While 
     movement compensations such as employing the distal thumb joints over 
     the CMC joint were observed, delving deeper into the interplay 
     between pain and movement could yield greater insight into the 
     underlying factors steering these compensatory mechanisms.]

     AB: The need for additional fibular osteotomy (FO) when performing 
     supramalleolar osteotomy (SMO) in the varus ankle arthritis (VAA) is 
     controversial. Some cadaveric studies have been performed to prove 
     this; however, it is difficult to implement deformities including 
     talar tilting and translation in cadavers. In this study, we created 
     a model of VAA with the tilting and translation using 
     three-dimensional (3-D) finite element (FE) analysis and analyzed the 
     results of SMO with or without FO depending on the types of VAA. The 
     validated normal foot and ankle 3-D FE model was constructed 
     including the ankle cartilages of the talar dome and tibia plafond. 
     The VAA models were determined and reconstructed by following the 
     classification of VAA, VAA with medial translation for stage 3a, VAA 
     with varus tilting (7.5°) for stage 3b. The postoperative SMO models 
     (SMO with and without FO) were reconstructed by corresponding to each 
     VAA models. The FE analysis conditions were commonly applied. The 
     boundary condition of ankle joint was defined as "sliding condition" 
     and applied 0.002 friction coefficient to realize lubricative 
     property. Loading condition was assumed as a two-leg standing 
     position and half of the subject body weight (325 N) was loaded on 
     center of ground to vertical direction. Contact pressure changes were 
     predicted at the medial ankle cartilage. As a result, in VAA with 
     medial translation, isolated SMO may provide sufficient pressure 
     reduction at the medial ankle joint. However, in VAA with varus 
     tilting, SMO combined with FO could appropriately relieve 
     concentrated pressure at the medial ankle joint.]

     on inflammatory marker levels in women with overweight and obesity by 
     using network meta-analysis. Design: Systematic review with network 
     meta-analysis and Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development, 
     and Evaluation of the evidence. Methods: Literature as of April 2023 
     was searched from databases such as Cochrane, Embase, Pubmed, Web of 
     Science, and EBSCO, and English-language randomized controlled trials 
     that meet the inclusion criteria were selected. A random-effects 
     network meta-analysis was performed within a frequentist framework. 
     Results: A total of 75 articles and 4048 participants were included. 
     Resistance training was the most recommended type of exercise to 
     decrease C-reactive protein levels (surface under cumulative ranking 
     = 90.1; standardized mean difference = − 0.79, 95 % confidence 
     interval: − 1.17, − 0.42); aerobic exercise was the most 
     effective exercise type to reduce tumor necrosis factor-α levels 
     (surface under cumulative ranking = 87.9; standardized mean 
     difference = − 0.79, 95 % confidence interval: − 1.19, − 0.39); 
     combined aerobic and resistance exercise was the most effective type 
     of exercise to reduce interleukin-6 levels (surface under cumulative 
     ranking = 75.8; standardized mean difference = − 0.77, 95 % 
     confidence interval: − 1.38, − 0.16) and leptin levels (surface 
     under cumulative ranking = 77.1; standardized mean difference = − 
     0.96, 95 % confidence interval: − 1.72, − 0.20), and 
     high-intensity interval training was the type of exercise that was 
     well suited to increase adiponectin levels (surface under cumulative 
     ranking = 87.2; standardized mean difference = 0.99, 95 % confidence 
     interval: 0.27, 1.71). Conclusions: This network meta-analysis based 
     on randomized controlled trials confirmed that different exercise 
     types have different efficacies on inflammation indicators among 
     women with overweight and obesity. The findings may provide 
     clinicians and healthcare professionals with insights into the 
     implementation of exercise programs for women struggling with

     AB: Aim: Chronic wounds, defined as wounds that do not heal in a 
     logical set of stages, impact patients' quality of life by disrupting 
     their self-esteem, sleep, social interaction, work capacity, and 
     psychological well-being. Chronic wounds are a prevalent problem in 
     Oman due to the high number of patients with diabetes, sickle cell 
     disease, road traffic accidents, and decubitus ulcer. Therefore, it 
     is paramount to analyse the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of 
     these patients with chronic wounds. Material and methods: An 
     observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study with a quantitative 
     approach was conducted among 275 adult patients with chronic wounds 
     in three tertiary hospitals of Muscat from June to December 2021 
     using a self-reported Cardiff life wound impact questionnaire and the 
     Bates-Jensen wound assessment tool. Data were analysed with IBM SPSS 
     version 23 using inferential statistics and chi-square test. Results: 
     We found that the majority of participants were men (178; 64.7 %), 
     aged between 41 and 60 years (107; 38.9 %), predominantly with 
     diabetic wounds (80; 29.1 %). Respondents reported poor HRQOL across 
     all domains: well-being (63.24 ± 18.092), physical (53.24 ± 
     18.387), and social (59.54 ± 19.025). Statistically significant 
     poorer HRQOL was observed among the elderly above 60 years, 
     illiterates, those with traumatic wounds, and those receiving 
     medication and dressing as treatment. Conclusions: Our findings 
     indicate that Omani patients with chronic wounds experience low 
     HRQOL. It is imperative for healthcare providers to offer 
     comprehensive care to these patients. To enhance their quality of 
     life and alleviate suffering, evaluating both the wounds and HRQOL is 
     essential. Such assessments will enable the optimisation of treatment 
     and coping strategies for patients.]

     The new tool Foot and Ankle Flexibility Index (FAFI) was predicated 
     upon the last 7 items of LLAS, which are specific to the foot and 
     ankle. The internal consistency was measured with Cronbach's test. 
     Kappa statistics with 95% CI were calculated to verify the level of 
     inter-rater and intra-rater agreement for the FAFI. Results: 
     Cronbach's alpha returned 0.82. The correlations between items 
     returned a mean of 0.59 (range: 0.43-0.74). The discrimination score 
     on the ROC curve (4 points) showed that the model can be used to 
     identify children with joint hypermobility of the foot and ankle. 
     Inter-rater reliability was largely good (ICC = 0.89). Excellent 
     intra-rater reliability was found (ICC = 0.96). Conclusions: This 
     study identified high reliability between evaluators, and high 
     sensitivity and specificity, for a new reliable and valid tool for 
     the identification of foot and ankle joint hypermobility.]

     pediatric population. Methods: A prospective cohort study with thirty 
     children (24 males and 6 females; mean age 8.8 ± 2.2) with a 
     diagnosis of vocal fold nodule (VFN) was conducted. All participants 
     were included in an 8-week voice therapy program consisting of vocal 
     hygiene education and parental rule-setting. Videolaryngoscopic 
     examination, auditory-perceptual evaluation, and acoustic voice 
     analysis were performed immediately before and after the 
     intervention. Results: The comparison of videolaryngoscopic findings 
     before and after the therapy revealed that the size of the nodules 
     decreased significantly (P < 0.001). Findings from the laryngeal 
     examination showed that the vast majority of children 73.3% (n = 22) 
     had no VFN anymore after the intervention. The auditory-perceptual 
     evaluation showed that overall severity of dysphonia decreased 
     significantly [from 50 (40-70) to 38 (30-45), P < 0.001]. Jitter 
     local (P = 0.031) and Jitter local abs (P = 0.043) parameters 
     statistically differed after the therapy. There were not any 
     statistically significant differences for mean F0, shimmer local (%), 
     shimmer local (dB), and mean HNR. Conclusions: The voice therapy 
     method in this study has a clear benefit on the voice of children 
     with VFN and can be used in clinical practice. Specifically, 
     clinicians should consider the parents as a core component of voice 
     therapies and pay attention to vocal hygiene education for optimal 
     management of VFN related childhood dysphonia.]

     Methods: A total of 19 females were included in this study, ranging

     resistance (LAR), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum

     to a mean of 78.53) and MEP (Mean of 90.00 to a mean of 112.16) 
     showed significant increase post-treatment. In addition, LAR (Mean of 
     73.30 to a mean of 60.67) and CSI (Mean of 19.37 to a mean of 15.00) 
     significantly decreased post-treatment. General changes in pre- and

     follow-up questionnaire indicated that the majority of patients felt 
     their cough was better after 4 weeks. Conclusions: Muscle strength 
     training provides a tool to aid in the control of cough for patients 
     who are refractory to medical and other behavioral treatments. 
     Improvement in cough may be associated with a reduction in subglottic 
     pressure and increased air flow resulting in lower laryngeal airway

     AB: Introduction: Chronic cough is a persistent cough lasting greater 
     than eight weeks. The prevalence rate is estimated to be 9% to 33% in 
     the United States. There are several treatment modalities described 
     in current literature including medical, surgical, and behavioral 
     interventions. Behavioral intervention with a speech-language 
     pathologist (SLP) includes education on laryngeal hygiene and the 
     voluntary control of cough as well as respiratory retraining to 
     suppress or reduce the duration of cough. Cough suppression therapy, 
     like other behavioral therapies, requires patient motivation and 
     commitment to participation and completion in therapy. Methods: This 
     study was a prospective cross-sectional survey at a single academic 
     institution. Adult patients evaluated by a laryngologist for chronic 
     cough regardless of their primary etiology were included. Patients 
     who were tracheostomy dependent, on oxygen therapy, had vocal fold 
     paralysis/immobility, or had undergone previous laryngeal surgery 
     were excluded. Patients were surveyed at the end of the initial 
     clinic visit or at the beginning of the first cough suppression 
     therapy session. Subjects reported their motivational factors for 
     undergoing cough suppression therapy. Results: The majority of 
     patients, 21 (58.33%), identified as female, 15 patients (41.20%) 
     identified as male, and no patients identified as transgender, 
     nonbinary, and/or other gender. The patients in this study had a mean 
     age of 57.75 (12.12) years. 35 patients (97.22%) were interested in 
     cough suppression therapy. The mean presenting cough severity index 
     (CSI) was 19.39 (10.28) with the mean cough duration of 8.69 (12.10) 
     years. Conclusions: Patients primarily sought cough suppression 
     therapy due to intrinsic factors rather than extrinsic influence. By 
     understanding the relationship between symptomatology and patient 
     motivation, clinicians can better counsel their patients and improve 
     methods to assess candidacy for behavioral treatment.]

     AB: Objectives: The aim was to compare voice outcomes over time in 
     patients treated with Imitation Model voice therapy and Verbal 
     Instructions Model voice therapy. Methods: A prospective clinical 
     trial was performed with 56 consecutive patients diagnosed with a 
     primary or secondary functional voice disorder. Thirty-one patients 
     were included for voice therapy following the Imitation Model and 25 
     patients for the Verbal Instructions Model. Assessments included a 
     self-rated Voice Handicap Index, self-perceived hoarseness and vocal 
     fatigue, perceptual voice evaluation by a Speech Language 
     Pathologist, and maximum Voice Range Profiles. All assessments were 
     completed before therapy, at end of therapy, at six-months 
     posttherapy follow-up and 12-months posttherapy follow-up. For 
     maximum Voice Range Profiles group differences were also compared for 
     effects from end-of-treatment to follow-up assessments. Linear mixed 
     models were used for analysis. Results: Comparison between treatment 
     groups showed significantly larger long-term improvement from the 
     baseline, for verbal instructions model as compared to imitation 
     model for Voice Handicap Index total, and also the physical and 
     emotional subscales, while there was no difference between groups for 
     the functional subscale. Also, voice quality improved more after 
     verbal instructions model, as compared to imitation model, at end of 
     therapy. Results from self-rated hoarseness and vocal fatigue showed 
     no difference between groups. There was no difference between 
     treatment groups in the change of maximum Voice Range Profile from 
     end-of-treatment to follow-up assessments. Conclusions: The study 
     showed that both Imitation Model voice therapy and Verbal 
     Instructions Model voice therapy improved voice function. Compared to 
     Imitation Model, the Verbal Instructions model showed larger 
     long-term effect on physical and emotional aspects of voice function 
     in everyday life. The two approaches for voice therapy might have 
     different impacts on patients' learning.]

     AB: Objectives: Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is a form of 
     velopharyngeal dysfunction caused by abnormal or insufficient 
     anatomy. This process is known to be associated with dysphagia and 
     dysphonia but surgical interventions for these complex patients have 
     not been well studied. The current study characterized a small cohort 
     of adult patients with acquired VPI, dysphonia, and dysphagia, as 
     well as associated surgical interventions. Methods: A retrospective 
     descriptive case series of 22 (N = 22) adult patients over a 6-year 
     period with acquired VPI and varying degrees of dysphagia and 
     dysphonia was described from a multi-disciplinary voice and 
     swallowing clinic. Perceptual assessment, nasopharyngoscopy, 
     fluoroscopic swallowing assessment, and patient reported outcomes 
     were reviewed to characterize the cohort. Results: VPI etiologies 
     included: stroke (n = 4), head and neck cancer (n = 5), brainstem 
     lesions (n = 5), trauma (n = 5), and other/unknown (n = 3). All 22 
     patients underwent nasopharyngoscopy and were categorized as having 
     unilateral (n = 13), central (n = 4), or no (n = 5) velopharyngeal 
     deficits. Seventeen patients (77.2%) underwent modified barium 
     swallow studies, revealing that soft palate elevation scored least 
     impaired among patients with no VPI, and most impaired among patients 
     with unilateral VPI deficits. All 22 patients underwent some form of 
     surgical intervention for VPI, with 14 (63.6%) of those patients 
     requiring additional surgical revision. Conclusion: This series is 
     one of the first to the authors' knowledge to characterize a cohort 
     of individuals with VPI, dysphagia, and dysphonia and associated 
     surgical interventions.]

     AB: Objectives/Hypothesis: Essential vocal tremor (EVT) is an 
     uncommon but challenging condition to manage. Several medical and 
     interventional treatment options have been reported but efficacy 
     remains unclear. We performed a scoping review of high-quality 
     clinical trials to identify effective evidence-based treatments for 
     EVT. Study. Design: Scoping review.. Methods: Relevant studies were 
     identified using the databases MedLine, Cochrane Central Register of 
     Controlled Trials, and Embase. Subjective and objective outcomes for 
     each modality were analyzed and the effect sizes were quantified 
     using Hedges' g measure to allow comparison between studies. Results: 
     We identified 421 studies eligible for screening with 11 included in 
     the final analysis. Evidence supporting effective EVT treatments was 
     found for bilateral versus unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) 
     (Hedges' g 0.65, 95% CI = 0.10-1.20) and octanoic acid (Hedges' g 
     1.15, 95% CI = 0.40-1.90). Evidence to support the use of 
     methazolamide was not sufficient (Hedges' g 0.51, 95% CI = -0.64 to 
     1.66). Botulinum toxin (BT) injections were equivalent when comparing 
     unilateral versus bilateral (Hedges' g -0.18, 95% CI = -1.06 to 
     0.70); BT did not display any advantage over propranolol (Hedges' g 
     -0.47, 95% CI = -1.73 to 0.78) or injection augmentation (Hedges' g 
     0.068, 95% CI = -0.98 to 1.12). Conclusions: Our review finds very 
     little high-quality evidence supporting any treatment for EVT. 
     Octanoic acid reduced fluctuations in EVT but did not affect the 
     perception of the tremor. In refractory cases, bilateral DBS was 
     superior to unilateral DBS in improving subjective voice outcomes. 
     Unilateral and bilateral BT injections were equivalent, and BT 
     injection was not more effective than injection augmentation. Further 
     direct comparison in well-designed prospective studies may help 
     clarify optimal treatment for EVT patients.]

     after laryngeal microsurgery (LMS) in patients with benign vocal fold 
     (VF) mucosal disease and in patients with overt reflux symptom 
     according to subjective and objective voice assessment. Methods: The 
     improvement of voice handicap index-10 (VHI-10) score, reflux symptom 
     index (RSI) score, grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and 
     strain (GRBAS) score, Jitter, Shimmer, noise to harmonics ratio 
     (NHR), maximum phonation time of acoustic voice analysis. Results: A 
     total of 47 patients (PPI group [n = 24] and non-PPI group [n = 23]) 
     completed the study. The scores for VHI-10, RSI, GRBAS, and acoustic 
     parameters significantly improved in both groups after surgery. In 
     the subgroup analysis of patients with overt reflux symptoms (RSI ≥ 
     13; non-PPI group [n = 12], PPI group [n = 15]), significant 
     between-group differences were observed in terms of the improvement 
     in NHR and the strain factor. Conclusion: Postoperative PPI 
     administration in patients with VF benign mucosal disease with reflux 
     symptoms might improve subjective and objective voice outcomes after 
     LMS.]

     AB: Objective: Vocal fold paresis or paralysis (VFP) may severely 
     affect quality of life due to dysphonia and respiratory distress. As 
     an increasing percentage of the United States population receives the 
     COVID-19 vaccination, the objective of this study is to determine the 
     correlation of COVID-19 postvaccination recurrent laryngeal 
     neuropathy and resulting VFP. Methods: The Vaccine Adverse Event 
     Reporting System database was queried for patients exhibiting 
     symptoms of VFP following COVID-19 vaccination. Patient demographics 
     and clinical information including presenting symptoms, time of 
     symptom onset, time of diagnosis and laterality. Results: Twenty 
     patients were found to have laryngoscopy confirmed VFP following 
     COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccinations for Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and 
     Janssen were reported. Of those reported, 13 patients were female 
     (65.0%) and seven were male (35.0%), with a mean age of 61.8 years. 
     The most common presenting symptom was a hoarse voice (30.0%). A 
     majority of these cases were unilateral in nature (64.0%). Mean time 
     from vaccination to symptom onset was 12.1 days and mean time from 
     vaccination to diagnosis was 37.6 days. Conclusion: For patients 
     presenting with voice or swallowing complaints after receiving the 
     COVID-19 vaccine, prompt evaluation by an otolaryngologist should 
     occur. However, the potential VFP side effect of vaccination is very 
     rarely cited in the literature and largely outweighed by the benefits 
     of vaccination. Further research is needed to delineate the exact 
     pathophysiology of this complication and determine whether a causal 
     relationship exists.]

     AB: Objective: Exposure to chlorine gas can cause many problems for 
     people who work in chlorine chemical production factories. The 
     present study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of 
     laryngeal and voice symptoms and related factors among workers in a 
     chlorine chemical production factory. Design: A case-control 
     study.Patients and. Methods: A total number of 208 workers, including 
     138 workers (13 females, 125 males) who work in a chlorine chemical 
     production factory and 70 (three females, 67 males) workers of a 
     non-chlorine producing factory (producing metal materials), 
     participated in the study. All participants completed self-reported 
     questionnaires to investigate laryngeal or voice problems. These 
     questionnaires investigated workplace vocal health, presence of voice 
     or laryngeal problems, voice symptoms and laryngeal discomforts, and 
     complications of voice problems. Results: The prevalence of laryngeal 
     or voice problems in the workers of the chlorine factory group 
     (18.8%) was higher than in the control group (7%) and this difference 
     was statistically significant (P = 0.018). For all of the voice and 
     laryngeal symptoms, workers in the chlorine factory had more symptoms 
     than workers in the control group. Results of a Chi-Square test 
     showed that workers in the chlorine factory had more significant 
     vocal fatigue and dry throat symptoms than the control group (P < 
     0.05). Regression logistic analyses showed that age (P = 0.008; OR = 
     1.09; CI = 1.02-1.17), inadequate humidity (P = 0.015; OR = 2.78; CI 
     = 1.21-6.38), and unavailability of water (P = 0.021; OR = 3.80; CI = 
     1.22-11.76) raised the chances of increasing the laryngeal and voice 
     symptoms among workers. The most common side effects of laryngeal 
     symptoms and voice problems for workers were: difficulty speaking in 
     crowded environments, low self-esteem while talking, need for 
     repetition to understand speech, and anxiety when speaking. 
     Conclusion: Laryngeal and voice problems were more prevalent in the 
     chlorine factory workers group than in the control group. The factors 
     of age, inadequate humidity, and unavailability of water increased 
     the probability for laryngeal or voice symptoms among chlorine 
     factory workers. These findings indicate the need for further 
     research with this population.]

     Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of adult patients 
     undergoing treatment for RRP at a tertiary-care academic center (TAC, 
     n = 48) versus public safety net hospital (PSNH, n = 14), both 
     staffed by the same Otolaryngology providers. Results: There was no 
     difference between cohorts in age, gender, medical comorbidities, 
     history of juvenile-onset presentation, or history of prior treatment 
     at a different institution. PSNH patients were more likely to be 
     Hispanic/Latino, primarily speak Spanish, have public or no 
     insurance, and reside in a zip code with lower median income compared 
     with TAC patients. Despite living significantly closer to the 
     hospital, PSNH patients were more likely than TAC patients to present 
     with respiratory symptoms (50% versus 20.8%, P = 0.04), and exhibit 
     more than one involved laryngeal subsite at their first surgical 
     intervention (78.6% versus 27.1%, P = 0.001). They also had high 
     rates of referral for otolaryngologic care via the emergency 
     department (42.9%) rather than outpatient specialty referral (35.7%) 
     and were more likely than TAC patients to require urgent intervention 
     (21.4% versus 2.1%, P = 0.03). There was no difference in time 
     interval from first clinic visit to procedure date or total number of 
     treatments. Conclusions: PSNH patients present with more severe and 
     symptomatic RRP disease compared with TAC patients. This finding may 
     be related to sociodemographic disparities leading to poorer access 
     in care.]

     MD: AB]
     AB: Objective: Adductor spasmodic dysphonia (AdSD) is a neurogenic 
     voice disorder, affecting the intrinsic laryngeal muscle control. 
     AdSD leads to involuntary laryngeal spasms and only reveals during 
     connected speech. Laryngeal high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) coupled 
     with a flexible fiberoptic endoscope provides a unique opportunity to 
     study voice production and visualize the vocal fold vibrations in 
     AdSD during speech. The goal of this study is to automatically detect 
     instances during which the image of the vocal folds is optically 
     obstructed in HSV recordings obtained during connected speech. 
     Methods: HSV data were recorded from vocally normal adults and 
     patients with AdSD during reading of the "Rainbow Passage", six 
     CAPE-V sentences, and production of the vowel /i/. A convolutional 
     neural network was developed and trained as a classifier to detect 
     obstructed/unobstructed vocal folds in HSV frames. Manually labelled 
     data were used for training, validating, and testing of the network. 
     Moreover, a comprehensive robustness evaluation was conducted to 
     compare the performance of the developed classifier and visual 
     analysis of HSV data. Results: The developed convolutional neural 
     network was able to automatically detect the vocal fold obstructions 
     in HSV data in vocally normal participants and AdSD patients. The 
     trained network was tested successfully and showed an overall 
     classification accuracy of 94.18% on the testing dataset. The 
     robustness evaluation showed an average overall accuracy of 94.81% on 
     a massive number of HSV frames demonstrating the high robustness of 
     the introduced technique while keeping a high level of accuracy. 
     Conclusions: The proposed approach can be used for efficient analysis 
     of HSV data to study laryngeal maneuvers in patients with AdSD during 
     connected speech. Additionally, this method will facilitate 
     development of vocal fold vibratory measures for HSV frames with an 
     unobstructed view of the vocal folds. Indicating parts of connected 
     speech that provide an unobstructed view of the vocal folds can be 
     used for developing optimal passages for precise HSV examination 
     during connected speech and subject-specific clinical voice 
     assessment protocols.]

     condition. This information can be used to diagnose the disease. This 
     article analyzes the CASs of newborns under two months old using 
     machine learning approaches to develop an automatic diagnostic system 
     for identifying septic infants from healthy ones. Septic infants have 
     not been studied in this context. Methodology: The proposed features 
     include Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and the prosodic features 
     of tilt, rhythm, and intensity. The performance of each feature set 
     was evaluated using a collection of classifiers, including Support 
     Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree, and discriminant analysis. We 
     also examined the majority voting method for improving the 
     classification results and feature manipulation and multiple 
     classifier framework, which has not previously been reported in the 
     literature on developing an automatic diagnostic system based on the 
     infant's CAS. We tested our methodology on two datasets of expiration 
     and inspiration episodes of newborns' CASs. Results and. Conclusion: 
     The framework of the concatenation of all feature sets using 
     quadratic SVM resulted in the best F-score with 86% for the 
     expiration dataset. Furthermore, the framework of tilt feature set 
     with quadratic discriminant with 83.90% resulted in the best F-score 
     for inspiration. We found out that septic infants cry differently 
     than healthy infants through these experiments. Thus, our proposed 
     method can be used as a noninvasive tool for identifying septic 
     infants from healthy ones only based on their CAS.]

     Speech Lab, Praat, and TF32. Materials and. Methods: Sustained vowel 
     phonations for the quantal vowels /ɑ/, /i/, and /u/ were analyzed 
     for 80 speakers with organic dysphonia and 60 age- and sex-matched 
     healthy controls. Descriptive, inferential, and correlation data are 
     reported for mean fundamental frequency (mean F0), standard deviation 
     of fundamental frequency (SD F0), short-term perturbation measures of 
     jitter and shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR). Results: The 
     present study replicated previous findings of interprogram 
     differences for healthy speakers, with MDVP consistently yielding 
     higher values than Praat and TF32 for SD F0, jitter, and shimmer and 
     lower values for HNR. Similar, but magnified patterns of results were 
     observed for speakers with dysphonia. Conclusion: The variation 
     observed across programs calls into question the validity in 
     comparing voice outcomes reported by one AASP to those previously 
     obtained by another, particularly for acoustic signals with aperiodic 
     components that are commonly present in disordered voices. It is 
     advised that waveforms be visually inspected prior to conducting 
     acoustic analysis, and that voice outcomes not be combined or 
     compared across AASPs.]

     measures of vocal structure and function in females with benign vocal 
     fold lesions (BVFLs) and determine if change is observed in voice and 
     lesion characteristics. Study. Design: Prospective cohort study. 
     Methods: Twenty-eight (n = 28) female subjects with phonotraumatic 
     BVFLs completed a vocal loading task of 30 minutes of reading aloud 
     at 75-85 dBA. Multidimensional voice evaluation was completed pre- 
     and post-load, including audio and videostroboscopy recordings and 
     images for expert perceptual ratings and acoustic and aerodynamic 
     evaluation. Subjects also scored themselves using a 10 cm visual 
     analogue scale for Perceived Phonatory Effort, and completed the 
     Evaluation of Ability to Voice Easily, a 12 item self-report scale of 
     current perceived speaking voice function. An exploratory rather than 
     confirmatory approach to data analysis was adopted. The direction and 
     magnitude of the change scores (pre- to post-load) for each 
     individual, across a wide variety of instrumental and self-report 
     measures, were assessed against a Minimal Clinically Important 
     Difference criteria. Results: Observations of change and the 
     direction of change in vocal response of individuals with BVFLs to 30 
     minutes of loud vocal load was variable. Minimal to no change was 
     noted for participants pre- to post-load as rated perceptually, for 
     auditory and videostroboscopy samples. For most instrumental 
     measures, change was shown for many participants including an overall 
     improvement in aerodynamic and acoustic measures of function and 
     efficiency post-load for 20 participants (77%) and decline in 
     function for 4 participants (15%). Self-reported effort and vocal 
     function post-load was multidirectional with similar numbers of 
     participants reporting no change, improved function or a decline. 
     Conclusion: Subjects with BVFLs demonstrate change in vocal function 
     following 30 minutes of vocal load. While this change can be variable 
     and multidirectional, overall improvement was observed in 
     instrumental measures of function and efficiency for most 
     participants. Some participants perceived this change to be an 
     increase in effort, some a reduction in effort and some perceived no 
     change. Improved vocal function despite relative lesion stability can 
     seemingly occur after loading in some pathological voices.]

     using a portable voice accumulator (PVA) to study carry-over of 
     treatment effects on speech and voice in people with mild-moderate 
     Parkinson's disease. Methods: The study was guided by the checklist 
     in Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 
     statement: extension to randomized pilot and feasibility trials. 
     Participants with Parkinson's disease were recruited within the 
     context of a randomized controlled trial with random allocation to 
     intervention with either HiCommunication, a program targeting speech 
     and communication, or HiBalance, a program targeting balance and 
     strength. Before and after intervention data was collected from 
     standardized studio recordings of speech and registrations of voice 
     use in daily life with the PVA VoxLog. Results: Fifteen participants 
     were included in the study and sufficient data was yielded from six 
     of them. Reasons for insufficient data included technical issues and 
     difficulties handling the PVA. Changes in voice sound level from pre 
     to post intervention differed at an individual level when assessed in 
     daily life compared to studio recordings. Registrations in daily life 
     provided information on phonation ratio and ability to adapt voice 
     sound level to environmental noise. Conclusion: This study highlights 
     the challenges of studying intervention effects on voice use in daily 
     life using a PVA. Improvements of test protocols in future studies 
     are suggested. We exemplify how PVA data may generate a more detailed 
     and ecologically valid picture of voice use complementing studio 
     recordings of speech. Finally, we encourage technical development of 
     more user-friendly PVAs.]

     AB: Introduction: This study empirically evaluated the influence of 
     phonatory break duration and pause time on auditory-perceptual 
     measures of speech produced by 26 adult speakers diagnosed with 
     adductor-type laryngeal dystonia (AdLD). Type of Study: Experimental. 
     Methods: Fifteen inexperienced, young adult normal-hearing listeners 
     provided ratings of speech acceptability and listener comfort for 
     samples of running speech. Four phonatory break and pause time 
     conditions were assessed using visual analog scaling methods. All 
     stimuli were randomized for presentation and listeners were presented 
     with experimental stimuli in a counterbalanced manner. Results: 
     Results indicate that the duration of phonatory breaks directly 
     influenced listener ratings of speech acceptability (P < 0.001) and 
     listener comfort (P < 0.001), with significant differences between 
     original and modified recordings for both. Speech acceptability and 
     listener comfort ratings were strongly correlated across all timing 
     conditions (r = 0.85-0.97). Conclusions: The duration of phonatory 
     breaks and pauses have significantly influence judgments of speech 
     acceptability and listener comfort for AdLD. This suggests that 
     temporal factors such as phonatory break duration and pause time in 
     AdLD may carry substantial negative impact on listeners' perception 
     relative to other auditory-perceptual features that co-exist in the 
     signal.]

     AB: Objective: This study explored the voice experience, singing 
     ability, and wellbeing of singers diagnosed with Hypermobility 
     Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome 
     (h-EDS). Study. Design: This was a mixed-method study. A purposive 
     sampling strategy was used. Data were collected via an online survey, 
     using written closed and open-ended questions. Methods: 276 adults 
     completed the survey. This study focuses on a subset of 
     professionally-trained singers (n=71). Responses elicited information 
     about participants' voice health and function, symptoms of 
     hypermobility, singing experiences and training. Data were analysed 
     using template analysis. Results: Many participants reported wide 
     vocal ranges and enjoyment of singing but 74.6% of participants 
     across all age groups (18-60 years) experienced voice difficulties. 
     Three common themes were identified: (1) 'My unreliable voice': The 
     ups and downs; (2) Wider effects of HSD/h-EDS on singers, and (3) 
     Need for acknowledgment and support. Conclusions: Voice difficulties 
     and hypermobility-related health conditions affected the 
     participants' abilities to sing and perform; this impacted their 
     professional and personal opportunities, communication, 
     relationships, and wellbeing. Our results indicate that symptoms of 
     voice disorder worsen over time. We suggest practical strategies that 
     singers and training providers could implement to support hypermobile 
     singers. More research is needed to fully understand voice 
     difficulties in singers with HSD/H-EDS and to inform tuition and 
     support.]

     AB: Objectives: To verify the possible function of Liuzijue Qigong 
     (LQG), a kind of traditional Chinese health exercise, in improving 
     phonation. Methods: A total of 30 healthy volunteers (10 males, 20 
     females) without voice disorders were included. The subjects were 
     asked to have phonation tasks at the sitting and LQG postures. 
     Aerodynamic, electroglottographic, and acoustic parameters were 
     measured. Expiratory Volume (FVC); Subglottic Pressure at comfortable 
     phonation (SGP), Glottal Resistance (GR), Glottal Efficiency (GE); 
     Contact Quotient (CQ), Mean Flow (MF), Fundamental frequency (F0), 
     Mean Sound Pressure Level (SPL); Phonation Threshold Pressure (PTP); 
     and Maximum Phonation Time (MPT) were measured and analyzed. Results: 
     In total subjects, the analysis showed a significant increase in FVC 
     (P = 0.020), SGP (P = 0.043), F0 (P = 0.021), and PTP (P = 0.000) at 
     the LQG posture when compared with the sitting posture, and there is 
     no difference in CQ, MF, SPL, GR, GE, and MPT. Conclusions: The 
     results showed LQG posture increased the respiratory support and 
     glottal closure, while induced the respiratory system and vocal 
     system in coordination to improve phonation. It is logical to 
     postulate that LQG has potential in the management of voice disorders 
     with glottal closure insufficiency.]

     AB: Objective: To verify whether the dimensions of different segments 
     of the oropharyngeal cavity have different proportions between 
     Parkinson's disease patients and vocally healthy subjects and 
     investigate whether the measurements of these subjects' oropharyngeal 
     geometry associate with their acoustic measurements of voice. Method: 
     Quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional, and retrospective study 
     with secondary data, approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee 
     under no. 4.325.029. We used vocal samples and data from the 
     oropharyngeal geometry of 40 subjects - 20 with Parkinson's disease 
     stages I to III and 20 who formed the control group, matched for sex 
     and age. Each group had 10 males and 10 females, mean age of 61 years 
     (±6.0). Formant (F1, F2, and F3) and cepstral measures of the 
     sustained vowel /ε/ were extracted and arranged in the database to 
     determine their values using Praat software. The data were 
     descriptively analyzed, with statistics generated with R software. 
     The proportion of oropharyngeal geometry measurements was arranged by 
     mean values and coefficients of variation. Pearson's linear 
     correlation test was applied to relate voice parameters to 
     oropharyngeal geometry, considering P < 0.05, and linear regression 
     test, to justify F2. Results: The Parkinson's disease group showed a 
     linear relationship between oral cavity length and F1 in males (P = 
     0.04) and between glottal area and F2 in females (P = 0.00); linear 
     relationships were established according to age in both groups, and a 
     regression model for F2 was estimated (R2 = 0.61). There was no 
     difference between pathological and healthy voices; there was a 
     difference in the proportional relationship of oropharyngeal geometry 
     between the groups. Conclusion: The proportional relationship of 
     oropharyngeal geometry differs between the Parkinson's disease group 
     and the control group, as well as the relationship between 
     oropharyngeal geometry and formant and cepstral values of voice 
     according to the subjects' sex and age.]

     questionnaire was developed and used to gather data on the knowledge, 
     attitude, and practices of Hindustani classical singers towards vocal 
     health care. An online survey link was generated, and responses were 
     collected from self-identified trained Hindustani classical singers. 
     Descriptive statistics was carried out for the closed-ended questions 
     and inductive approach was used to analyse the responses of 
     open-ended questions. Results: Ninety-four self-identified trained 
     Hindustani classical singers participated in the study. The responses 
     indicate good knowledge towards vocal health measures and positive 
     attitudes towards vocal health care. The open-ended responses were 
     analysed using an inductive approach. Although, 70% were aware about 
     role of a speech language pathologist, only 9.7% reported of 
     consulting one in the event of voice problem. Further, 70% singers 
     reported of following precautions to avoid voice problems while 85.1% 
     considered voice rest as necessary before a performance. The singers 
     reported of using home remedies, vocal and non-vocal measures as a 
     part of vocal health measures. Conclusions: The present study helps 
     to profile the knowledge, attitude, and practices towards vocal 
     health care amongst Hindustani classical singers. It also helps to 
     provide a basis for further studies to establish an empirical basis

     AB: Objective: Exercise remains a hallmark treatment for 
     post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) and may maintain joint 
     homeostasis in part by clearing inflammatory cytokines, cells, and 
     particles. It remains largely unknown whether exercise-induced joint 
     clearance can provide therapeutic relief of PTOA. In this study, we 
     hypothesized that exercise could slow the progression of preclinical 
     PTOA in part by enhancing knee joint clearance. Design: Surgical 
     medial meniscal transection was used to induce PTOA in 3-month-old 
     male Lewis rats. A sham surgery was used as a control. Mild treadmill 
     walking was introduced 3 weeks post-surgery and maintained to 6 weeks 
     post-surgery. Gait and isometric muscle torque were measured at the 
     study endpoint. Near-infrared imaging tracked how exercise altered 
     lymphatic and venous knee joint clearance during discrete time points 
     of PTOA progression. Results: Exercise mitigated joint degradation 
     associated with PTOA by preserving glycosaminoglycan content and 
     reducing osteophyte volume (effect size (95% Confidence Interval 
     (CI)); 1.74 (0.71-2.26)). PTOA increased hind step widths (0.57 
     (0.18-0.95) cm), but exercise corrected this gait dysfunction (0.54 
     (0.16-0.93) cm), potentially indicating pain relief. Venous, but not 
     lymphatic, clearance was quicker 1-, 3-, and 6-weeks post-surgery 
     compared to baseline. The mild treadmill walking protocol expedited 
     lymphatic clearance rate in moderate PTOA (3.39 (0.20-6.59) hrs), 
     suggesting exercise may play a critical role in restoring joint 
     homeostasis. Conclusions: We conclude that mild exercise has the 
     potential to slow disease progression in part by expediting joint 
     clearance in moderate PTOA.]

     AB: Objective: To compare the responsiveness of two unilateral 
     lower-limb performance-based tests, the one-leg rise test and the 
     maximal step-up test, with the bilateral 30-second chair-stand test 
     and the self-reported measure of physical function (HOOS/KOOS). 
     Specific aims were to evaluate responsiveness, floor/ceiling effect 
     and association between the instruments. Method: Data was included 
     from 111 participants, mean age 61.3 years (8.3), with clinically 
     verified hip or knee osteoarthritis, who reported less than 150 
     minutes/week of moderate or vigorous intensity physical activity. 
     Responsiveness, how well the instruments captured improvements, was 
     measured as Cohen's standardised mean difference for effect size, and 
     was assessed from baseline to 12 months following a physical activity 
     intervention. Other assessments were floor and ceiling effects, and 
     correlations between tests. Results: The maximal step-up test had an 
     effect size of 0.57 (95% CI 0.37, 0.77), the 30-second chair-stand 
     0.48 (95% CI 0.29, 0.68) and the one-leg rise test 0.12 (95% CI 0.60, 
     0.31). The one-leg rise test had a floor effect as 72% of the 
     participants scored zero at baseline and 63% at 12 months. The 
     correlation between performance-based tests and questionnaires was 
     considered to be minor (r = 0.188 to 0.226) (p = 0.018 to 0.048). 
     Conclusion: The unilateral maximal step-up test seems more responsive 
     to change in physical function compared to the bilateral 30-second 
     chair-stand test, although the tests did not differ statistically in 
     effect size. The maximal step-up test provides specific information 
     about each leg for the individual and allows for comparison between 
     the legs.]

     individualized follow-up highlight the importance of developing an 
     Internet-based follow-up platform to support caregivers of children 
     with Bronchiolitis Obliterans (BO). This Study aims to explore and 
     test the potential benefits of this platform by comparing family 
     management, medication compliance and clinical systems. Study design 
     and methods: A two-arm, single-blind randomized controlled trial was 
     conducted on 168 children with BO and their families from January 
     2022 to October 2022. Families were randomly divided into 
     Internet-based follow-up group and conventional follow-up group with 
     a ratio of 1:1. Scores of family management measures (FaMM), 8-item 
     of Morisky Medication Adherence (8-MMAS) and BO clinical symptoms of 
     both groups were collected at three points of time: the day of 
     discharge (T1), 3 months after discharge (T2), and 6 months after 
     discharge (T3). The changes of each group due to intervention were 
     compared by repeated-measures ANOVA. Results: 90 families completed 
     the trial, including 48 in the Internet-based follow-up group and 42 
     in the conventional follow-up group. The results showed a significant 
     difference in the group-by-time interaction on the scores of Child's 
     Daily Life, Condition Management Ability and Parental Mutuality (p < 
     0.05). No group-by-time effect was found on the scores of View of 
     Condition Impact and Family Life Difficulty. Scores of BO clinical 
     symptoms and MMAS-8 showed intra-group, inter-group, and 
     group-by-time effects. Conclusions: The Internet-based follow-up 
     platform can empower caregivers in enhancing effective family 
     management, improving medication compliance in children with BO, and 
     relieving patients' clinical symptoms.]

     AB: Injury surveillance data indicate that collegiate athletes are at 
     greater risk for lower extremity (LE) injuries following 
     sports-related concussion (SRC). While the association between SRC 
     and LE injury appears to be clinically relevant up to 1-year 
     post-SRC, little evidence has been provided to determine possible 
     mechanistic rationales. Thus, we aimed to compare collegiate athletes 
     with a history of SRC to matched controls on biomechanical and 
     cognitive performance measures associated with LE injury risk. 
     Athletes with a history of SRC (n = 20) and matched controls (n = 20) 
     performed unanticipated bilateral land-and-cut tasks and cognitive 
     assessments. Group-based analyses (ANOVA) and predictive modeling 
     (C5.0 decision tree algorithm) were used to compare group differences 
     on biomechanical and cognitive measures. Collegiate athletes with a 
     history of SRC demonstrated approximately six degrees less peak knee 
     flexion on both dominant (p = 0.03, d = 0.71) and nondominant (p = 
     0.02, d = 0.78) limbs during the land-and-cut tasks compared to 
     controls. Verbal Memory, knee flexion, and Go/No Go total score (C5.0 
     decision tree algorithm) were identified as the strongest indicators 
     of previous SRC injury history. Reduced knee flexion during 
     sport-specific land-and-cut tasks may be a mechanism for increased LE 
     injury risk in athletes with a history of SRC. There appears to be 
     multiple biomechanical and cognitive predictors for identifying 
     previous SRC in collegiate athletes, providing evidence to support a 
     multifactorial SRC management strategy to reduce future injury risk.]

     AB: Purpose: To investigate early structural and mechanical 
     predictors of plantarflexor muscle strength and the magnitude of 
     Achilles tendon (AT) nonuniform displacement at 6 and 12 months after 
     AT rupture. Methods: Thirty-five participants (28 males and 7 
     females; mean ± SD age 41.7 ± 11.1 years) were assessed for 
     isometric plantarflexion maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and AT 
     nonuniformity at 6 and 12 months after rupture. Structural and 
     mechanical AT and plantarflexor muscle properties were measured at 2 
     months. Limb asymmetry index (LSI) was calculated for all variables. 
     Multiple linear regression was used with the 6 and 12 month MVC LSI 
     and 12 month AT nonuniformity LSI as dependent variables and AT and 
     plantarflexor muscle properties at 2 months as independent variables. 
     The level of pre- and post-injury sports participation was inquired 
     using Tegner score at 2 and 12 months (scale 0-10, 10 = best possible 
     score). Subjective perception of recovery was assessed with Achilles 
     tendon total rupture score (ATRS) at 12 months (scale 0-100, 100=best 
     possible score). Results: Achilles tendon resting angle (ATRA) 
     symmetry at 2 months predicted MVC symmetry at 6 and 12 months after 
     rupture (β = 2.530, 95% CI 1.041-4.018, adjusted R2 = 0.416, p = 
     0.002; β = 1.659, 95% CI 0.330-2.988, adjusted R2 = 0.418, p = 
     0.016, respectively). At 12 months, participants had recovered their 
     pre-injury level of sports participation (Tegner 6 ± 2 points). The 
     median (IQR) ATRS score was 92 (7) points at 12 months. Conclusion: 
     Greater asymmetry of ATRA in the early recovery phase may be a 
     predictor of plantarflexor muscle strength deficits up to 1 year 
     after rupture.]

     AB: Context: The utility of baseline vestibular and ocular motor 
     screening (VOMS) in high school and collegiate athletes is 
     demonstrated throughout the literature; however, baseline VOMS data 
     at the youth level are limited. In addition, with the recent adoption 
     of the change scoring method, there is a need to document baseline 
     VOMS total and change scores in a pediatric population. Objective: To 
     document baseline VOMS total and change scores and to document the 
     internal consistency of the VOMS in pediatric soccer athletes. We 
     hypothesized that the VOMS would demonstrate strong internal 
     consistency in pediatric soccer athletes. Design: Cross-sectional 
     study. Methods: Pediatric soccer athletes (N = 110; range = 5-12 y) 
     completed the VOMS at baseline. Descriptive statistics summarized 
     demographic information, VOMS total scores, and VOMS change scores. 
     Cronbach α assessed internal consistency for VOMS total scores and 
     change scores. Results: Twenty-one (19.1%) participants had at least 
     one total score above clinical cutoffs (≥2 on any VOMS component 
     and ≥5 cm on average near point convergence). Forty (36.4%) 
     participants had at least one change score above clinical cutoffs 
     (≥1 on any VOMS component and ≥3 cm on average near point 
     convergence). The internal consistency was strong for total scores 
     with all VOMS components included (Cronbach α = .80) and change 
     scores (Cronbach α = .89). Conclusions: Although results suggest 
     VOMS items measure distinct components of the vestibular and ocular 
     motor systems, caution should be taken when interpreting VOMS total 
     and change scores in pediatric athletes, as overreporting symptoms is 
     common, thereby impacting the false-positive rate.]

     AB: Context: There are no available questionnaires in Spanish that 
     assess the function and performance of shoulder and elbow in overhead 
     sports. The Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic (KJOC) score is a 
     reference tool for this purpose. We aimed to cross-culturally adapt 
     and investigate its measurement properties in Spanish overhead 
     athletes. Design: Cross-cultural adaptation followed the steps of 
     direct translation, back translation, comprehensibility analysis, and 
     review by the Committee of Experts. Then, symptomatic and 
     asymptomatic overhead athletes were invited to complete an electronic 
     version of the Spanish adaptation (KJOC-Sp). The structural validity 
     was evaluated through an exploratory factor analysis with principal 
     axis factoring. Hypotheses were tested for known-groups and 
     convergent validity, studying the correlation with the Shoulder Pain 
     and Disability Index and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and 
     Hand Sports Module questionnaires in symptomatic athletes. Cronbach 
     alpha was calculated for internal consistency and intraclass 
     correlation coefficient (ICC)2,1 for test-retest reliability. Floor 
     and ceiling effects and time to completion were also calculated. 
     Results: The KJOC-Sp maintained the content of the original version 
     and was adapted to the new population. One hundred participants (41 
     females and 59 males) with a mean age of 22.4 (5.9) years 
     participated in the study of measurement properties. The factor 
     analysis revealed a 1-factor solution. Symptomatic participants 
     scored significantly lower than asymptomatic, with a large effect 
     size (P < .001; r = .67). Correlations were of −.60 (P < .05) with 
     the Shoulder and Pain Disability Index questionnaire and −0.66 (P < 
     .05) with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Sports 
     Module questionnaire. Cronbach alpha was .98 (95% confidence 
     interval, .97-.98) and the ICC2,1 was .96 (95% confidence interval 
     .93-.98). No floor or ceiling effects were observed among the 
     symptomatic athletes, while mean time to completion was 121 seconds. 
     Conclusion: The KJOC-Sp is equivalent to the original score, aside 
     from valid and reliable, without floor or ceiling effects in 
     symptomatic athletes and with a low time consumption.]

     AB: Context: Contusion and soft tissue injuries are common in sports. 
     Photobiomodultion, light and laser therapy, is an effective aid to 
     increase healing rates and improve function after various injury 
     mechanisms. However, it is unclear how well photobiomodulation 
     improves function after a contusion soft tissue injury. This study 
     aimed to determine the effects of a pulsed red and blue 
     photobiomodulation light patch on muscle function following a human 
     thigh contusion injury. Design: Single-blinded randomized control 
     trial design. Methods: We enrolled 46 healthy participants. 
     Participants completed 5 visits on consecutive days. On the first 
     visit, participants completed a baseline isokinetic quadriceps 
     strength testing protocol at 60°/s and 180°/s. On the second visit, 
     participants were struck in the rectus femoris of the anterior thigh 
     with a tennis ball from a serving machine. Immediately following, 
     participants were treated for 30 minutes with an active or placebo 
     photobiomodulation patch (CareWear light patch system, CareWear 
     Corp). Following the treatment, participants completed the same 
     isokinetic quadriceps strength testing protocol. Participants 
     completed the treatment and isokinetic quadriceps strength test 
     during the following daily visits. We normalized the data by 
     calculating the percent change from baseline. We used a mixed model 
     analysis of covariance, with sex as a covariate, to determine the 
     difference between treatment groups throughout the acute recovery 
     process. Results: We found the active photobiomodulation treatment 
     significantly increased over the placebo group, quadriceps peak 
     torque during the 180°/s test (P = .030), and average power during 
     both the 60°/s (P = .041) and 180°/s (P ≤ .001) assessments. The 
     mean peak torque and average power of 180°/s, at day 4, exceeded the 
     baseline levels by 8.9% and 16.8%, respectively. Conclusions: The red 
     and blue photobiomodulation light patch improved muscle strength and 
     power during the acute healing phase of a human thigh contusion 
     injury model.]

     AB: Context: Nordic hamstring strength (NH strength) and single leg 
     bridge test (SLBT) scores are used to predict the risk of hamstring 
     strain injury. Although NH strength and SLBT scores may be related, 
     the relationship between NH strength and SLBT score remains unknown. 
     Objectives: This study investigated the relationship between NH 
     strength and SLBT scores in university soccer players. Design: 
     Cross-sectional study. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: 38 
     male university soccer players. Main Outcome Measures: NH strength 
     and SLBT scores. Interventions: A participant was instructed to lean 
     forward gradually at the slowest possible speed from a kneeling 
     posture with the knee joint flexed 90° for the NH strength 
     measurement. Participants in the SLBT crossed their arms over their 
     chests, pushed down from their heels, and lifted their hips off the 
     ground as many times as they could until they failed. We investigated 
     the relationship between NH strength and SLBT scores in the left and 
     right sides using Spearman rank correlation coefficient. 
     Additionally, we calculated the percentage of left-right asymmetry in 
     NH strength and SLBT scores and investigated the relationship between 
     these variables using Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: There 
     were no significant correlations between NH strength and SLBT scores 
     in the right (rs = .239, P = .16) and left (rs = .311, P = .065) 
     legs. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between NH 
     strength and SLBT between-limb asymmetry (r = .073, P = .671). 
     Conclusions: NH strength and SLBT scores could be different indexes, 
     indicating either maximal muscle strength or muscle endurance. Thus, 
     the findings suggested that when assessing risk factors for hamstring 
     strain injury, both NH strength and SLBT scores should be measured.]

     whether Y-Balance Test (YBT) performance and asymmetry are associated 
     with lower limb injury in elite adult football athletes. Design: A 
     prospective cohort study. Methods: Preseason YBT measures were 
     obtained from 121 male footballers participating in National League 
     One across the 2021-2022 season. Lower limb injuries were tracked 
     across the season to determine the relationship between YBT variables 
     and injury incidence using logistic regression analysis. The 
     statistical significance level was .05. Results: The average YBT 
     score was 111.0 (5.8) cm on the left limb and 112.0 (5.5) cm on the 
     right limb, with an average asymmetry of 2.3 (1.4) cm. Athletes with 
     lower YBT scores on both the left (odds ratio = 2.9; 95% confidence 
     interval, 1.7 to 4.8: P ≤ .001) and right (odds ratio = 2.3; 95% 
     confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.2: P ≤ .001) limbs were at a greater 
     risk of injury. Similarly, athletes with greater amounts of asymmetry 
     were also more likely to get injured (odds ratio = 2.1; 95% 
     confidence interval, 1.3 to 3.3: P = .002). Conclusions: Results 
     indicate that lower and asymmetrical YBT scores have a significant 
     relationship with future lower limb injuries in professional male 
     footballers. The YBT offers a simple, reliable, and effective 
     screening tool that can be used by practitioners in football to help 
     identify players at a greater risk of injury before the season 
     commences.]

     AB: Context: A healthy, 22-year-old, male NCAA Division I baseball 
     shortstop was experiencing confusion, chest pain, and tightness 
     during an off-season intersquad scrimmage. The patient did not have 
     any significant medical history or mechanism of head injury. After 
     initial evaluation from the athletic trainer, the patient's cognitive 
     status began to quickly decline. The emergency action plan was put in 
     place rapidly and referred the patient to the local emergency clinic. 
     Case Presentation: Upon arrival at the emergency department, an 
     electrocardiogram was performed to rule out myocardial infarction or 
     stroke. The first electrocardiogram results returned negative for any 
     cardiac pathology, but a stroke alert was called. The patient was 
     then transported to a level II trauma center due to continual 
     cognitive decline. The patient was diagnosed with transient ischemic 
     attack (TIA) secondary to an undiagnosed patent foramen ovale (PFO) 
     that would later be diagnosed with further evaluation 2 months after 
     the initial TIA incident. After multiple diagnostic and laboratory 
     tests, the PFO went undetected until a 2D echocardiogram was 
     performed and evaluated by a cardiologist. Management and Outcomes: 
     After the confirmation of the congenital defect, surgical 
     intervention was performed to correct the PFO using catheterization. 
     Despite multiple preparticipation examinations, electrocardiograms, 
     and examination of past family history, the PFO went undetected until 
     the patient experienced symptoms of TIA. The discovery of PFO in this 
     22-year-old athletic individual is unusual because traditional 
     screening techniques (electrocardiogram and preparticipation 
     examinations) failed to detect the congenital defect. Conclusions: 
     Due to the emergent and timely actions of the athletic trainer, the 
     patient has made a full recovery and is able to compete fully in 
     athletic events. This case study amplifies the need for athletic 
     trainers at all sporting events, updated and reviewed emergency 
     action plans, rapid recognition of TIA in athletic individuals, and 
     return-to-play protocol for an athletic individual after TIA.]

     AB: Lateral ankle sprains are the most common injury sustained by 
     physically active individuals. The overwhelming majority of people 
     who sprain their ankle go on to develop chronic ankle instability 
     (CAI). CAI may cause affected individuals to limit their physical 
     activity, leading to health issues such as obesity and cardiovascular 
     disease. The growing body of literature suggests that functional 
     limitations reported by individuals with CAI may lead a the decrease 
     in physical activity. This critically appraised topic sought to 
     determine if adolescent and college-aged individuals with CAI have 
     lower physical activity levels than their healthy peers. A literature 
     search was conducted in between August 2021-February 2022 using the 
     terms "chronic ankle instability" and "physical activity." Studies 
     were included if the participants were adolescent or college-aged and 
     had CAI. Three studies meeting the inclusion criteria were 
     identified. The first study reported that college students with CAI 
     walk fewer steps per week than their healthy peers, while the second 
     study observed higher physical activity levels among adolescents with 
     CAI. The third study incorporated details on how there is a high 
     prevalence of ankle injury in adolescents, so methods to prevent the 
     injury should be followed to avoid injury earlier on. Despite the 
     conflicting evidence on how CAI impacts physical activity levels, 
     physical activity remains important for long-term health. Thus, it is 
     necessary to emphasize that individuals with CAI should seek 
     treatment to mitigate recurrent ankle sprains in order to safely 
     continue with physical activity.]

     AB: Clinical Scenario: Due to the potential side effects in athletes, 
     there is a need to evaluate for cardiac-related side effects due to 
     COVID-19 infection during preparticipation examinations. Clinical 
     Question: Does advanced cardiac testing during preparticipation 
     examinations in athletes who have contracted the COVID-19 virus 
     identify cardiac abnormalities? Summary of Key Findings: The 
     literature was searched based on athletes' post-COVID-19 infection 
     who were tested for risk of sudden cardiac arrest/death. The initial 
     search yielded 32 studies, but 7 were excluded based on abstract 
     content. Of the remaining 25 studies, 17 were excluded based on 
     patient age or non-athletic populations. Four relevant studies met 
     the inclusion criteria and were included. The need for cardiac 
     screening and advanced cardiac testing was supported to identify risk 
     of sudden cardiac arrest/death during preparticipation examinations 
     in COVID-19-positive patients. Clinical Bottom Line: The use of 
     advanced cardiac testing along with a comprehensive symptom and 
     history questionnaire is essential to reduce cardiac complications 
     due to COVID-19. Symptom-based questionnaires following COVID-19 
     infection can detect possible COVID-19-related cardiac abnormalities 
     better than the standard cardiac symptom-based questionnaires alone. 
     These combined screening measures for patients with a COVID-19 
     infection can safely help return athletes to sports. Strength of 
     Recommendation: This recommendation has a strength of B based on 
     Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine due to consistently lower 
     quality limited evidence that supports the use of advanced cardiac 
     testing in identifying heart-related complications and risk of sudden 
     cardiac arrest/death in COVID-19-positive patients.]

     stroboscopic balance training program on balance scores in athletes 
     with chronic ankle instability. Balance was evaluated before and 
     after the 6-week balance training program. After the program, there 
     were no differences between the strobe and nonstrobe groups in static 
     balance. In terms of dynamic balance, the strobe group showed a 
     significant increase in limits of stability between pretest and 
     posttest and terms of dynamic balance, the strobe group showed a 
     significant increase in limits of stability between pretest and 
     posttest and had significantly greater limits of stability than the

     AB: Concussions are the leading cause of injury among youth athletes, 
     and antibiotics are the most prescribed pediatric medication in the 
     United States. Antibiotics have shown to exert neuroprotective 
     effects in animal models of traumatic brain injury, but to date, no 
     human studies exist. Between 2009 and 2019, 6,343 adolescent athletes 
     with differential antibiotic use at baseline were administered 
     Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing at 
     baseline and twice postinjury. Chronic antibiotic use was associated 
     with a reduced risk for concussion (odds ratio 0.54), increased 
     postconcussive symptomology and neurocognitive burden, and improved 
     recovery by follow-up, a median of 7 days after concussion. This 
     preliminary retrospective analysis suggests antibiotic use may impart 
     neuroprotection up to a certain severity threshold, leading to fewer, 
     yet more severe concussions that tend to recover faster.]

     AB: Background: There is an increasing need for motor assessments 
     after stroke that can be performed quickly and remotely. The Fast 
     Outcome Categorization of the Upper Limb after Stroke-4 (FOCUS-4) 
     assessment remotely classifies upper limb outcome into 1 of 4 
     categories after stroke and was developed via retrospective analysis 
     of Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores. Objective: The aim of this 
     study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of 
     FOCUS-4 assessments for categorizing upper limb outcome after stroke 
     when administered remotely during a videocall compared to an 
     in-person ARAT. Methods: Data were collected from 26 participants at 
     3 months post-stroke (3M), 27 participants at 6 months post-stroke 
     (6M), and 56 participants at the chronic stage of stroke (>6M). 
     Participants performed an in-person ARAT and a remote FOCUS-4 
     assessment administered during a videocall, and accuracy was 
     evaluated by comparing the upper limb outcome categories. 
     Participants at the chronic stage of stroke also performed a second 
     remote FOCUS-4 assessment to assess between-day reliability. Results: 
     Overall accuracy of the remote FOCUS-4 assessment was 88% at 3M and 
     96% at 6M. Overall accuracy of the first and second remote FOCUS-4 
     assessments at the chronic stage was 75% and 79%, respectively. 
     Reliability of the FOCUS-4 assessment at the chronic stage was 82%. 
     The remote FOCUS-4 assessment was most accurate and reliable for 
     participants with mild or severe upper limb functional impairment. 
     Conclusions: The remote FOCUS-4 assessment has potential to classify 
     upper limb functional capacity or to screen possible participants for 
     stroke trials, but external validation is required.]

     AB: Background: Coordination between arm movements and postural 
     adjustments is crucial for reaching-while-stepping tasks involving 
     both anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) and compensatory 
     movements to effectively propel the whole-body forward so that the 
     hand can reach the target. Stroke impairs the ability to coordinate 
     the action of multiple body segments but the underlying mechanisms 
     are unclear. Objective. To determine the effects of stroke on 
     reaching performance and APAs during whole-body reaching. Methods: We 
     tested arm reaching in standing (stand-reach) and 
     reaching-while-stepping (step-reach; 15 trials/condition) in 
     individuals with chronic stroke (n = 18) and age-matched healthy 
     subjects (n = 13). Whole-body kinematics and kinetic data were 
     collected during the tasks. The primary outcome measure for 
     step-reach was "gain" (g), defined as the extent to which the hip 
     displacement contributing to hand motion was neutralized by 
     appropriate changes in upper limb movements (g = 1 indicates complete 
     compensation) and APAs measured as spatio-temporal profiles of the 
     center-of-pressure shifts preceding stepping. Results: Individuals 
     with stroke had lower gains and altered APAs compared to healthy 
     controls. In addition, step onset was delayed, and the timing of 
     endpoint, trunk, and foot movement offset was prolonged during 
     step-reach compared to healthy controls. Those with milder 
     sensorimotor impairment and better balance function had higher gains. 
     Altered APAs were also related to reduced balance function. 
     Conclusions: Altered APAs and prolonged movement offset in stroke may 
     lead to a greater reliance on compensatory arm movements. Altered 
     APAs in individuals with stroke may be associated with a reduced 
     shift of referent body configuration during the movement]

     AB: Background: Caloric restriction promotes neuroplasticity and 
     recovery after neurological injury. In mice, we tested the hypothesis 
     that caloric restriction can act post-stroke to enhance 
     training-associated motor recovery. Methods: Mice were trained to 
     perform a skilled prehension task. We then induced a photothrombotic 
     stroke in the caudal forelimb area, after which we retrained animals 
     on the prehension task following an 8-day delay. Mice underwent 
     either ad libitum feeding or alternate day fasting beginning 1-day 
     after stroke and persisting for either 7 days or the entire 
     post-stroke training period until sacrifice. Results: Prior studies 
     have shown that post-stroke recovery of prehension can occur if 
     animals receive rehabilitative training during an early sensitive 
     period but is incomplete if rehabilitative training is delayed. In 
     contrast, we show complete recovery of prehension, despite a delay in 
     rehabilitative training, when mice underwent alternate day fasting 
     beginning 1-day post-stroke and persisting for either 7 days or the 
     entire post-stroke training period until sacrifice. Recovery was 
     independent of weight loss. Stroke volumes were similar across 
     groups. Conclusions: Post-stroke caloric restriction led to recovery 
     of motor function independent of a protective effect on stroke 
     volume. Prehension recovery improved even after ad libitum feeding 
     was reinstituted suggesting that the observed motor recovery was not 
     merely a motivational response. These data add to the growing 
     evidence that post-stroke caloric restriction can enhance recovery.]

     characteristics associated with affect and cognition among stroke 
     survivors provides insight into preventing poststroke affective and 
     cognitive impairment. Objective: To examine the associations of RAR 
     characteristics with affect and cognition among community-dwelling 
     stroke survivors. Methods: Forty participants with mild stroke (mean 
     age = 52.8; 42.5% female; 55% White) reported their affect and 
     cognitive complaints using ecological momentary assessment and wore 
     an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days and completed the National 
     Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery. RAR characteristics 
     were extracted using parametric and non-parametric approaches. 
     Multivariable linear regressions were used to identify RAR 
     characteristics associated with affect and cognition. Results: Later 
     onset of rest (B = 0.45; P = .008) and activity (B = 0.36; P = .041) 
     were positively associated with depressed affect. These associations 
     were reversed for cheerful effect (rest onset: B = −0.42; P = .017; 
     activity onset: B = −0.39; P = .033). Cheerful affect was also 
     positively associated with relative amplitude (ie, distinctions in 
     activity levels between rest and activity; B = .39; P = .030). 
     Intra-daily variability (ie, RAR fragmentation; B = 0.35; P = .042) 
     and later onset of activity (B = .36; P = .048) were positively 
     associated with cognitive complaints. Less erratic RAR was positively 
     associated with fluid cognition (B = 0.29; P = .036); RAR 
     fragmentation was positively associated with crystallized cognition 
     (B = 0.39; P = .015). Conclusions: We identified RAR correlates of 
     affect and cognition among stroke survivors, highlighting the value 
     of managing RAR and sleep in stroke rehabilitation. Future studies 
     should test whether advancing the onset of rest and activity, 
     promoting a regular active lifestyle, and improving rest and sleep in 
     the nighttime protect stroke survivors from affective and cognitive 
     impairment]

     trials. Identifying modifiable recruitment and enrollment barriers 
     for women can improve study generalizability, statistical power, and 
     resource utilization. Objective: In a post-stroke neuromodulation 
     study, we determined the impact of sex on the occurrence of exclusion 
     criteria and compared the sex distribution of screened and enrolled 
     individuals with a broader stroke-affected population. Methods: A 
     total of 335 individuals with chronic stroke were screened for a 
     study examining how neuromodulation and high-intensity treadmill 
     training affect walking speed and corticomotor excitability. 
     Demographics and exclusions were retrospectively gathered as a 
     secondary dataset. Exclusion criteria consisted of 6 categories (not 
     target population, unable to do treadmill protocol, unable to do 
     non-invasive brain stimulation, insufficient ankle motion and 
     disinterest, and cognitive impairment). Incidence of each exclusion 
     criterion was compared between women and men. The sex distribution 
     was compared to a dataset from Chicago primary stroke centers. 
     Results: A total of 81 individuals were enrolled and 254 were not. 
     The percentage of women excluded was significantly greater than that 
     of men (P = .04). No individual exclusion criterion or categories 
     excluded women more frequently than men. Screened and enrolled 
     individuals had a lower proportion of women and younger age than a 
     representative stroke population (P < .001). Conclusions: We 
     identified exclusion criteria (ie, headaches, cognitive scores, and 
     age) that are modifiable barriers to enrollment of women in this 
     post-stroke neuromodulation study. Addressing underrepresentation of 
     women in stroke research is pivotal for enhancing generalizability, 
     achieving statistical power, and optimizing resources.]

     AB: Background: Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation 
     (AtDCS), a neuromodulatory technique, has been applied to treat 
     traumatic brain injury (TBI) in patients and was reported to promote 
     functional improvement. We evaluated the effect of contralesional 
     AtDCS on axonal sprouting of the intact corticospinal tract (CST) and 
     the underlying mechanism in a TBI mouse model to provide more 
     preclinical evidence for the use of AtDCS to treat TBI. Methods: TBI 
     was induced in mice by a contusion device. Then, the mice were 
     subjected to contralesional AtDCS 5 days per week followed by a 2-day 
     interval for 7 weeks. After AtDCS, motor function was evaluated by 
     the irregular ladder walking, narrow beam walking, and open field 
     tests. CST sprouting was assessed by anterograde and retrograde 
     labeling of corticospinal neurons (CSNs), and the effect of AtDCS was 
     further validated by pharmacogenetic inhibition of axonal sprouting 
     using clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Results: TBI resulted in damage to the 
     ipsilesional cortex, while the contralesional CST remained intact. 
     AtDCS improved the skilled motor functions of the impaired hindlimb 
     in TBI mice by promoting CST axon sprouting, specifically from the 
     intact hemicord to the denervated hemicord. Furthermore, electrical 
     stimulation of CSNs significantly increased the excitability of 
     neurons and thus activated the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
     pathway. Conclusions: Contralesional AtDCS improved skilled motor 
     following TBI, partly by promoting axonal sprouting through increased 
     neuronal activity and thus activation of the mTOR pathway.]

     AB: Background: Stroke can impair manual dexterity, leading to loss 
     of independence following incomplete recovery. Enhancing our 
     understanding of dexterity impairment may improve 
     neurorehabilitation. Objectives: The study aimed to measure dexterity 
     components in acute stroke patients with and without hand motor 
     deficits, compare them to those of healthy controls (HC), and to 
     explore the neural substrates involved in specific components of 
     dexterity. Methods: We used the Dextrain Manipulandum to quantify 
     fine finger force control, finger selection accuracy, coactivation, 
     and reaction time (RT). Dexterity was evaluated twice (2 days apart) 
     in 74 patients and 14 HC. Voxel-Lesion-Symptom-Mapping (VLSM) was 
     used to analyze the relationship between tissue damage and dexterity. 
     Results. Due to severe paresis or fatigue, 24 patients could not 
     perform these tasks. In 50 patients (included 4.6 ± 3.3 days 
     post-stroke), finger force control improved (P < .001), as it did in 
     HC (P = .03) who performed better than patients on both evaluations. 
     Accuracy of finger selection did not improve significantly in any 
     group, but the HC performed better on both evaluations. Unexpectedly, 
     coactivation was better in patients than in HC at D3 (P = .03). There 
     were no between-group differences in RT. VLSM showed that damage to 
     the superior temporal gyrus (STG) impaired finger force control while 
     damage to the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) impaired 
     finger selectivity. Conclusions: Acute stroke affecting the STG or 
     PLIC impaired selective components of dexterity. Patients with mild 
     to moderate impairment showed better finger force control and 
     accuracy selection within 48 hours, suggesting the feasibility of 
     detecting early dexterity improvements.]

     AB: Background: Despite a growing interest in gaming rehabilitation 
     for upper limb (UL) recovery post-stroke, studies investigating the 
     effects of game-based rehabilitation incorporating functional games 
     are lacking. Objective: To investigate the efficacy of an intensive, 
     functional, gamified rehabilitation program compared to task-based 
     training on UL motor function in acute/sub-acute stroke survivors. 
     Methods: This randomized, multicenter, single-blind, clinical trial 
     comprises 120 participants with unilateral stroke who were randomized 
     to receive either gamified training (n = 64) using the ArmAble™ 
     [experimental group (EG)] or task-based training (n = 56) in 
     conjunction with conventional therapy for 2 hours per day, 6 days per 
     week for 2 weeks, followed by UL rehabilitation for another 4 weeks 
     at home. Primary outcomes evaluated by a blinded assessor included 
     the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FM-UE), and Action 
     Research Arm Test (ARAT). Data were analyzed using a linear 
     mixed-effect regression model. Results: The mean (standard deviation) 
     age of the participants was 54.4 ± 11.7 years (78.1% men) in the EG 
     and 57.7 ± 10.9 years (73.2% men) in the comparator group (CG). The 
     median (interquartile range) time since stroke was 30.0 (54.0) days 
     in the EG and 22.5 (45.0) days in the CG. Following the 2-week 
     intervention, a statistically significant improvement was observed in 
     the EG for the FM-UE [between-group mean differences (95% confidence 
     interval): −3.9 (−6.5, −1.3); P = .003]; but not for the ARAT 
     [−2.9 (−5.8, 0.0); P = .051]. Gains at 6 weeks were significantly

     in post-stroke fatigue (PSF). While the effect of perceptual load on 
     top-down attentional processing is known, here we investigate if 
     increasing perceptual load modulates bottom-up attentional processing 
     in a fatigue dependent manner. Methods: In this cross-sectional 
     observational study, in 29 first-time stroke survivors with no 
     clinical depression, an auditory oddball task consisting of target, 
     standard, and novel tones was performed in conditions of low and high 
     perceptual load. Electroencephalography was used to measure auditory 
     evoked potentials. Perceived effort was rated using the visual analog 
     scale at regular intervals during the experiment. Fatigue was 
     measured using the fatigue severity scale. The effect of fatigue and 
     perceptual load on behavior (response time, accuracy, and effort 
     rating) and auditory evoked potentials (amplitude and latency) was 
     examined using mixed model ananlysis of variances (ANOVA). Results: 
     Response time was prolonged with greater perceptual load and fatigue. 
     There was no effect of load or fatigue on accuracy. Greater effort 
     was reported with higher perceptual load both in high and low 
     fatigue. p300a amplitude of auditory evoked potentials (AEP) for 
     novel stimuli was attenuated in high fatigue with increasing load 
     when compared to low fatigue. Latency of p300a was longer in low 
     fatigue with increasing load when compared to high fatigue. There 
     were no effects on p300b components, with smaller N100 in high load 
     conditions. Interpretation: High fatigue specific modulation of p300a 
     component of AEP with increasing load is indicative of distractor 
     driven alteration in orienting response, suggestive of compromise in 
     bottom-up selective attention in PSF.]

     AB: Background: Preconditioning with cathodal high-definition 
     transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) can potentiate 
     cortical plasticity induced by intermittent theta burst stimulation 
     (iTBS) and enhance the after-effects of iTBS in healthy people. 
     However, it is unclear whether this multi-modal protocol can enhance 
     upper limb function in patients with stroke. Objective: The aim of 
     this study was to investigate whether priming iTBS with cathodal 
     HD-tDCS over the ipsilesional M1 can augment upper limb motor 
     recovery in poststroke patients. Methods: A total of 66 patients with 
     subacute stroke were randomly allocated into 3 groups. Group 1 
     received priming iTBS with HD-tDCS (referred to as the tDCS + iTBS 
     group), Group 2 received non-priming iTBS (the iTBS group), and Group 
     3 received sham stimulation applied to the ipsilesional M1. One 
     session was performed per day, 5 days per week, for 3 consecutive 
     weeks. In Group 1, iTBS was preceded by a 20-minute session of 
     cathodal HD-tDCS at a 10-minute interval. The primary outcome measure 
     was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) score. 
     Moreover, the secondary outcome measures for muscle strength and 
     spasticity were the Motricity Index-Upper Extremity (MI-UE) and the 
     Modified Ashworth Scale Upper-Extremity (MAS-UE), respectively, and 
     the Hong Kong Version of the Functional Test for the Hemiplegic Upper 
     Extremity (FTHUE-HK) and the Modified Barthel Index (MBI) for 
     activity and participation. Results: Significant differences were 
     detected in the changes in FMA-UE, MI-UE, and MBI scores between the 
     3 groups from baseline to post-intervention (χ2FMA-UE = 10.856, P = 
     .004; χ2MI-UE = 6.783, P = .034; χ2MBI = 9.608, P = .008). Post hoc 
     comparisons revealed that the priming iTBS group demonstrated 
     substantial improvements in FMA-UE (P = .004), MI-UE (P = .028), and 
     MBI (P = 0.006) compared with those in the sham group. However, no 
     significant difference was observed between the iTBS group and the 
     sham group. Moreover, no significant differences were found in the 
     changes in MAS-UE or FTHUE-HK between the groups. Conclusions: 
     Priming iTBS with HD-tDCS over the ipsilesional M1 cortex had 
     beneficial effects on augmenting upper limb motor recovery and 
     enhancing daily participation among subacute stroke patients.]

     AB: Background: Participation restrictions following traumatic brain 
     injury are associated with executive function (EF) deficits (EFDs). 
     The subacute recovery phase's specific characteristics (enhanced 
     brain plasticity and impaired self-awareness) and contextual factors 
     (inpatient setting) warrant adjusting cognitive rehabilitation 
     protocols. The Intervention of Participation and Executive Functions 
     (I-PEX) was designed to improve EFDs during subacute inpatient 
     rehabilitation. Objective: To investigate the I-PEX's preliminary 
     efficacy to improve EFDs during the performance of complex daily 
     activities and enhance self-awareness, cognitive self-efficacy, 
     participation, and quality of life postdischarge. Methods: A pilot 
     pre-, post-, and follow-up double-blind randomized controlled trial 
     with 25 participants randomly allocated to the I-PEX (n = 13) or 
     treatment-as-usual (n = 12) group. Cognitive assessments were 
     administered pre- and postintervention, and quality of life and 
     participation questionnaires 1-month postdischarge. Data analysis 
     included repeated measures analysis of variance mixed design and 
     independent t-tests, extracting effect sizes. Results: Significant 
     group-by-time interaction effect with a medium effect size was found 
     for the primary outcome measure; EFs manifested in complex daily 
     activities, indicating a larger improvement for the experimental 
     group. The group effect was not significant. The experimental group's 
     mean delta score (pre-post improvement) was significantly higher 
     (1.75 ± 2.89; t(23) = 2.52, P = .019), with a large effect size (d = 
     1.012, 95% confidence interval [0.166-1.840]). We found no 
     significant group and interaction effects for EFs, self-awareness, 
     and cognitive self-efficacy or no significant differences in 
     participation or quality of life postdischarge. Conclusions: Results 
     provide initial evidence for the I-PEX efficacy in treating EFDs in

     AB: Background: The potential for aerobic exercise (AE) to enhance 
     neuroplasticity post-stroke has been theorized but not systematically 
     investigated. Our aim was to determine the effects of forced-rate AE 
     (FE) paired with upper extremity (UE) repetitive task practice (FE + 
     RTP) compared to time-matched UE RTP (RTP only) on motor recovery. 
     Methods: A single center randomized clinical trial was conducted from 
     April 2019 to December 2022. Sixty individuals ≥6 months 
     post-stroke with UE hemiparesis were randomized to FE + RTP (N = 30) 
     or RTP only (N = 30), completing 90-minute sessions, 3×/week for 8 
     weeks. The FE + RTP group underwent 45-minute of FE (5-minute 
     warm-up, 35-minute main set, and 5-minute cool down) followed by 
     45-minute of UE RTP. The RTP only group completed 90-minute of RTP. 
     Primary outcomes were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and Action 
     Research Arm Test (ARAT). The 6-minute Walk Test (6MWT, secondary 
     outcome) assessed walking capacity. Results: Sixty individuals 
     enrolled and 56 completed the study. The RTP only group completed 
     more RTP in terms of repetitions (411.8 ± 44.4 vs 222.8 ± 28.4, P < 
     .001) and time (72.7 ± 6.7 vs 37.8 ± 2.4 minutes, P < .001) versus 
     FE + RTP. There was no significant difference between groups on the 
     FMA (FE + RTP, 36.2 ± 10.1-44.0 ± 11.8 and RTP only, 34.4 ± 
     11.0-41.2 ± 13.4, P = .43) or ARAT (FE + RTP, 32.5 ± 16.6-37.7 ± 
     17.9 and RTP only, 32.8 ± 18.6-36.4 ± 18.5, P = .88). The FE + RTP 
     group demonstrated greater improvements on the 6MWT (274.9 ± 
     122.0-327.1 ± 141.2 m) versus RTP only (285.5 ± 160.3-316.9 ± 
     170.0, P = .003). Conclusions: There was no significant difference 
     between groups in the primary outcomes. The FE + RTP improved more on 
     the 6MWT, a secondary outcome.]

     AB: Background: Rehabilitative treatments that promote 
     neuroplasticity are believed to improve recovery after stroke. Animal 
     studies have shown that cardiovascular exercise (CE) promotes 
     neuroplasticity but the effects of this intervention on the human 
     brain and its implications for the functional recovery of patients 
     remain unclear. The use of biomarkers has enabled the assessment of 
     cellular and molecular events that occur in the central nervous 
     system after brain injury. Some of these biomarkers have proven to be 
     particularly valuable for the diagnosis of severity, prognosis of 
     recovery, as well as for measuring the neuroplastic response to 
     different treatments after stroke. Objectives: To provide a critical 
     analysis on the current evidence supporting the use of 
     neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers to assess the 
     neuroplastic response to CE in individuals poststroke. Results: Most 
     biomarkers used are responsive to the effects of acute and chronic CE 
     interventions, but the response appears to be variable and is not 
     consistently associated with functional improvements. Small sample 
     sizes, methodological variability, incomplete information regarding 
     patient's characteristics, inadequate standardization of training 
     parameters, and lack of reporting of associations with functional 
     outcomes preclude the quantification of the neuroplastic effects of 
     CE poststroke using biomarkers. Conclusion: Consensus on the optimal 
     biomarkers to monitor the neuroplastic response to CE is currently 
     lacking. By addressing critical methodological issues, future studies 
     could advance our understanding of the use of biomarkers to measure 
     the impact of CE on neuroplasticity and functional recovery in 
     patients with stroke.]

     recordings, however scoring is time-consuming and expert knowledge is 
     required for an appropriate assessment. Objective: To explore a 
     machine learning approach for automated classification of amplitude 
     and duration of distal leg dystonia and choreoathetosis within short 
     video sequences. Methods: Available videos of a heel-toe tapping task 
     were preprocessed to optimize key point extraction using markerless 
     motion analysis. Postprocessed key point data were passed to a time 
     series classification ensemble algorithm to classify dystonia and 
     choreoathetosis duration and amplitude classes (scores 0, 1, 2, 3, 
     and 4), respectively. As ground truth clinical scoring of dystonia 
     and choreoathetosis by the Dyskinesia Impairment Scale was used. 
     Multiclass performance metrics as well as metrics for summarized 
     scores: absence (score 0) and presence (score 1-4) were determined. 
     Results: Thirty-three participants were included: 29 with dyskinetic 
     CP and 4 typically developing, age 14 years:6 months ± 5 years:15 
     months. The multiclass accuracy results for dystonia were 77% for 
     duration and 68% for amplitude; for choreoathetosis 30% for duration 
     and 38% for amplitude. The metrics for score 0 versus score 1 to 4 
     revealed an accuracy of 81% for dystonia duration, 77% for dystonia 
     amplitude, 53% for choreoathetosis duration and amplitude. 
     Conclusions: This methodology study yielded encouraging results in 
     distinguishing between presence and absence of dystonia, but not for 
     choreoathetosis. A larger dataset is required for models to 
     accurately represent distinct classes/scores. This study presents a 
     novel methodology of automated assessment of movement disorders

     AB: Background: Recent evidence demonstrates that manually triggered 
     vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) combined with rehabilitation leads to 
     increased recovery of upper limb motor function after stroke. This 
     approach is premised on studies demonstrating that the timing of 
     stimulation relative to movements is a key determinant in the 
     effectiveness of this approach. Objective: The overall goal of the 
     study was to identify an algorithm that could be used to 
     automatically trigger VNS on the best movements during rehabilitative 
     exercises while maintaining a desired interval between stimulations 
     to reduce the burden of manual stimulation triggering. Methods: To 
     develop the algorithm, we analyzed movement data collected from 
     patients with a history of neurological injury. We applied 3 
     different algorithms to the signal, analyzed their triggering 
     choices, and then validated the best algorithm by comparing 
     triggering choices to those selected by a therapist delivering VNS 
     therapy. Results: The dynamic algorithm triggered above the 95th 
     percentile of maximum movement at a rate of 5.09 (interquartile range 
     [IQR] = 0.74) triggers per minute. The periodic algorithm produces 
     stimulation at set intervals but low movement selectivity (34.05%, 
     IQR = 7.47), while the static threshold algorithm produces long 
     interstimulus intervals (27.16 ± 2.01 seconds) with selectivity of 
     64.49% (IQR = 25.38). On average, the dynamic algorithm selects 
     movements that are 54 ± 3% larger than therapist-selected movements. 
     Conclusions: This study shows that a dynamic algorithm is an 
     effective strategy to trigger VNS during the best movements at a 
     reliable triggering rate.]

     AB: Background: The application of neuroimaging-based biomarkers in 
     stroke has enriched our understanding of post-stroke recovery 
     mechanisms, including alterations in functional connectivity based on 
     synchronous oscillatory activity across various cortical regions. 
     Phase-amplitude coupling, a type of cross-frequency coupling, may 
     provide additional mechanistic insight. Objective: To determine how 
     the phase of prefrontal cortex delta (1-3 Hz) oscillatory activity 
     mediates the amplitude of motor cortex beta (13-20 Hz) oscillations 
     in individual's early post-stroke. Methods: Participants admitted to 
     an inpatient rehabilitation facility completed resting and task-based 
     EEG recordings and motor assessments around the time of admission and 
     discharge along with structural neuroimaging. Unimpaired controls 
     completed EEG procedures during a single visit. Mixed-effects linear 
     models were performed to assess within- and between-group differences 
     in delta-beta prefrontomotor coupling. Associations between coupling 
     and motor status and injury were also determined. Results: Thirty 
     individuals with stroke and 17 unimpaired controls participated. 
     Coupling was greater during task versus rest conditions for all 
     participants. Though coupling during affected extremity task 
     performance decreased during hospitalization, coupling remained 
     elevated at discharge compared to controls. Greater baseline coupling 
     was associated with better motor status at admission and discharge 
     and positively related to motor recovery. Coupling demonstrated both 
     positive and negative associations with injury involving measures of 
     lesion volume and overlap injury to anterior thalamic radiation, 
     respectively. Conclusions: This work highlights the utility of 
     prefrontomotor cross-frequency coupling as a potential motor status 
     and recovery biomarker in stroke. The frequency- and region-specific 
     neurocircuitry featured in this work may also facilitate novel

     Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth 
     Sleepiness Scale, and STOP-Bang Questionnaire. The dependent variable 
     was measured 3 years after the first contact by the Modified Rankin 
     Scale (mRS). Step-wise multiple linear regression analysis was 
     employed to identify which sleep alterations were associated with 
     disability. Results: Sixty-five individuals with stroke participated. 
     About 67.7% of participants had poor sleep quality, 52.4% reported 
     insomnia symptoms, 33.9% reported excessive daytime sleepiness, and 
     80.0% were classified as intermediate or high risk for obstructive 
     sleep apnea. Only risk for obstructive sleep apnea was significantly 
     associated with disability and explained 5% of the variance in the 
     mRS scores. Conclusion: Self-reported sleep alterations had a 
     considerable frequency in a sample of chronic stroke individuals. The 
     risk of obstructive sleep apnea was associated with disability in the 
     chronic stage of stroke. Sleep alterations must be considered and 
     evaluated in the rehabilitation process even after a long period 
     since the stroke onset.]

     AB: Objective: The aim of the paper was to investigate the 
     composition and structure of intestinal flora in patients with 
     cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS), and to investigate the relationship 
     between gut microbiota (GM) and different levels of stroke severity. 
     Methods: In this study, 47 CIS patients (16 mild, 21 moderate, and 10 
     severe) and 15 healthy controls were included. General information, 
     clinical data, and behavioral scores of the enrolled subjects were 
     collected. Deoxyribonucleic acid in fecal intestinal flora was 
     extracted and detected using high-throughput Illumina 16S ribosomal 
     ribonucleic acid sequencing technology. Finally, the correlation 
     between the community composition of intestinal microbiota and 
     National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score in CIS 
     patients was analyzed. Results: Compared with healthy controls, there 
     was no statistically significant difference in Alpha diversity among 
     CIS patients, but the principal coordinate analysis showed 
     significant differences in the composition of the GM among stroke 
     patients with different degrees of severity and controls. In CIS 
     patients, Streptococcus was significantly enriched, and 
     Eshibacter-Shigella, Bacteroides, and Agathobacter were significantly 
     down-regulated (P < .05). In addition, the relative abundance of 
     Blautia was negatively correlated with the NIHSS score. Conclusions: 
     Our results show that different degrees of CIS severity exert 
     distinct effects on the intestinal microbiome. This study reveals the 
     intestinal microecological changes after brain injury from the 
     perspective of brain-gut axis. Intestinal microorganisms not only 
     reveal the possible pathological process and indicate the severity of 
     neurologic impairment, but also make targeted therapy possible for 
     CIS patients.]

     AB: Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) 
     is a nonpharmacological and noninvasive brain stimulation technique 
     that has been proven to be effective in Parkinson's disease (PD). The 
     combination of rTMS and treadmill training improved gait function in 
     PD greater than treadmill training alone. Objective: The aim of our 
     study was to evaluate the combination of a novel high-intensity, 
     short intervention rTMS treatment and a multimodal treatment protocol 
     including of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and language 
     therapy, the so-called Parkinson's Disease Multimodal Complex 
     Treatment (PD-MCT), to improve motor function. Methods: In this 
     randomized double-blind sham-controlled trial rTMS with 48 Hz or sham 
     was applied over the cerebellum 3 times a day for 5 consecutive days. 
     Patients were assessed at baseline (V0), after 5 days of treatment 
     (V1), and 4 weeks later (V2). The primary clinical outcome measure 
     was the motor sum-score of the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRSIII), 
     secondary clinical outcomes were quantitative motor tasks. Results: A 
     total of 36 PD patients were randomly allocated either to rTMS (n = 
     20) or sham (n = 16), both combined with PD-MCT. rTMS improved the 
     UDPRSIII score comparing baseline and V1 in the treatment group by 
     −8.2 points (P = .004). The 8MW and dynamic posturography remained 
     unchanged in both groups after intervention. Conclusion. Compressing 
     weeks of canonical rTMS protocols into 5 days was effective and well 
     tolerated. rTMS may serve as an add-on therapy for augmenting the 
     multimodal complex treatment of motor symptoms, but seems to be 
     ineffective to treat postural instability.]

     AB: Type 1 allergic disease is a global challenge, hence the search 
     for alternative therapies. Mushrooms have several medicinal and 
     health benefits. However, scant data exist on the anti-allergic 
     properties of polysaccharides from fruiting bodies (FB) and mycelia 
     of mushrooms. We used an in vitro co-culture system comprising Caco-2 
     cells (intestinal epithelial colorectal carcinoma cell line) and 
     RBL-2H3 cells (cell line from rat basophilic leukemia cells). 
     Reduction in degranulation of mast cells indicated anti-allergy 
     properties. The inhibitory effect of crude polysaccharides from 
     different mushroom FB and mycelia on β-hexosaminidase release from 
     RBL-2H3 cells was measured. Results showed that crude polysaccharides 
     from the FB of Inonotus obliquus exhibited a significant inhibitory 
     effect on β-hexosaminidase release and lowered it by 16%. 
     Polysaccharides from the FB of Lentinus squarrosulus, and Pleurotus 
     ostreatus did not exhibit a significant reduction in 
     β-hexosaminidase. However, crude polysaccharides from their mycelia 
     had a significant inhibitory effect, resulting in up to a 23% 
     reduction in β-hexosaminidase activity. Among fungi showing 
     degranulation properties, crude polysaccharides from their mycelia 
     showed more potent action against degranulation than their 
     corresponding FB. Polysaccharides extracted from FB and or mycelia, 
     of selected mushrooms, possess anti-allergic properties that could be 
     harnessed for use in alternative allergy therapies.]

     AB: Ganoderic acid A (GAA) is one of the major triterpenoids in 
     Ganoderma lucidum (GL). Accumulating evidence has indicated that GAA 
     demonstrates multiple pharmacological effects and exhibits treatment 
     potential for various neurological disorders. Here, the effects and 
     mechanisms of GAA in the treatment of neurological disorders were 
     evaluated and discussed through previous research results. By 
     summarizing previous research results, we found that GAA may play a 
     neuroprotective role through various mechanisms: anti-inflammatory, 
     anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, protection of nerve cells, and 
     regulation of nerve growth factor. Therefore, GAA is a promising 
     natural neuroprotective agent and this review would contribute to the 
     future development of GAA as a novel clinical candidate drug for 
     treating neurological diseases.]

     AB: Three genetically identified and morphologically characterized 
     strains (MesAQ2-C, MesAQ6-2 and MesFI2-3) of the culinary-medicinal 
     ascomycete mushroom Morchella esculenta (L.) Pers. collected in 
     central-north Italy have been studied for their antifungal and 
     antibacterial activities. The obtained data showed that mycelium of 
     M. esculenta possess variable antimicrobial activity against four 
     test fungi (Chrysosporium keratinophilum, Microsporum gypseum, 
     Trichophyton terrestre, Penicillium griseofulvum), as well as one 
     Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and three Gram negative 
     (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) 
     test bacteria potentially pathogenic for humans and animals. Up to 
     20.4% of inhibition of the average mycelial growth rate (GRavr) of 
     test fungi in dual culture experiment was detected. The samples of 
     cultural liquid (CL) and mycelial extract (ME) obtained by static 
     cultivation of M. esculenta strains showed up to 13.9 and 23.0% of 
     GRavr inhibition of test fungi, respectively. Similarly, the 
     inhibition of the bacterial colonies by CL and ME samples was 34.1 
     and 32.3%, respectively in comparison with the control with 
     streptomycin indicating almost equal secretion of both intra- and 
     extracellular antimicrobial compounds by M. esculenta mycelium. As a 
     producer of antimicrobial compounds among tested M. esculenta 
     strains, MesAQ2-C was the most effective. It may be considered for 
     further myco-pharmacological research to develop mushroom-based 
     antimicrobial biotech products with biomedical significance.]

     AB: In the present study, a new galectin designated Cyclocybe 
     cylindracea lectin (CCL) was extracted from the fruiting bodies of 
     the wild black popular mushroom C. cylindracea grown in Algeria. The 
     protein was isolated using sepharose 4B as affinity chromatography 
     matrix, and galactose as elutant. The purified galectin was composed 
     of two subunits of 17.873 kDa each, with a total molecular mass of 
     35.6 kDa. Its agglutinant activity was impeded by galactose and its 
     derivatives, as well as melibiose. Lactose showed the highest 
     affinity, with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.0781 mM. CCL 
     was sensitive to extreme pH conditions, and its binding function 
     decreased when incubated with 10 mM EDTA, and it could be restored by 
     metallic cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+. CCL agglutinated human 
     red blood cells, without any discernible specificity. Circular 
     dichroism spectra demonstrated that its secondary structure contained 
     β-sheet as dominant fold. In addition, bioinformatics investigation 
     on their peptide fingerprint obtained after MALDI-TOF/TOF ionization 
     using mascot software confirmed that CCL was not like any previous 
     purified lectin from mushroom: instead, it possessed an amino acid 
     composition with high similarity to that of the putative urea 
     carboxylase of Emericella nidulans (strain FGSC A4/ATCC 38163/CBS

     This study aims to obtain a comprehensive transcriptome assembly 
     during the Ph. igniarius liquid fermentation and characterize the key 
     genes associated with the mycelial growth and metabolism in Ph. 
     igniarius JQ9. Our transcriptome data of Ph. iniarius JQ9 and the 
     wild strain were obtained with the Illumina platform comparative 
     transcriptome sequencing technology. The results showed that among 
     all the 346 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 245 were 
     upregulated and 101 were downregulated. Candidate genes encoding 
     endoglucanase, beta-glucosidase, cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase, 
     glycoside hydrolase family 61 protein, were proposed to participate 
     in the carbohydrate utilization from KEGG enrichment of the starch 
     and sucrose metabolism pathways were upregulated in Ph. igniarius 
     JQ9. In addition, three candidate genes encoding the laccase and 
     another two candidate genes related with the cell growth were higher 
     expressed in Ph. igniarius JQ9 than in the wild type of strain (CK). 
     Analysis of these data revealed that increased these related 
     carbohydrate metabolism candidate genes underlying one crucial way

     AB: Background: Type C3 distal tibial plafond fractures consistently 
     show poor outcomes with high complication rates and significant risk 
     of posttraumatic arthritis. We describe a minimally invasive 
     technique of performing a primary ankle fusion using an anterograde 
     tibial nail and compare our early results to traditional methods of 
     fixation. Methods: During the acute admission, the patient undergoes 
     an arthroscopic preparation of the ankle joint and insertion of an 
     anterograde nail into the talus. This technique is described in 
     detail and presented alongside a retrospective 5-year review of all 
     adult C3 distal tibial plafond fractures from our center. Results: 
     Twenty-six patients (8 open fractures) had been fixed traditionally 
     using open reduction internal fixation (24 patients) and circular 
     frames (2 patients) with an average follow-up of 20 months. Those 
     internally fixed had protected weightbearing for 3 months. 
     Complications included deep infection (12%), nonunion (8%), malunion 
     (4%), severe posttraumatic osteoarthritis (27%), and the secondary 
     conversion to ankle replacement/fusion (12%) requiring an average of 
     3 reoperations. Six patients underwent primary fusion (3 open 
     fractures) with an average follow-up of 18 months. Patients were 
     allowed to immediately weightbear. There were no reported 
     complications and the primary fusion group demonstrated shorter 
     hospital stays, faster return to work, and higher mean self-reported 
     foot and ankle score (SEFAS) compared to those treated with ORIF. 
     Conclusion: C3 distal tibial plafond fractures are difficult to 
     manage and there has not been a satisfactory method of treating them 
     that allows early return to work, has a low risk of complications, 
     and reduces the risk of posttraumatic tibiotalar arthritis. We 
     present our initial results with a method that uses traditional 
     arthroscopic techniques to prepare the tibiotalar joint together with 
     minimally invasive anterograde tibiotalar nailing. In this initial 
     report of a small group of patients, we found that surgery can be 
     performed once the swelling has subsided after injury and that 
     allowing weightbearing as tolerated did not appear to have a negative 
     effect on initial outcomes.]

     AB: Background: Painful degenerative joint disease (DJD) of the first 
     metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP I), or hallux rigidus, mainly occurs 
     in later stages of life. For end-stage hallux rigidus, MTP I 
     arthrodesis is considered the gold standard. As young and active 
     patients are affected considerably less frequently, it currently 
     remains unclear, whether they benefit to the same extent. We 
     hypothesized that MTP I arthrodesis in younger patients would lead to 
     an inferior outcome with decreased rates of overall with lower rates 
     of patient postoperative pain and function compared to an older 
     cohort. Methods: All patients aged <50 years who underwent MTP I 
     arthrodesis at our institution between 1995 and 2012 were included in 
     this study. This group was then matched and compared with a group of 
     patients aged >60 years. Minimum follow-up was 10 years. Outcome 
     measures were Tegner activity score (TAS), a "Virtual Tegner activity 
     score" (VTAS), the visual analog scale (VAS), and the Foot Function 
     index (FFI). Results: Sixty-one MTP I fusions (n = 28 young, n = 33 
     old) in 46 patients were included in our study at an average of 14 
     years after surgery. Younger patients experienced significantly more 
     pain relief as reflected by changes in VAS and FFI Pain subscale 
     scores. No difference in functional outcomes was found with change in 
     the FFI function subscale or in the ability to have desired 
     functional outcomes using the ratio of TAS to VTAS. Revision rate did 
     not differ between the two groups apart from hardware removal, which 
     was significantly more likely in the younger group. Conclusion: In 
     patients below the age of 50 years with end-stage DJD of the first 
     metatarsal joint, MTP I arthrodesis not only yielded highly 
     satisfactory postoperative results at least equal outcome compared to 
     an older cohort of patients aged >60 years at an average 14 years' 
     follow-up. Based on these findings, we consider first metatarsal 
     joint fusion even for young patients is a valid option to treat 
     end-stage hallux rigidus.]

     angle), talonavicular coverage angle, and medial navicular pole 
     extrusion. Postoperative complications and incidence of midfoot pain 
     were evaluated at the last follow-up visit. Results: The reduction 
     group exhibited better clinical and radiological parameters, 
     including the TMT1dp and medial navicular pole extrusion, than the 
     malreduction group at the last follow-up (all P < .05). However, the 
     calcaneal pitch angle, lateral Meary's angle, Kite angle, and 
     talonavicular coverage angle did not significantly differ between the 
     two groups (all P > .05). The overall incidence of midfoot pain was 
     26.4%. The reduction group showed a lower incidence of medial pain 
     than the malreduction group (15.7% vs. 40.0%, P < .05). Regression 
     analysis revealed that midfoot abduction, represented by the TMT1dp, 
     was a critical factor for midfoot arthrodesis failure and that medial 
     navicular pole extrusion was not correlated with postoperative 
     midfoot pain. Conclusion: Midfoot reduction arthrodesis yields better 
     clinical outcomes than malreduction arthrodesis. The TMT1dp, 
     representing midfoot abduction, is a key factor for midfoot 
     arthrodesis failure. The extruded medial navicular bone may not 
     affect postoperative medial midfoot pain.]

     AB: Background: Fibula shortening can compromise ankle stability and 
     force transmission, thereby impacting clinical outcomes. Because 
     radiographs depict 3-dimensional anatomy in 2 dimensions, accurate 
     radiographic assessment of fibula length is a commonly encountered 
     clinical challenge. The talocrural angle (TCA), Shenton line, and 
     dime sign are useful parameters of fibula length. Yet, the impact of 
     3-dimensional limb positioning on these radiographic parameters is 
     not established. Methods: Bone models were constructed from CT scans 
     of 30 lower limbs. Fibula length was computationally manipulated, and 
     digitally reconstructed radiographs were generated reflecting 
     1-degree increments of sagittal and axial plane rotation of each limb 
     for each fibula length condition. The TCA was computationally 
     measured on each image. The presence of an aligned mortise view, 
     intact Shenton line, and intact dime sign was assessed by 2 
     observers. Results: The mean TCA, which was 78.0 (95% CI ± 1.6) 
     degrees for a true mortise projection with anatomic fibula length, 
     changed by approximately 1 degree per millimeter of fibula length 
     change. On average, 14.7 degrees of caudal rotation obscured 2 mm of 
     fibular shortening by virtue of producing the same TCA as a true 
     mortise view with anatomic fibula length, designated a false positive 
     view. Axial rotation had a comparatively small effect. Observers 1 
     and 2 were, respectively, 91% and 88% less likely to accurately judge 
     the image alignment of the false positive images compared to true 
     mortise images. Moreover, intraobserver agreement was poor to 
     moderate (mean 0.47, range 0.13-0.59) and interobserver agreement was 
     uniformly poor (mean 0.08, range 0.01-0.20). Conclusion: In our study 
     using digitally reconstructed radiographs from CT scans of 30 limbs, 
     we found that sagittal plane rotation impacts the radiographic 
     appearance of fibula length as measured by the TCA. Limb axial 
     rotation had a comparatively small effect. Further study of human 
     perception of Shenton line and dime sign is needed before the effect 
     of rotation on these parameters can be fully understood.]

     AB: Background: Glomus tumors are uncommon tumors and their 
     occurrence in the foot is even less common. Glomus tumors of the toes 
     are often missed, causing delays in diagnosis and treatment. We 
     report an ambispective observational study of glomus tumors of the 
     toes that were treated at our institution. Methods: We reviewed the 
     records of all the patients who underwent excision of toe glomus 
     tumors in our department from January 2010 to September 2022. The 
     follow-up data were collected from the outpatient records and by 
     telephonic interview. Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) 
     score, Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), and the Foot Function 
     Index (FFI) were collected. Results: Out of all the patients treated 
     for glomus tumors, we found that 7 patients had glomus tumors of the 
     toes. Of the 7 patients, 6 were women and 1 was a male. The mean 
     follow-up of our patients was 66.4 months (range, 7-109 months). Of 
     the 7 patients, 1 presented with recurrent glomus tumor 30 months 
     following the primary operation, for which she underwent excision 
     again, after which she was symptom free. Another patient who 
     developed recurrent symptoms on telephonic interview refused any 
     further treatment. Among the 6 patients who were symptom-free at 
     follow-up (including the patient who underwent excision for the 
     recurrent tumor), the median SANE score, and FFI were 99.5 (IQR, 
     96-100) and 0.5 (IQR, 0-2) respectively. The mean FAOS was 96 (SD, 
     3.3). Conclusion: Surgical excision of the subungual toe glomus 
     tumors can be curative. Recurrence of toe glomus tumors was noted in 
     2 patients (29%), one of whom refused further surgery. Re-excision in 
     the other patient resulted in complete resolution of symptoms]

     AB: Background: Flatfoot deformity is believed to play a role in 
     hallux valgus development and recurrence. While symptomatic flatfoot 
     deformity can be treated with separate procedures at the time of 
     hallux valgus correction, the question remains whether the patient 
     undergoing correction of a symptomatic hallux valgus deformity should 
     have their asymptomatic flatfoot concurrently addressed. We aimed to 
     investigate whether the presence of asymptomatic flatfoot influences 
     patient-reported and radiographic outcomes of the minimally invasive 
     chevron and Akin bunionectomy. Methods: A total of 104 patients were 
     included in this study. Forty-two asymptomatic patients met the 
     radiographic criteria for flatfoot while 62 had a normal arch. 
     Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated and compared between the two 
     groups using validated PROMIS measures preoperatively and at a 
     minimum one-year postoperatively. Radiographic outcomes including 
     hallux valgus angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle (IMA), Meary's 
     angle, calcaneal pitch (CP), and talonavicular coverage angle (TNCA) 
     were measured and compared preoperatively and minimum six-months 
     postoperatively. Results: Both groups demonstrated similar 
     preoperative and postoperative PROMIS scores with significant 
     improvements in physical function, pain interference, pain intensity, 
     and global physical health. Preoperatively, HVA was similar between 
     both groups, however the flatfoot group showed a greater IMA, Meary's 
     angle, TNCA, and lower CP. Postoperatively, HVA and IMA were similar 
     between groups, although patients in the flatfoot group retained a 
     significantly greater Meary's angle, TNCA, and lower CP. Both groups 
     showed significant improvements in HVA, IMA, and TNCA. Conclusion: 
     Our study indicates that the minimally invasive chevron and Akin 
     bunionectomy leads to improved clinical and radiographic hallux 
     valgus outcomes without adversely impacting radiographic flatfoot 
     parameters. Therefore, the MIS bunionectomy may be an effective 
     option for hallux valgus correction in patients with mild, 
     asymptomatic flatfoot.]

     MD: AB]
     AB: Background: With the advent of effective disease-modifying 
     medications, the surgical treatment of forefoot deformities in 
     patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has evolved from 
     joint-sacrificing to joint-preserving surgery. However, it is unclear 
     whether joint-preserving surgery is effective for the full range of 
     metatarsophalangeal joint involvement. Hence, this study investigated 
     the postoperative outcomes of joint-preserving surgery for rheumatoid 
     forefoot deformities with a wide range of joint destruction. Methods: 
     This retrospective observational study included 68 feet from 68 
     patients with RA who underwent joint-preserving surgery for forefoot 
     deformities between 2014 and 2020. The Larsen grade classification 
     was used to assess the first metatarsophalangeal joint destruction 
     and classify patients into 4 groups as follows: 0 and 1 (n = 14), 2 
     (n = 21), 3 (n = 19), and 4 and 5 (n = 14). The Self-Administered 
     Foot and Ankle Evaluation Questionnaire (SAFE-Q) score, hallux valgus 
     angle (HVA), and intermetatarsal angle (IMA) were determined before 
     surgery and at the last follow-up visit. Results: The median 
     observation duration was 40 (range, 24-78) months. SAFE-Q scores of 
     all groups significantly improved in all subscales at the last 
     observation, with no significant differences among the study groups. 
     Radiographic evaluations of all groups revealed significant 
     improvements in HVA and IMA after surgery, with no significant 
     differences among the groups. Conclusion: In patients using the 
     surgical approaches described in this study, joint-preserving surgery 
     for rheumatoid forefoot deformities led to satisfactory clinical and 
     radiographic improvements, regardless of the severity of joint 
     destruction.]

     AB: Background: Women continue to be underrepresented in orthopaedic 
     surgery. This study seeks to evaluate gender diversity of faculty and 
     trainees at foot and ankle surgery fellowship programs. Methods: In 
     this cross-sectional analysis of 49 US foot and ankle fellowship 
     programs, all publicly available data on program faculty (as of July 
     2023) were collected, as well as data on current and past fellows 
     between 2018 and 2024. Results: Of 49 programs with 195 foot and 
     ankle surgery faculty, 26.5% (n = 13) had at least 1 female on 
     faculty, with only 8.2% (n = 4) having female fellowship directors. 
     Female faculty made up 9.7% (n = 19) of foot and ankle surgery 
     faculty overall. Of 307 total fellows identified within the 6-year 
     period, 19.5% (n = 60) were female. Geographic distribution of 
     programs was as follows: 29% (n = 14) Northeast, 31% (n = 15) South, 
     19% (n = 9) Midwest, and 21% (n = 10) West. Northeast programs made 
     up 62% of all programs with female faculty, whereas Midwest programs 
     made up the least at 8% (P = .048). Programs with female faculty had 
     more female fellows from 2018 to 2024 than programs without female 
     faculty (33.7% vs 14%, P < .001). Conclusion: Our findings suggest 
     that females remain underrepresented in foot and ankle surgery 
     fellowship director positions, despite an increasing proportion of 
     females entering orthopaedic surgery. Foot and ankle surgery 
     fellowship programs with female faculty had a higher number of female 
     trainees; as such, diversification of foot and ankle fellowship 
     departments may be an important factor in ongoing efforts to promote 
     gender diversity within the specialty.]

     AB: Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the 
     biomechanical effect of medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy 
     (MDCO), subtalar joint fusion (SF), and medial ligament 
     reconstruction (MLR: deltoid-spring ligament) in a severe flatfoot 
     model. We hypothesized that (1) combination of MDCO and SF improves 
     the tibiotalar and foot alignment in severe progressive collapsing 
     foot deformity (PCFD) cadaver model. (2) However, if a residual 
     valgus heel alignment remains after MCDO and SF, it can lead to 
     increased medial ligament strain, foot malalignment, and tibiotalar 
     valgus tilt, which will be mitigated by the addition of MLR. Methods: 
     Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric foot specimens were used to create a 
     severe flatfoot model. The foot alignment changes, including the 
     talo-first metatarsal angle in the axial and sagittal planes, 
     subtalar angle, and tibiotalar angle in the coronal plane, were 
     measured. The angles were measured at the initial condition, after 
     creating the severe flatfoot model, and after each successive 
     reconstructive procedure in the following order: (1) MDCO, (2) SF, 
     and (3) MLR. Results: Tibiotalar valgus tilt was decreased with the 
     MDCO procedure: 4.4 vs 1.0 degrees (P = .04). Adding in situ SF to 
     the MDCO led to increased tibiotalar tilt to 2.5 degrees was 
     different from the initial condition (P = .01). Although the 
     tibiotalar valgus tilt was significantly decreased after adding the 
     MLR to the MDCO/SF procedure compared with the severe flatfoot model 
     (0.8 vs 4.4 degrees, P = .03), no significant difference in the 
     tibiotalar valgus tilt was observed between MDCO/SF and MDCO/SF with 
     MLR. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that MDCO significantly 
     improved forefoot abduction and medial arch alignment, with no 
     significant additional improvement observed with addition of SF. 
     Following SF, a residual valgus heel alignment can contribute to 
     subsequent tibiotalar valgus tilt. The addition of MLR did not show 
     significantly decreased tibiotalar valgus tilt following SF. Clinical 
     Relevance: Residual valgus heel alignment after subtalar joint fusion 
     in the surgical treatment of PCFD can lead to increased medial 
     ligament strain. Although MLR might be considered for providing 
     medial stability, it may not necessarily prevent the development of 
     tibiotalar valgus tilt.]

     AB: Data on the mechanism of kinesiology taping (KT) for providing

     increasing functionality in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) 
     have been contradictory, with no study evaluating acute muscle 
     activation. Our aim in this study was to determine the acute effect 
     of KT applied to the rectus femoris muscle on this muscle's 
     activation, functionality and proprioception in patients with knee 
     osteoarthritis. We divided 40 individuals diagnosed with knee 
     osteoarthritis into two groups: (a) KT group (taping with tension 
     facilitation) and (b) a placebo group (taping with no tension 
     facilitation). We applied taping to the participants' left and right 
     side rectus femoris muscles for 30 minutes, but with muscle 
     facilitation in the KT group and without tension in the placebo 
     group. We assessed participants for muscle activation with surface 
     electromyography (sEMG), for functionality with the Timed Up and Go 
     Test (TUG), and for proprioception/joint sense with the Five Times 
     Sit-to-Stand Test (5TSTS) before and after taping. Demographic and 
     clinical characteristics of the groups before these interventions 
     were similar (p > .05). Muscle activation did not change 
     significantly in either group compared to before taping (p > .05), 
     but there were improvements in both knees for proprioception/joint 
     sense (p < .05). Both groups were similar in terms of functionality 
     (5TSTS, TUG) results (p > .05). We concluded that KT applied 
     bilaterally to the rectus femoris did not affect rectus femoris 
     muscle activation and functionality in patients with knee OA, but it 
     did improve proprioception.]

     AB: Stroke is a significant health problem that may result in 
     long-term functional deficits. Balance and walking problems are among 
     the most common post-stroke deficits, and they may negatively affect 
     quality of life. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects 
     of cervical mobilization on balance and gait parameters after stroke. 
     Participants were 24 adults (aged 30-65 years), who scored 24 or 
     above on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and no more 
     than 3 on the Modified Rankin scale. Participants were randomly 
     assigned to either an experimental Bobath therapy and cervical 
     mobilization group (n = 12) or a control group who received Bobath 
     therapy and a sham application (n = 12). Both groups received 60 
     minutes of Bobath therapy three times a week for four weeks; 
     additionally, the experimental group received 15 minutes of cervical 
     mobilization in each session, while the control group received 15 
     minutes of spinal sham mobilization each session. Pre and post 
     treatment, we assessed all participants' demographic characteristics, 
     gait parameters, balance parameters, and forward head posture values 
     using a clinical data assessment form, spatiotemporal gait analysis 
     (LEGSystm), portable computerized kinesthetic balance device 
     (SportKAT 550), and craniovertebral angle (CVA), respectively. The 
     groups showed no significant differences in their initial demographic 
     and clinical characteristics (age, sex, stroke duration and 
     disability levels.). In comparing changes on variables of interest, 
     we observed significant experimental versus control group 
     improvements in balance parameters except for their left side balance 
     score (right side, left side, forward, backward and total balance 
     scores were significant at p = .003, p = .089, p < .001, p = .022, p 
     < .001, respectively), gait parameters (stride number, stride length, 
     stride time, stride velocity, cadance at p = .007, p = .019, p = 
     .013, p = .005, p = .001, respectively) and CVA (p < .001). Also, 
     there were findings in favor of the experimental group on the 
     modified timed up and go test on walk out, mid turn, walk back and 
     total times (p = .028, p = .001, p = .016, and p = .001, 
     respectively),but not for sit-to-stand time or stand-to-sit time. 
     Clinicians involved in stroke rehabilitation should assess and treat 
     the cervical region to enhance rehabilitation effectiveness.]

     AB: We investigated whether mood and lifestyle-related indicators of 
     physical health are differentially expressed according to 
     self-reported levels of depressive symptoms among young adults with a 
     current episode of major depression. In a cross-sectional study, we 
     recruited 94 young adults (females = 67, 71.3%; males = 27, 28.7%; 
     aged 18-35 years) with a current episode of major depression. We 
     assessed their mood with the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Beck 
     Anxiety Inventory-(BAI), sleep with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
     Index (PSQI), physical activity with the Simple Physical Activity 
     Questionnaire (SIMPAQ), and their cardiorespiratory fitness. 
     Participants' depression levels were classified as follows using 
     established cut-points: (a) Mild Depressive Symptoms (MIDS, BDI-II 
     14-19 points, n = 17), (b) Moderate Depressive Symptoms (MODS, BDI-II 
     20-28 points, n = 37) or (c) Severe Depressive Symptoms (SEDS, BDI-II 
     29-63 points, n = 40). As expected, we found that young adults with 
     SEDS, when compared to those with MODS and MIDS, showed higher 
     depressive mood on the POMS, and they exhibited greater anxiety 
     symptoms, lower reported 'vigor' on physical activity measures, worse 
     sleep quality as expressed by their global score sleep; daytime 
     dysfunction; and sleep disturbance, and they showed lower 
     cardiorespiratory fitness. Those with moderate depressive symptoms 
     only differed from those with mild symptoms with respect to 
     hostility, fatigue and mood disturbance. Although there was a 
     gradient whereby worse mental and physical health indicators were 
     more closely related to the SEDS depression categorization, while 
     healthier indicators were associated with the MIDS category, some 
     parameters were not different between the MDD severity groups,

     AB: Traditional Chinese exercises (TCEs) have great value in the 
     prevention and effective treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). 
     Our purpose in this study was to summarize present research trends 
     and future directions regarding the link between TCEs and CVD by 
     bibliometrics analysis. We searched the Web of Science Core 
     Collection (WoSCC) for all original articles and reviews on TCEs for 
     CVD published in English before August 7, 2022 using CiteSpace 5.8.R3 
     and Microsoft Excel 2019 software, and we displayed the results in 
     the form of network maps, line graphs, and tables. We initially 
     obtained 725 articles. Our results showed that the United States was 
     the most influential country in this line of research, with Harvard 
     University the most prolific institution in the field, and, 
     Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine was the most 
     productive journal for these articles. The highest-frequency keywords 
     in this research area were Tai Chi, exercise, blood pressure, quality 
     of life, and older adult. Additionally, important research topics 
     included heart rate variability, quality of life, meta-analysis, 
     Baduanjin exercise, and breathing exercise. In addition, our results 
     revealed that among all the TCEs, Tai Chi, Baduanjin, and Qigong 
     emerged as the most extensively studied. However, it's important to 
     note our exclusive focus on literature published in English may have 
     led to our missing important results. Future investigators should 
     broaden their search to include other databases and languages to 
     present a still more comprehensive overview of this field.]

     AB: Functional changes are essential determinants of mortality and 
     morbidity in individuals with chronic liver disease. However, there 
     is limited information about whether these changes persist long-term 
     after liver transplantation (LT). We aimed to compare physical 
     fitness, physical activity, balance, kinesiophobia, and fatigue 
     between patients with LT and healthy controls. All participants 
     underwent evaluation with the Senior Fitness Test (SFT) for exercise 
     capacity and physical fitness, the International Physical Activity 
     Questionnaire (IPAQ) for physical activity, the Timed Up-and-Go Test 
     (TUG) and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) for balance, the Tampa Scale 
     for Kinesiophobia (TSK) for kinesiophobia, and the Fatigue Severity 
     Scale (FSS) and Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) for fatigue. We studied 16 
     persons with LT (M age = 40.56, SD = 15.73 years; M time since LT = 
     66.81, SD = 72.05 months) and 16 control participants (M age = 39.87, 
     SD = 13.98 years). Compared to controls, participants with LT showed 
     significantly poorer performance on the SFT components assessing 
     upper and lower body strength, aerobic endurance, agility, and 
     dynamic balance (p < .001 for all), significantly lower IPAQ physical 
     activity scores (p = .002) and BBS score (p = .017), and 
     significantly higher TUG time (p < .001) and TSK, FSS, and FIS scores 
     (p = .001, p = .001, and p = .004, respectively). Individuals with 
     post-LT had lower exercise capacity, physical fitness, balance, and 
     physical activity, and higher kinesiophobia and fatigue levels in the 
     long-term compared to their peers. Future studies should focus on 
     frailty in individuals in the long term after LT.]

     AB: There are conflicting reports of the level of physical activity 
     (PA) and its relationship to quality of life (QoL) among caregivers 
     of children with physical disabilities (CwPD). In this 
     cross-sectional study, we aimed to compare the PA levels and QoL of 
     two groups of caregivers - a CwPD group and caregivers of typically 
     developing children (CwTD). We included 32 family caregivers in the 
     CwPD group (22 women, 10 men; M age = 42.1, SD = 6.2 years) and 32 
     caregivers in the CwTD group (24 women, 8 men; M age = 42.3, SD = 6.1 
     years). We assessed PA with the International Physical Activity 
     Scale-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and self-reported activity diaries, and we 
     assessed QoL with the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Although 
     the IPAQ scores and sitting times of caregivers in these two groups 
     were not statistically different (p > .05), many parameters of 
     self-reported activity diary data and total energy expenditure were 
     significantly higher in the CwPD than the CwTD group (p < .05, effect 
     size = .53-1.10). The CwPD group reported a lower QoL according to 
     the SF-36 and its sub-scores (p < .05, effect size = .54-.77), and 
     higher PA levels than those in the CwTD group. In the CwPD group, 
     moderate, vigorous, and total PA scores were mildly to moderately 
     associated with the total Qol score, and many of its subscores (r = 
     .36 to .60, p < .05). The lower quality of life observed in CwPD, 
     despite high-intensity physical activity levels, suggested that 
     investigators and care providers should consider QoL in the CwPD 
     group to be multifactorial and that here is a need for caregiver 
     interventions to enhance QoL in this underserved population.]

     AB: Our purpose in the present study was to examine whether moving 
     tactile stimuli to the sole to mimic moving weight distribution over 
     the feet during gait would influence body sway in quiet stance. 
     Fifteen healthy males maintained the quiet stance, and we delivered 
     moving tactile stimuli to mimic the change in their weight 
     distribution during gait. Moving tactile stimuli did not change the 
     length of the center of pressure (COP) displacement and COP position. 
     Vision decreased the length of the COP, but it did not interact with 
     moving tactile stimuli for the COP length and position. The COP 
     position rhythmically moved in the medial-lateral axis along with the 
     cycle of moving tactile stimuli. The COP was at the lateral peak 
     position at the period at which moving tactile stimuli mimicked the 
     weight distribution in the transition between the swing and stance 
     phases of the gait cycle. This finding may indicate that the body is 
     positioned at the lateral peak position in quiet stance when people 
     perceive the sensation of weight distribution over the feet at the 
     most unstable phase of the gait cycle. We suggest that moving tactile 
     stimuli to the sole may induce medial-lateral body sway before gait 
     initiation for patients with Parkinson's disease to improve their 
     freezing of gait initiation.]

     presence of kinesiophobia and its relationship with clinical outcomes 
     among 42 patients with MI who completed the Tampa Scale of 
     Kinesiophobia Swedish Version for Heart (TSK-SV Heart) the 
     International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), 
     the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
     Scale (HADS), the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea 
     Scale, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and the MacNew Heart 
     Disease Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire. The 
     participants' mean TSK-SV Heart score was 39.24 (SD = 6.65), and 
     71.4% of these patients reported a high level of kinesiophobia. The 
     TSK-SV Heart score demonstrated a strong correlation with the 
     IPAQ-SF, 6MWT walking distance, and mMRC score (p < .001), and a 
     moderate correlation with the HADS, CCI, and MacNew Heart Disease 
     HRQoL (p < .05). Patients with a high level of kinesiophobia had 
     lower IPAQ-SF, 6MWT walking distance, and HRQoL and higher mMRC, CCI, 
     and HADS scores than patients with low levels of kinesiophobia (p < 
     .05). Kinesiophobia was common and represented a considerable risk 
     factor for physical-psychosocial dysfunctions in these patients with 
     MI. To maintain functional independence and to increase physical 
     activity level, clinicians should consider kinesiophobia from early 
     to late-stage disease and should add a treatment focus that seeks to 
     eliminate kinesiophobia in cardiac rehabilitation programs.]

     AB: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) must often cope with a high 
     level of stress. Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) stress-appraisal-coping 
     theory described the importance of stress appraisals to determine 
     which behavioral responses and coping strategies an individual draws 
     upon following stressful events. One of the most highly validated 
     stress appraisal measures is the Stress Appraisal Measure (SAM; 
     Peacock and Wong, 1990), which was primarily developed as a 
     dispositional measure, SAM-Revised (SAM-R: Roesch and Rowley, 2005). 
     However, it has not been validated in adults with MS. The purpose of 
     this study was to confirm the measurement structure and psychometric 
     properties of the SAM-R with a sample of adults with MS. A 
     confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the factor 
     structure of SAM-R in 477 adults with MS. CFA confirmed the 
     three-factor structure: χ2/df = 3.94 (less than 5), comparative fit 
     index = .95 (higher than .90), root mean square error of 
     approximation = 0.079 (90% confidence interval [0.070, 0.087]; less 
     than .08), and the standardized root mean square residual = .046 
     (less than .08). The three factors include (a) challenge appraisal, 
     (b) threat appraisal, and (c) centrality appraisal. Correlations 
     among these three factors and external measures of related concepts 
     provided evidence of the validity of these factors. The SAM-R is a 
     psychometrically validated measure that can be incorporated in 
     rehabilitation counseling, mental health, and healthcare settings to 
     assess the stress appraisal style. Rehabilitation and health 
     professionals can use it to evaluate the effectiveness of 
     psychosocial interventions in helping people with MS to manage 
     stressful life events and improve their mental health.]

     AB: Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, 
     systemic condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract. IBD can be 
     severe and are associated with impairment in growth, school absences, 
     abdominal pain, and fatigue. Physical activity (PA) could have an 
     anti-inflammatory effect in addition to other benefits. It is 
     important to address the possible risks, physiological effects of PA, 
     and potential barriers, and facilitators for PA participation in 
     pediatric IBD. However, potential barriers and facilitators to PA 
     have yet to be adequately described. Methods: We conducted a scoping 
     review to map and describe the current literature on PA in pediatric 
     IBD populations between 1980 and April 2022 using Preferred Reporting 
     Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines for Scoping 
     reviews. Results: Nineteen articles were identified including 10 
     descriptive, 6 interventional, and 3 physiological responses to PA 
     studies. Patients and healthy controls demonstrated similar responses 
     to exercise. Barriers to participation were low self-esteem, body 
     image, and active IBD symptoms. Facilitators included personal 
     interest, activity with friends, and support from family. Conclusion: 
     This review highlighted that PA participation may reduce in children 
     with IBD-related symptoms. Short- and medium-term impacts of PA on 
     immune modulation require further study; it is possible that regular 
     PA does not negatively affect biomarkers of disease activity.]

     evolving from a research tool to a promising in silico tool to assist 
     medical doctors and physical therapists in decision making by 
     providing parameters relating to dynamic MSK function and loading. 
     This review primarily focuses on our own and related work to 
     illustrate the framework and the interpretation of MSK model-based 
     parameters in patients with 3 different conditions, that is, 
     degenerative joint disease, cerebral palsy, and adult spinal

     different simulation frameworks introducing in silico model-based 
     biomarkers of motor function to inform MSK rehabilitation and 
     treatment, with the application for adult spinal deformities being 
     the most recent of the 3. Based on these applications, barriers to 
     clinical integration and positioning of these in silico technologies 
     within standard clinical practice are discussed in the light of

     AB: Lower limb exoskeletons and exosuits ("exos") are traditionally 
     designed with a strong focus on mechatronics and actuation, whereas 
     the "human side" is often disregarded or minimally modeled. Muscle 
     biomechanics principles and skeletal muscle response to 
     robot-delivered loads should be incorporated in design/control of 
     exos. In this narrative review, we summarize the advances in

     lower limb exoskeletons. We report methods to measure muscle 
     biomechanics directly and indirectly and summarize the studies that 
     have incorporated muscle measures for improved design and control of 
     intuitive lower limb exos. Finally, we delve into articles that have 
     studied how the human-exo interaction influences muscle biomechanics 
     during locomotion. To support neurorehabilitation and facilitate 
     everyday use of wearable assistive technologies, we believe that 
     future studies should investigate and predict how exoskeleton 
     assistance strategies would structurally remodel skeletal muscle over 
     time. Real-time mapping of the neuromechanical origin and generation 
     of muscle force resulting in joint torques should be combined with 
     musculoskeletal models to address time-varying parameters such as 
     adaptation to exos and fatigue. Development of smarter predictive 
     controllers that steer rather than assist biological components could 
     result in a synchronized human-machine system that optimizes the 
     biological and electromechanical performance of the combined system.]

     AB: Spasticity is a common impairment within pediatric 
     neuromusculoskeletal disorders. How spasticity contributes to gait 
     deviations is important for treatment selection. Our aim was to 
     evaluate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying gait deviations 
     seen in children with spasticity, using predictive simulations. A 
     cluster analysis was performed to extract distinct gait patterns from 
     experimental gait data of 17 children with spasticity to be used as 
     comparative validation data. A forward dynamic simulation framework 
     was employed to predict gait with either velocity- or force-based 
     hyperreflexia. This framework entailed a generic musculoskeletal 
     model controlled by reflexes and supraspinal drive, governed by a 
     multiobjective cost function. Hyperreflexia values were optimized to 
     enable the simulated gait to best match experimental gait patterns. 
     Three experimental gait patterns were extracted: (1) increased knee 
     flexion, (2) increased ankle plantar flexion, and (3) increased knee 
     flexion and ankle plantar flexion when compared with typical gait. 
     Overall, velocity-based hyperreflexia outperformed force-based 
     hyperreflexia. The first gait pattern could mostly be explained by 
     rectus femoris and hamstrings velocity-based hyperreflexia, the 
     second by gastrocnemius velocity-based hyperreflexia, and the third 
     by gastrocnemius, soleus, and hamstrings velocity-based 
     hyperreflexia. This study shows how velocity-based hyperreflexia from 
     specific muscles contributes to different spastic gait patterns, 
     which may help in providing targeted treatment.]

     AB: Insomnia treatment among individuals with comorbid insomnia and 
     obstructive sleep apnea is suboptimal. In a pilot randomized 
     controlled trial, 19 individuals with comorbid insomnia and 
     obstructive sleep apnea were allocated to one of two arms: EX + EX, 
     consisting of two 8-week phases of exercise training (EX), or RE + 
     CBTiEX, encompassing 8 weeks of relaxation training (RE) followed by 
     8 weeks of combined cognitive-behavioral therapy and exercise 
     (CBTiEX). Outcomes included Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), 
     polysomnography, and cardiorespiratory fitness measures. A 
     mixed-model analysis of variance revealed a Group × Time interaction 
     on peak oxygen consumption change, F(1, 14) = 10.1, p = .007, and EX 
     increased peak oxygen consumption (p = .03, g′ = −0.41) and 
     reduced ISI (p = .001, g′ = 0.82) compared with RE (p = .49, g = 
     0.16) post-8 weeks. Post-16 weeks, there was a significant Group × 
     Time interaction (p = .014) driven by RE + CBTiEX yielding a larger 
     improvement in ISI (p = .023, g′ = 1.48) than EX + EX (p = .88, 
     g′ < 0.1). Objective sleep was unchanged. This study showed 
     promising effects of regular EX alone and combined with

     AB: Gait analysis is one of the highly focused research areas 
     inviting attention of academicians and practitioners. Being a 
     prominent analytical tool to detect the abnormalities and onset of 
     musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), abundant literature is published in 
     this area. Though a large number of gait analysis methods (GMSs) for 
     motion analysis are available in the literature, very few studies are 
     available to showcase the comparative analysis and applicability of 
     various techniques. This study seeks to provide useful recapitulation 
     of various gait measurement methods and interrogates the relative 
     prevalence of various GMS based on the applications by various 
     researchers. The paper summarizes the findings of a systematic review 
     on gait measurement methods carried out using the preferred reporting 
     items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology. 
     Fifty-three research papers published during 1998-2021 were included 
     for critical review. The categories of gait measure ment systems were 
     further compared based on certain criteria such as portability, cost, 
     and accuracy, and ranked using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The 
     review helped to encapsulate various aspects of gait analysis, 
     especially, the types of tasks, types of gait parameters (GPs), and 
     the gait measurement systems adopted. The study provides suitable 
     mappings between these factors and offers comparison between the gait 
     measurement systems using a specially devised capability index. It 
     further provides useful guidelines for selecting the gait systems 
     based on the criteria.]

     AB: A foot posture index (FPI-6) measurement is well presented as a 
     straightforward clinical tool for diagnosing foot posture in 
     patients. However, the FPI-6 diagnosis is mostly performed by a 
     medical practitioner manually utilizing both palpation and rulers. 
     Digital photos of the feet had been considered to digitize the FPI-6 
     assessment, unfortunately, the two-dimensional image is inadequate to 
     identify two-palpation based on six criteria of FPI-6. This paper 
     proposes a mechanical platform design for generating a 
     three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's foot. The design is 
     aimed to ease the test process of a large number of samples or 
     participants as statistical data to estimate the foot posture based 
     on the FPI-6 method. The 3D-generated models of the foot belonging to 
     37 children aged below 12 years old show that the FPI-6 Criteria 1 
     and 4 can be evaluated more clearly in the 3D models compared with 
     flat 2D photos.]

     Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and 
     integrate Mind-body Activation strategies into the holistic 
     rehabilitation and supportive treatment of elderly patients with 
     post-stroke hemiparesis. The aim was to assess the potential of 
     promoting overall recovery in elderly stroke patients and explore a 
     novel approach to stroke rehabilitation that emphasizes the 
     integration of mind and body. A total of 103 elderly patients with 
     post-stroke hemiplegia receiving rehabilitation treatment were 
     selected and randomly assigned to the control group and experimental 
     group. In the control group, 52 patients received intervention with 
     routine rehabilitation exercise training, while in the experimental 
     group, 51 patients adopted the Mind-body Activation strategy combined 
     with routine rehabilitation exercise training to achieve physical and 
     mental integration through techniques such as warm-up exercises and 
     music therapy. Both groups were evaluated before and after the 
     intervention in terms of walking function, balance function, daily 
     living ability, and cognitive ability. The results showed that after 
     the intervention for 3 months, the Holden walking functional grading, 
     Berg scale score, Barthel scale score and MMSE score of patients in 
     both groups were significantly higher than those before the 
     intervention (P<0.05). Additionally, the above four indicators of 
     patients in the experimental group were significantly higher than 
     those in the control group (P<0.05). The Mind-body Activation 
     strategy incorporated into routine rehabilitation exercise training 
     can effectively enhance the walking function, balance function, daily 
     living ability and cognitive ability of elderly stroke patients with 
     hemiplegia. The Mind-body Activation strategy is a feasible and 
     effective new rehabilitation method of hemiplegia after stroke, which 
     is conducive to promoting the comprehensive rehabilitation of elderly 
     stroke patients.]

     AB: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) forms the cornerstone in the 
     treatment of advanced prostate cancer. However, by suppressing 
     testosterone ADT results in a decrease of skeletal muscle mass. In

     ADT-induced muscle mass loss and the consequences for muscle strength 
     and physical performance. Subsequently, we elucidate the 
     effectiveness of supervised resistance exercise training as a means 
     to mitigate these adverse effects. Literature shows that resistance 
     exercise training can effectively counteract ADT-induced loss of 
     appendicular lean body mass and decline in muscle strength, while the 
     effect on physical performances is inconclusive. As resistance 
     exercise training is feasible and can be safely implemented during 
     ADT (with special attention for patients with bone metastases), it 
     should be incorporated in standard clinical care for prostate cancer 
     patients (starting) with ADT.]

     AB: Background: Women with higher body mass index report low rates of 
     and face unique barriers to exercise. Increasing exercise 
     participation can improve mental and physical health independent of 
     weight loss; however, most exercise programs targeting this 
     population focus predominately on losing weight. This paper aims to 
     describe the development of Fit&Fab, a community-based exercise 
     intervention focused on increasing exercise participation and 
     enjoyment for women with obesity. Methods: In partnership with the 
     YMCA, we recruited women ages 35-64 years (body mass index ≥ 30) to 
     participate in 4 focus groups to understand exercise preferences. 
     Formative work was used to identify theory constructs and associated 
     intervention components. Women from the focus groups were recruited 
     for a community advisory board that finalized the intervention 
     design, recruitment, and evaluation plan. Results: Focus groups 
     participants (N = 29) preferred to exercise without men and wanted a 
     cohort-style class that included women of similar exercise levels and 
     body types, incorporated social support, fun activities, and broke 
     exercise into smaller bouts. They wanted a supportive instructor who 
     was fit but understood weight-related challenges. The community 
     advisory board and research team used focus group findings to inform 
     design of the final intervention including group exercise classes, 
     psychosocial support sessions, personalized training, exercise 
     tracking, outcome monitoring, and rewards. Conclusions: Our findings 
     emphasize the need to focus on exercise enjoyment and benefits other 
     than losing weight to improve exercise participation among women with 
     higher body mass index. In addition to having outcomes other than 
     weight loss, exercise interventions with this population should also 
     consider group composition, instructor, and class format.]

     AB: Pain management constitutes a pivotal aspect of palliative care. 
     Certain instances of distressing pain are significantly relieved 
     through interventional pain methodologies, demanding the expertise of 
     pain specialists. Our perspective revolves around the integration of 
     these 2 facets, envisaging a symbiotic relationship that could 
     enhance patient outcomes. A prospective assessment was carried out 
     within a collaborative clinic, uniting the realms of pain management 
     and palliative medicine. Anonymized patient information was 
     scrutinized to grasp the advantages of this amalgamation and identify 
     strategies to address any inherent deficiencies. Furthermore, an 
     illustrative case study was delineated, spotlighting the 
     collaborative dynamics at a systemic level. During the period 
     spanning from November 2020 to June 2021, a total of 43 patients 
     received consultations at this collaborative clinic. Each patient was 
     exposed to a comprehensive pain management regimen, with the most 
     frequently conducted procedure being an intercostal nerve block, 
     which was administered in 9.30% of cases. For the provision of 
     effective pain relief within the palliative care context, the 
     confluence of joint consultations from cancer pain specialists 
     emerges as a requisite measure. This approach carries the promise of 
     optimizing pain control and augmenting the quality of palliative 
     care.]

     EQ-5D-5L, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and 
     Single-Item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month 
     follow-ups from baseline. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
     Events v.4.0 was used for adverse event (AE) analysis. Statistical 
     significance was defined as p < 0.050. Seventy-seven patients met 
     inclusion criteria. CBMP initiation correlated with BPI pain severity 
     (p = 0.004), pain interference (p = 0.005), and MPQ2 (p = 0.017) 
     improvements at all follow-ups compared to baseline. There were

     participants (22.08%) recorded 76 mild AEs (34.86%), 104 moderate AEs 
     (47.71%), and 38 severe AEs (17.43%). Though causality cannot be 
     assumed in this observational study, results support development of 
     randomized control trials for osteoarthritis pain management with

     (opioid dose reduction, opioid switching, and others: n = 14, 3, and 
     4, respectively). Myoclonus is a common complication in patients with

     AB: Cancer-related pain (CrP) is a significant public health problem, 
     and opioids are the mainstay of CrP treatment. Considering the 
     persistent problem of inadequate treatment of cancer pain in Turkey, 
     the study was conducted to determine the prevalence of reluctance to 
     prescribe opioids among physicians in oncology departments. The 
     descriptive cross-sectional study included oncology residents and 
     residents without oncology specialization in oncology departments. 
     One thousand physicians were invited by e-mail to the Google Forms 
     survey platform. Two hundred and seventy-eight physicians completed 
     the survey and were included, of which 50% (n: 139) were female. More 
     than half (n: 166; 59.7%) of them were oncology subspecialists. The 
     prevalence of reluctance to prescribe opioids was calculated to be 
     38.1% (n: 106). A significant positive association was found between 
     the factor associated with reluctance to prescribe opioids and fear 
     of opioid use disorder (β = 0.964; 95% CI = 0.362-1.566; p = .002). 
     Reluctance to prescribe opioids was inversely related to the oncology 
     subspecialty (β = −0.878; 95% CI = −1.54 to −0.213; p = 0.010) 
     and education about CrP and opioid management (β = −1.707; 95% CI 
     = −2.404 to −1.009; p = 0.01). Reluctance to prescribe opioids 
     appears to be associated with a lack of knowledge and fear of opioid 
     use disorder.]

     AB: The Commercially Insured health Plan Risk Index for Overdose or 
     Serious Opioid-induced Respiratory Depression (CIP-RIOSORD) is an 
     evidence-based tool to determine serious opioid-induced respiratory 
     depression (OIRD) or overdose risk. The CIP-RIOSORD total score 
     determines a risk class and estimates the probability for an OIRD 
     event within the next 6 months. We performed a single-center, 
     retrospective analysis to determine CIP-RIOSORD baseline scores and 
     the most common predictive factors in patients with cancer. Patients 
     (n = 160) were split into new consultations (n = 83, Group 1) versus 
     the first documented follow-up consultation (n = 77, Group 2). Most 
     patients were Caucasian women with metastatic gastrointestinal 
     cancer. CIP-RIOSORD scores for Group 1 patients were 14.8 ± 15.2 
     (mean ± SD, risk class 4). Group 2 patients had higher CIP-RIOSORD 
     scores (16.6 ± 14.9, risk class 4). For Group 1, the most common 
     CIP-RIOSORD predictive factors were use of a long-acting opioid 
     formulation (n = 24, 29%) and daily oral morphine equivalent (OME) 
     ≥100 (n = 20, 24%); for Group 2, predictive factors were use of an 
     antidepressant (n = 34, 44%) and a long-acting opioid formulation (n 
     = 27, 35%). Based on the CIP-RIOSORD, there is a 15% probability of 
     experiencing a serious OIRD event or overdose within the next 6 
     months.]

     offer potential benefit in specialty palliative care via decreasing 
     sympathetic output, inducing sedation, and modulating pain. 
     Especially in clinical contexts where agitation predominates and

     medication delivery is advantageous. We report a case of agitated 
     behaviors in setting of mixed Alzheimer/vascular-type dementia 
     limiting hospital discharge to nursing facility that were ameliorated

     routinely conceptualize the seemingly disparate alpha-2 agonists as a 
     class for effective symptom palliation especially as new clinical 
     evidence becomes available.]

     AB: This report describes the use of subcutaneous lidocaine infusion 
     to manage complex pain associated with checkpoint inhibitor 
     inflammatory arthritis. In addition, the safe administration of 
     lidocaine in the home setting is described. A 49-year-old man with 
     metastatic melanoma to lung, right axilla and posterior chest wall on 
     regular pembrolizumab developed checkpoint inhibitor inflammatory 
     arthritis. Pain associated with this was unresponsive to simple 
     analgesia, escalating opioids and adjuvant analgesics. Lidocaine 
     infusion was used on separate occasions (inpatient unit and home 
     setting) to gain rapid and sustained control of inflammatory pain. 
     Inflammatory pain responded well to 2 mg/kg/h lidocaine infusion over 
     4 days with sustained response between infusions of up to 6 wk. 
     Resulting in improved mobility, functional status, and overall 
     quality of life. Lidocaine infusion should be considered as an option 
     for analgesic management of checkpoint inhibitor inflammatory 
     arthritis in patients for whom usual treatment is ineffective, and as 
     an opioid-sparing intervention.]

     AB: While morphine is the recommended first-line treatment for pain 
     management in patients with acute coronary syndrome, recent studies 
     have raised concerns about its association with adverse outcomes. 
     Morphine has been found to cause delayed antiplatelet effects, 
     decreased ticagrelor absorption, increased platelet reactivity, and 
     compromised efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Alternative 
     analgesics, such as lidocaine, fentanyl, and acetaminophen, have 
     begun to emerge as viable alternatives, each with unique mechanisms 
     and potential benefits. Lidocaine is demonstrated to have superior 
     effects in reducing microvascular obstruction and fewer adverse 
     events compared to fentanyl, despite being less effective in pain 
     reduction. Fentanyl, which shows rapid onset and powerful analgesic 
     properties, may interfere with ticagrelor absorption, potentially 
     affecting platelet inhibition. Acetaminophen, a centrally acting 
     analgesic, emerges as a safer alternative with comparable pain relief 
     efficacy and minimal side effects. The results of multiple clinical 
     trials emphasize the significance of customizing pain management 
     approaches to match individual patient profiles and achieving the 
     optimal balance between pain relief and potential adverse outcomes.]

     However, Nepal still faces significant challenges in accessing 
     primary palliative care services, including required medications, 
     particularly in rural areas. This commentary highlights the need for 
     policies and guidelines to ensure equitable access to palliative care 
     with medicines. While limited studies in Nepal confirmed the demand, 
     challenges persist in rural areas with deficient access to quality 
     healthcare. This article discusses the existing efforts and 
     noteworthy initiatives implemented by healthcare institutions. 
     However, these efforts are currently limited in scale. We recommend 
     including essential palliative care medicines in government 
     healthcare policies, establishing training programs for healthcare 
     professionals, and developing comprehensive policies with detailed 
     field research work to meet the growing demand. Addressing these 
     issues will significantly improve the quality of life for palliative 
     care patients in Nepal.]

     AB: Methocarbamol is an antispasmodic muscle relaxant and was the 
     fourth most-prescribed muscle relaxant by volume in the United States 
     in 2021. Intravenous (IV) methocarbamol contains the excipient, 
     polyethylene glycol (PEG), which has been implicated in metabolic 
     acidosis and nephrotoxicity. Intravenous methocarbamol was first 
     approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1959 and at that 
     time the IV methocarbamol prescribing information warned of 
     PEG-associated adverse drug events in patients living with renal 
     impairment; however, the manufacturer acknowledged data were lacking 
     to objectively support this claim. Clinicians prescribing and 
     dispensing IV methocarbamol may encounter the warning for 
     PEG-associated metabolic acidosis and nephrotoxicity without knowing 
     the potential risks, or lack thereof, supporting or disavowing this 
     phenomenon. This commentary debates the merits supporting and 
     arguments refuting PEG-associated metabolic acidosis and 
     nephrotoxicity in patients treated with IV methocarbamol.]

     AB: Context: Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) 
     demonstrate reduced spinal reflex modulation and corticospinal 
     excitability of the soleus, which may contribute to decreased balance 
     performance. Objective: To determine the effects of a single session 
     of balance training on Spinal-reflexive excitability modulation and 
     corticospinal excitability in those with CAI. Design: Randomized 
     controlled trials. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: Thirty 
     participants with CAI were randomly assigned to the balance training 
     (BAL) or control (CON) group. Main Outcome Measures: Modulation of 
     soleus spinal-reflexive excitability was measured by calculating 
     relative change in normalized Hoffmann reflexes (ratio of the 
     H-reflex to the M-wave) from prone to single-leg standing. 
     Corticospinal excitability was assessed during single-leg stance 
     using transcranial magnetic stimulation, outcomes of which included 
     active motor threshold (AMT), motor evoked potential, and cortical 
     silent period (CSP). Balance performance was measured with center of 
     pressure velocity in anterior to posterior and medial to lateral 
     directions. Separate 2 × 2 repeated-measures analyses of variance 
     were employed to determine the effect of group (BAL and CON) and time 
     (baseline and posttraining) on each dependent variable. Results: 
     There were significant group by time interactions in the modulation 
     of soleus spinal-reflexive excitability (F1,27 = 4.763, P = .04); CSP 
     at 100% AMT (F1,27 = 4.727, P = .04); and CSP at 120% AMT (F1,27 = 
     16.057, P < .01). A large effect size suggests increased modulation 
     of spinal-reflexive excitability (d = 0.81 [0.03 to 1.54]) of the 
     soleus in BAL compared with CON at posttest, while CSP at 100% (d = 
     0.95 [0.17 to 1.70]) and 120% AMT (d = 1.10 [0.29 to 1.84]) was 
     reduced in BAL when compared with CON at posttest. Conclusion: After 
     a single session of balance training, individuals with CAI initiated 
     increases in spinal reflex modulation and corticospinal excitability 
     of the soleus. Thus, individuals with CAI who undergo balance 
     training exhibit positive neural adaptations that are linked to 
     improvements in balance performance.]

     followed. The face and content validity of the Greek version of the 
     Quick-FAAM (Quick-FAAM-GR), as well as the internal consistency and

     were examined. In addition, the construct validity of the scale was 
     examined via exploratory factor analysis as well as by testing for 
     associations with the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index, the 
     12-item Short-Form Survey (version 2), and a functional balance 
     assessment test-the Y-Balance Test. Results: Sixty participants (18 
     women) with self-reported chronic ankle instability symptoms, with a 
     median (interquartile range) age of 27 (7.7) years, participated in 
     the study. Half of the participants were included in the test-retest 
     reliability study. The Quick-FAAM-GR demonstrated face and content 
     validity. Excellent internal consistency (Cronbach α = .961) and 
     intrarater test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation 
     coefficient ICC[2,1] = .93) were demonstrated, with a comparable 
     error margin to the original version (standard error of the 
     measurement = 2.1, 95% minimum detectable change = 5.9). Associations 
     of the Quick-FAAM-GR scores to other questionnaires ranged from weak 
     to strong (Spearman rho), all being statistically significant 
     (Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index from −.26, P = .04, to 
     −.67, P < .001, and 12-item Short-Form Survey, version 2, between 
     .41 and .72, P < .001), and to the Y-Balance Test between lower-limb 
     differences (−.35 to −.58, P < .001). The exploratory factor 
     analysis confirmed the single-factor structure of this scale. No 
     floor/ceiling effects were observed. Conclusions: The Greek 
     Quick-FAAM has proven to be a valid and reliable tool for evaluating 
     chronic ankle instability and can be used for clinical and research 
     purposes in Greek-speaking individuals.]

     AB: Context: Decreased muscle strength and balance in patients with 
     functional ankle instability (FAI) can be effectively improved by 
     ankle strength training. Low-load blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) 
     training increases muscle size and strength, but there is limited 
     evidence from studies on muscle strength and balance in FAI patients. 
     Objective: To study the effects of LL-BFR training versus high-load 
     training (HLT) on muscle strength and balance in FAI patients. 
     Design: Randomized controlled trial. Participants: Forty-six young 
     adults with a history of FAI. Interventions: Participants in the 
     LL-BFR and HLT groups performed 4 sets (30 × 15 × 15 × 15) of 
     ankle training at 20% to 40% of the one-repetition maximum and 70% to 
     85% one-repetition maximum, respectively, twice a week for 6 weeks. 
     Main Outcome Measure(s): Plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, 
     and eversion muscle strength, and the Y-balance test scores were 
     assessed at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks; the thickness of the 
     tibialis anterior, triceps surae, and peroneus longus muscles were 
     assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks. Results: Inversion, eversion, 
     dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion muscle strength; tibialis anterior, 
     triceps surae, and peroneus longus thickness; and Y-balance test 
     scores were significantly increased in the LL-BFR group after 3 and 6 
     weeks compared with baseline (P < .05), with no significant 
     difference between the LL-BFR and HLT groups after 6 weeks (P > .05). 
     However, at the end of 3 weeks, eversion muscle strength and 
     Y-balance test scores were significantly higher in the LL-BFR group 
     than in the HLT group (P < .05). Conclusions: Over 6 weeks, LL-BFR 
     training was as effective as HLT in improving ankle muscle strength, 
     muscle thickness, and balance in FAI patients, but LL-BFR training 
     improved the ankle eversion muscle strength and dynamic balance more 
     than HLT did in the early stages of the intervention. This finding 
     will provide a new intervention strategy for the clinical 
     rehabilitation of FAI patients.]

     participating in a staged ACLR physiotherapy program to patients 
     participating in usual care physiotherapy through a randomized 
     controlled trial. Methods: One hundred sixty-two patients were 
     randomized to participate in staged (n = 80) or usual care 
     physiotherapy (n = 82) following ACLR and assessed preoperatively and 
     postoperatively at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. The 
     staged group completed the ACLR rehabilitation protocol at home for 
     the first 3 months, followed by usual care in-person sessions. The 
     usual care group completed in-person sessions for their entire 
     rehabilitation. Outcome measures included the Lower Extremity 
     Functional Scale, International Knee Documentation Committee 
     Questionnaire, pain, range of motion, strength, and hop testing. 
     Results: There were no statistically significant between-group 
     differences in measures of knee function at 6 months postoperative. 
     Patients in the usual care group reported significantly higher 
     International Knee Documentation Committee scores at 3 months 
     postoperative (mean difference = 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 
     10.4; P = .01). Conclusion: A staged approach to ACLR rehabilitation 
     does not appear to impede knee function at 6 months postoperative but 
     may result in worse patient reported outcomes at early follow-ups.]

     AB: Context: To assess the reliability of a remote 2D markerless 
     motion tracking method (Kinovea) to quantify knee and hip angles 
     during dynamic tasks. Methods: Fourteen healthy adults performed body 
     weight squats and lateral lunges while video recording themselves at 
     home. Knee and hip angles were quantified in the sagittal plane for 
     the squats and in the frontal plane for the lateral lunges. Two 
     students each performed the video analysis procedure twice, 2 weeks 
     apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients were used to calculate the 
     intrarater and interrater reliability for angles at maximum depth. 
     The intrarater and interrater agreement over the joint angle-time 
     signals were quantified using a validation metric; an acceptable 
     agreement threshold was set at a validation metric of 0.803 or 
     higher. Standard error of measurement (SEM) was also calculated. 
     Results: Reliability was good to excellent (intraclass correlation 
     coefficients = .80-.98) for all angle comparisons at maximum depth. 
     The agreement over the entire joint angle-time signal was acceptable 
     for all squat variables except for the interrater hip angle 
     comparison (validation metric = 0.797). None of the lateral lunge 
     variables met the threshold of acceptable agreement. The mean SEM 
     across participants for all joint angle-time signal and for maximum 
     depth was acceptable (<5°) for all measurements (SEM = 1.2°-4.9°). 
     Conclusions: Overall, the reliability, agreement, and SEM quantified 
     in this study support the integration of remote methods to quantify 
     lower-extremity kinematics into research and clinical practice.]

     AB: Context: Single- and dual-task walking gait assessments have been 
     used to identify persistent movement and cognitive dysfunction among 
     athletes with concussions. However, it is unclear whether previous 
     ankle sprain injuries confound these outcomes during baseline 
     testing. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 
     (1) ankle sprain history and (2) time since prior ankle sprain injury 
     on single- and dual-task spatiotemporal gait outcomes and cognitive 
     measures. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: We assessed 60 
     college Division-I athletes (31 with ankle sprain history; 13 females 
     and 18 males, 19.3 [0.8] y; 29 with no ankle sprain history, 14 
     females and 15 males, 19.7 [0.9] y) who completed injury history 
     forms and underwent concussion baseline testing. Athletes completed 
     single- and dual-task gait assessments by walking back and forth 
     along an 8-m walkway for 40 seconds. Athletes wore a smartphone with 
     an associated mobile application on their lumbar spine to record 
     spatiotemporal gait parameters and dual-task cognitive performance. 
     Separate multivariate analyses of variance were used to assess the 
     effects of ankle sprain injury history on spatiotemporal measures, 
     gait variability, and cognitive performance. We performed a 
     multivariate regression subanalysis on athletes who reported time 
     since injury (n = 23) to assess temporal effects on gait and 
     cognitive performance. Results: Athletes with and without a history 
     of ankle sprains had comparable spatiotemporal and gait variability 
     outcomes during single- (P = .42; P = .13) and dual-task (P = .75; P 
     = .55) conditions. Additionally, ankle sprain injury history did not 
     significantly influence cognitive performance (P = .35). Finally, 
     time since ankle sprain did not significantly affect single- (P = 
     .75) and dual-task gait (P = .69), nor cognitive performance (P = 
     .19). Conclusions: Ankle sprain injury history did not significantly 
     alter spatiotemporal gait outcomes nor cognitive performance during 
     this common clinical assessment. Future studies may consider 
     including athletes with ankle sprain injury history during concussion 
     assessments.]

     AB: Context: Hip and groin injuries are common in field sports such 
     as football, with measurement of hip strength and range of motion 
     (ROM) recommended for assessment of these conditions. We aimed to 
     report hip strength, hip ROM, and functional task performance in 
     young elite Australian football athletes. Design: Cross-sectional 
     study. Methods: Fifty-eight newly drafted Australian Football League 
     athletes completed hip abduction, adduction, internal rotation, 
     external rotation, and flexion strength testing with an adjustable 
     stabilized or hand-held dynamometer. Hip internal rotation and 
     external rotation, bent knee fall out, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM 
     were also measured. Players completed hop for distance, side bridge, 
     and star excursion balance functional tests. We compared findings 
     between the dominant and nondominant limbs. Results: We found small 
     deficits unlikely to be clinically meaningful in the dominant limb 
     for hip abduction and adduction strength, and a small deficit in the 
     nondominant limb for external rotation strength and side bridge time. 
     Athletes had lower hip internal rotation (mean difference 2.56°; 95% 
     confidence interval, 0.87 to 4.26) and total rotation ROM (2.03°; 
     95% confidence interval, 0.06 to 4.01) on the dominant limb. 
     Conclusions: There were no meaningful differences between dominant 
     and nondominant limbs for hip strength, ROM, or functional tests. Our 
     results may be used for benchmarking young male Australian football 
     athletes when targeting optimal strength and returning from injury.]

     MD: AB]
     AB: Context: The medial collateral ligament is the most commonly 
     injured ligament in the knee. The high-speed pivoting and agility 
     movements that are common in the sport of American Football put 
     participants at an increased risk for a valgus force stress from 
     contact or noncontact injuries. Positional release therapy (PRT) also 
     considered strain/counterstrain focuses on releasing the tension in a 
     tissue through unloading the involved body part. Case Presentation: 
     Two male student-athletes participating in football with a mean age 
     of 20.5 years were diagnosed by a physician with medial collateral 
     ligament grade 2 sprain. Both patients sustained their injuries in a 
     regular season game with a contact valgus force from an opposing 
     player. Management and Outcomes: After the initial 72 hours of 
     compression, elevation, and cryotherapy, the patients were both 
     treated with PRT followed by progressive loading exercises. Following 
     4 treatment sessions of PRT over the next 6 days, the patients 
     started with quadriceps engagement exercises, single-leg squats to 
     60° knee flexion, side steps, triceps dips, slow controlled lunges, 
     and toe walk. The patients progressed to full body weight squats, 
     single-leg landing, step-up tri-extension, and sidekicks with a leg 
     on table. Then, the patients completed function movements and 
     sports-specific exercises. Conclusions: In this case series, 2 
     patients competing in intercollege American Football were treated 
     with PRT and progressive loading exercises to facilitate return to 
     unrestricted activities and improve outcome measures. Commonly, a 
     grade 2 medial collateral ligament sprain is conservatively treated 
     with return to sport taking 20 days on average. In this type 2 case 
     series, the clinician found success utilizing PRT early in the 
     recovery process, which in these 2 cases lead to restoration of 
     function, outcome measure improvement, and an expedited return to 
     sport. The expedited return to sport occurred at an average of 18 
     days for these patients.]

     AB: Background: Sports function and psychological readiness to return 
     to sports (RTS) are important outcomes when evaluating rehabilitation 
     after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). It is, 
     however, unclear which specific factors contribute most to these 
     outcomes. Purpose: To determine associations between demographic 
     characteristics, objective measurements of physical function, 
     patient-reported outcome measure scores, sports-related function 
     assessed with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) 
     Sport and Recreation subscale, and psychological readiness to RTS 
     assessed with the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after 
     Injury (ACL-RSI) scale at 1 year after ACLR. Study. Design: 
     Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: At a mean of 
     12.5 ± 2.0 months after ACLR, 143 participants (50.3% female), with 
     a mean age of 25.0 ± 5.7 years, were assessed for demographic 
     characteristics, physical factors (hop performance, muscle strength, 
     ankle and hip range of motion), and psychological factors (KOOS Pain 
     and Symptoms subscales, Perceived Stress Scale, fear of reinjury) as 
     well as the KOOS Sport and Recreation subscale and ACL-RSI scale. 
     Backward linear regression models were used to evaluate factors 
     associated with sports function and psychological readiness to RTS. 
     Results: Lower isokinetic knee extension peak torque (limb symmetry 
     index) (B = 18.38 [95% CI, 3.01-33.75]), lower preinjury activity 
     level (B = 2.00 [95% CI, 0.87-3.14]), greater knee pain (B = 0.90 
     [95% CI, 0.70-1.10]), shorter time between injury and reconstruction 
     (B = 0.16 [95% CI, 0.05-0.26]), and greater fear of reinjury (B = 
     0.11 [95% CI, 0.01-0.20]) were associated with a worse KOOS Sport and 
     Recreation subscore (R2 = 0.683). A shorter hop distance (B = 0.15 
     [95% CI, 0.00-0.29]) was associated with a lower ACL-RSI score (R2 = 
     0.245). Conclusion: A combination of knee muscle strength, activity 
     level, knee pain, timing of surgery, and fear of reinjury accounted 
     for approximately 70% of the variation in sports function at 1 year 
     after ACLR. In contrast, there was only 1 weak association between 
     physical function and psychological readiness to RTS at this time 
     point. Thus, factors associated with current sports function are much 
     better known than features related to psychological readiness to 
     RTS.]

     AB: Background: Recently, interest in anterior cruciate ligament 
     (ACL) preservation and repair after proximal ACL tears has been 
     resurrected. Although good clinical outcomes have been reported in 
     the literature with adequate patient selection, to date detailed 
     scientific evidence for the functional benefit of primary ACL repair 
     with ligament augmentation is scarce. Purpose: To compare 
     patient-reported, clinical, and functional outcomes in patients 2 
     years after ACL repair and InternalBrace augmentation (ACL-IB) with 
     age- and sex-matched patients 2 years after ACL reconstruction 
     (ACL-R) and with matched healthy controls. Study. Design: Cohort 
     study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: In total, 29 patients 2 years 
     after ACL-IB, 27 sex- and age- matched patients 2 years after ACL-R 
     (hamstring autografts), and 29 matched healthy controls were 
     included. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the 
     International Knee Documentation Committee score, Knee injury and 
     Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, EQ-5D-5L, Tegner Activity Scale, and 
     Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sports after Injury scale. 
     Surgery time was recorded. For clinical outcomes, range of motion and 
     thigh and shank circumference were measured, and passive anterior 
     translation was determined using the Rolimeter. Isokinetic muscle 
     strength was measured using a Biodex dynamometer. The limb symmetry 
     index (operated/contralateral or nondominant/dominant × 100), 
     side-to-side differences (operated - contralateral, nondominant - 
     dominant), and hamstring-quadriceps ratios were calculated for 
     functional parameters. Failure and reoperation rates were not 
     compared. Results: Two years after surgery, patients treated with 
     ACL-IB showed good to excellent patient-reported outcomes comparable 
     with those of patients after ACL-R. Surgery time, including 
     concomitant surgeries, was significantly shorter in the ACL-IB group 
     (mean, 81 minutes) compared with the ACL-R group (mean, 97 minutes) 
     (P = .024). Isokinetic muscle strength was comparable between patient 
     groups without significant differences in extensor and flexor 
     strength or in hamstring-quadriceps ratios. Conclusion: These results 
     suggest that ACL-IB achieves comparable patient-reported, clinical, 
     and functional outcomes with ACL-R at 2 years postoperatively and, 
     after careful patient selection, should be considered as a valuable 
     early treatment alternative for proximal ACL tears.]

     AB: Background: Arthrofibrosis (AF) after anterior cruciate ligament 
     reconstruction (ACLR) remains a challenge. There is a paucity of data 
     on arthroscopic interventions for AF after ACLR. Purpose: To (1) 
     describe the patient, injury, and surgical characteristics and 
     patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of those requiring an arthroscopic 
     intervention for loss of motion after ACLR and (2) compare outcomes 
     between patients undergoing an early intervention (within 3 months) 
     versus those undergoing a late intervention (after 3 months). Study. 
     Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients with a 
     history of ACLR and a subsequent operative procedure for 
     postoperative AF at a single institution between 2000 and 2018 were 
     retrospectively identified. Arthroscopic interventions included lysis 
     of adhesions, capsular release with or without manipulation under 
     anesthesia, and excision of cyclops lesions. Patients were excluded 
     if they had a knee dislocation or multiple-ligament injury, a 
     periarticular fracture, or less than 2-year follow-up from the 
     arthroscopic intervention. PROs including the Tegner activity score, 
     visual analog scale pain score, and International Knee Documentation 
     Committee score as well as knee range of motion (ROM) were recorded. 
     Results: A total of 40 patients were included with a mean age of 27.2 
     years (range, 11.0-63.8 years) at surgery and a mean follow-up of 
     10.0 years (range, 2.9-20.7 years). The mean preoperative flexion and 
     extension were 102° (range, 40°-150°) and 8° (range, 0°-25°), 
     respectively. The mean postoperative flexion and extension were 131° 
     (range, 110° to 150°) and 0° (range, -10° to 5°), respectively. 
     After the arthroscopic intervention, the mean ROM improved from 94° 
     (range, 40°-140°) preoperatively to 131° (range, 107°-152°) at 
     final follow-up (P < .001), and the visual analog scale pain score 
     improved from 3.0 preoperatively to 1.2 postoperatively (P = .001). 
     Overall, 13 patients (32.5%) underwent an intervention within 3 
     months and 27 (67.5%) after 3 months. The early intervention group 
     had a higher postoperative International Knee Documentation Committee 
     score compared with the late intervention group (86.8 vs 71.7, 
     respectively; P = .035). Conclusion: An arthroscopic intervention for 
     AF after ACLR successfully improved knee ROM and pain. Patients who 
     underwent either early or late surgery obtained satisfactory motion 
     and function, although improved PROs were observed when the 
     intervention occurred within 3 months of the primary procedure.]

     AB: Background: Arthrofibrosis can limit function and return to sport 
     after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Previously 
     reported risk factors for developing arthrofibrosis after ACL 
     reconstruction include female sex, age <18 years, time from injury to 
     surgery <28 days, concomitant meniscal repair, prolonged 
     immobilization, and genetic factors. There is a lack of evidence 
     regarding whether race plays a significant role. Hypothesis: The risk 
     of undergoing manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) and/or lysis of 
     adhesions (LOA) after primary ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar 
     tendon-bone (BTB) autograft in female basketball players is higher in 
     African American players than in White players. Study. Design: 
     Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Using a 
     computerized relational database, the authors identified competitive 
     female basketball players who underwent primary ACL reconstruction 
     with BTB autograft by the senior author over a 13-year period. Data 
     previously entered from examinations and surgical findings were 
     reviewed retrospectively. Univariate statistics and multivariable 
     logistic regression were used to assess the relationship between 
     undergoing subsequent MUA and/or LOA and study predictors. Results: A 
     total of 186 knees (114 African American knees and 72 White knees) 
     met inclusion criteria. The overall rate of MUA and/or LOA was 8.6%. 
     Thirteen African American knees (11.4%) and 3 White knees (4.2%) 
     underwent MUA and/or LOA for treatment of arthrofibrosis. No study 
     predictor was found to have a statistically significant relationship 
     with the rate of MUA and/or LOA on univariate analysis. However, when 
     controlling for body mass index and previously described risk factors 
     (age <18 years, time from injury to surgery ≤28 days, and 
     concomitant meniscal repair) in the logistic regression model, the 
     authors found that MUA and/or LOA was more likely in African American 
     (odds ratio, 4.01 [95% CI, 1.01-15.92]; P = .049) than in White 
     female players and in patients who underwent ACL reconstruction 
     within 28 days of injury (odds ratio, 4.01 [95% CI, 1.18-13.57]; P = 
     .026) compared with those with surgery delayed beyond 28 days. 
     Conclusion: In female basketball players, the present study found a 
     statistically significantly increased risk for undergoing MUA and/or 
     LOA after primary ACL reconstruction with BTB autograft in African 
     American females compared with White females and in patients who 
     underwent ACL reconstruction within 28 days of injury.]

     deficits. As running is a submaximal effort task characterized by 
     limited time to develop knee extensor torque, quadriceps rate of 
     torque development (RTD) may be more closely associated with recovery 
     of running knee mechanics than peak torque (PT). Purpose: To assess 
     the influence of recovery in quadriceps PT and RTD symmetry on knee 
     kinematic and kinetic symmetry during running over the initial 2 
     years after ACLR. Study. Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. 
     Methods: A total of 39 Division I collegiate athletes (106 testing 
     sessions; 19 female) completed serial isometric performance testing 
     and running analyses between 3 and 24 months after ACLR. Athletes 
     performed maximal and rapid isometric knee extension efforts with 
     each limb to assess PT and RTD between-limb symmetry indices (PTLSI 
     and RTDLSI), respectively. Peak knee flexion difference (PKFDIFF) and 
     peak knee extensor moment limb symmetry index (PKEMLSI) during 
     running were computed. Multivariable linear mixed-effects models 
     assessed the influence of PTLSI and RTDLSI on PKFDIFF and PKEMLSI 
     over the initial 2 years after ACLR. Results: Significant main 
     effects of RTDLSI (P < .001) and time (P≤ .02) but not PTLSI (P≥ 
     .24) were observed for both PKFDIFF and PKEMLSI models. For a 10% 
     increase in RTDLSI, while controlling for PTLSI and time, a 0.9° 
     (95% CI, 0.5°-1.3°) reduction in PKFDIFF and a 3.5% (95% CI, 
     1.9%-5.1%) increase in PKEMLSI are expected. For every month after 
     ACLR, a 0.2° (95% CI, 0.1°-0.4°) reduction in PKFDIFF and a 1.3% 
     (95% CI, 0.6%-2.0%) increase in PKEMLSI are expected, controlling for 
     PTLSI and RTDLSI. Conclusion: Quadriceps RTDLSI was more strongly 
     associated with symmetrical knee biomechanics during running compared 
     with PTLSI or time throughout the first 2 years after ACLR.]

     AB: Purpose: Musculoskeletal strength can be impaired in pediatric 
     solid organ transplant recipients. Exercise training programs can be 
     beneficial but in-person delivery can be challenging; virtual 
     exercise programs can alleviate some of these challenges. This 
     feasibility study aimed to deliver an 8-week virtual exercise program 
     in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients. Method: Program 
     delivery occurred 3 times per week for 30 minutes. An exercise stress 
     test was completed prior to program start. The Bruininks-Oseretsky 
     Test of Motor Proficiency strength subtest and self-report surveys 
     were used to assess musculoskeletal strength, quality of life, 
     fatigue, and physical activity. Contact was maintained through a text 
     messaging platform. Z scores were calculated using standardized 
     normative data. Medians (interquartile range) are reported for all 
     other data. Results: Eleven participants completed the program (2 
     liver, 5 kidney, 4 heart; 58% females; median age = 11.5 [10.3-13.8] 
     y). Six participants attended ≥60% of classes, 5 participants 
     attended <50% of classes. After 8 weeks, strength scores improved (Z 
     score, Pre: −1.0 [−1.65 to −0.60] to Post: −0.2 [−1.30 to 
     0.40]; P = .007) with no change in other outcome measures. 
     Conclusion: The virtual exercise program was delivered without 
     technical issues and received positive participant feedback. 
     Engagement and costs need to be considered.]

     AB: The main goal of the present study was the exploration of the 
     antifungal properties of Agaricomycetes mushrooms. Among twenty-three 
     tested mushrooms against A. niger, B. cinerea, F. oxysporum, and G. 
     bidwellii, Schizophyllum commune demonstrated highest inhibition 
     rates and showed 35.7%, 6.5%, 50.4%, and 66.0% of growth inhibition, 
     respectively. To reveal culture conditions enhancing the antifungal 
     potential of Sch. commune, several carbon (lignocellulosic substrates 
     among them) and nitrogen sources and their optimal concentrations 
     were investigated. Presence of 6% mandarin juice production waste 
     (MJPW) and 6% of peptone in nutrient medium promoted antifungal 
     activity of selected mushroom. It was determined that, extracts 
     obtained in the presence of MJPW effectively inhibited the grow of 
     pathogenic fungi. Moreover, the content of phenolic compounds in the 
     extracts obtained from Sch. commune grown on MJPW was several times 
     higher (0.87 ± 0.05 GAE/g to 2.38 ± 0.08 GAE/g) than the extracts 
     obtained from the mushroom grown on the synthetic (glycerol 
     contained) nutrient medium (0.21 ± 0.03 GAE/g to 0.88 ± 0.05 
     GAE/g). Flavonoid contents in the extracts from Sch. commune varied 
     from 0.58 ± 0.03 to 27.2 ± 0.8 mg QE/g. Identification of phenolic 
     compounds composition in water and ethanol extracts were provided by 
     mass spectrometry analysis. Extracts demonstrate considerable free 
     radical scavenging activities and the IC50 values were generally low 
     for the extracts, ranging from 1.9 mg/ml to 6.7 mg/ml. All the 
     samples displayed a positive correlation between their concentration 
     (0.05−15.0 mg/ml) and DPPH radical scavenging activity. This 
     investigation revealed that Sch. commune mushroom has great potential 
     to be used as a source of antifungal and antioxidant substances.]

     AB: Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. The current cancer 
     treatments including chemo-, radio- and immuno-therapies pose various 
     side effects, and chances of recurrence that demand for new 
     therapeutics to overcome the issues with existing ones. Mushrooms are 
     considered a potential source of novel therapeutic agents. Ganoderma 
     colossus, a non-edible wood-inhabiting mushroom, is known for certain 
     medical properties. The present study aimed to investigate the 
     possible anticancer activity of methanolic, ethyl acetate, and 
     chloroform extracts of G. colossus, against MCF-7 cells and the 
     mechanism of action(s). MTT assay and gene expression studies were 
     carried out by following the standard protocols. The results 
     demonstrated that among the three solvents, the ethyl acetate crude 
     extract of the mushroom exhibited potential cytotoxic activity on 
     MCF-7 (IC50, 17.2 ± 2.7). The DNA damage induced by the solvent 
     extracts of G. colossus was observed by H2AX foci formation. The TP53 
     over-expression and flow cytometry analysis indicated that checkpoint 
     activation followed by cell cycle arrest occurred at G1/G0 phase in 
     response to the extract treatment. The dual acridine orange/ethidium 
     bromide (AO/EB) staining revealed apoptosis-associated changes in the 
     cells. Analysis of caspase 3 activations by immunophenotyping 
     confirmed the apoptotic process in the extract-treated cells. Bcl-2 
     and TP53 mRNA expression data by RT-PCR disclosed the apoptosis 
     pathway. The GC- MS spectral data of the ethyl acetate crude extract 
     of the mushroom indicated the presence of molecules capable of 
     inducing apoptosis. The present study warrants further studies to 
     isolate the molecule(s) from G. colossus which may be a potential 
     drug candidate for breast cancers.]

     AB: The compound ganoderma lucidum spore powder (GLSP) has emerged as 
     an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative regulator. In this study, we 
     explored the roles of GLSP against dextran sulfate sodium 
     (DSS)-induced mouse colitis that can mimic human inflammatory bowel 
     disease (IBD). GLSP was administered by oral gavage at a dosage of 
     150 mg/kg/day to the acute colitis mice induced by DSS. The 
     DSS-induced mouse weight loss, colonic shortening, diarrhea and 
     bloody stool were observably alleviated after GLSP treatment. The 
     lesion of macroscopic and microscopic signs of the disease was 
     reduced significantly and DSS-induced gut barrier dysfunction was 
     restored via increasing the level of claudin-1, ZO1, Occu, and ZO2 
     with GLSP. Meanwhile, the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-18 
     in the colon were reduced in the GLSP-treated groups. In addition, 
     phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK1/2, p38, and AKT was suppressed 
     after GLSP treatment. All these results demonstrated that GLSP owned 
     a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis by inhibition of MAPK 
     pathway, which provides a promising therapeutic approach for the 
     treatment of colitis.]

     AB: Inonotus obliquus is a medicinal mushroom that contains the 
     valuable I. obliquus polysaccharides (IOP), which is known for its 
     bioactive properties. Studies have shown that IOP could inhibit 
     oxidative stress induced premature aging and DNA damage, and delay 
     body aging. However, the molecular mechanism of IOP in improving skin 
     photoaging remains unclear, which prevents the development and 
     utilization of I. obliquus in the field of skin care. In this study, 
     ultraviolet B (UVB) induced human immortalized keratinocyte (HaCaT) 
     cell photoaging model was used to explore the mechanism of IOP in 
     relieving skin photoaging. Results showed that IOP inhibited cell 
     senescence and apoptosis by reducing the protein expressions of p16, 
     p21, and p53. IOP increased HO-1, SOD, and CAT expressions to achieve 
     Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, thus improving antioxidant effects and preventing 
     ROS generation. Furthermore, IOP enhanced the expression levels of 
     p-AMPK, LC3B, and Beclin-1 to alleviate the autophagy inhibition in 
     UVB-induced HaCaT cells. Based on these findings, our data suggested 
     that IOP may be used to develop effective natural anti-photoaging 
     ingredients to promote skin health.]

     AB: Ganoderma species have been used in folk medicine against 
     different illnesses and are characterized by producing a diversity of 
     bioactive metabolites (triterpenoids, polysaccharides, flavonoids, 
     and phenols) with numerous medicinal effects (anti-proliferative, 
     antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial). This work aims to 
     evaluate ethanolic extracts of fruiting bodies of Ganoderma 
     oerstedii, G. weberianum, and G. subincrustatum strains from the 
     Sonoran Desert in the anti-proliferative activity by the MTT assay on 
     cancer cell lines; anti-inflammatory effect by quantifying nitric 
     oxide (NO) production; antioxidant activity by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP 
     assays; total phenolic and flavonoid content by Folin-Ciocalteu and 
     AlCl3 method, respectively; antibacterial activity by the broth 
     microdilution method against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus 
     aureus. Extracts showed anti-proliferative activity with IC50 < 100 
     µg/mL on the cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, A549, and HeLa, except G. 
     subincrustatum extract with an IC50 > 100 µg/mL; anti-proliferative 
     activity was not selective, being affected non-cancerous cell line 
     ARPE-19. Extracts showed significant inhibition of NO release in 
     cells stimulated by LPS, up to 60% with G. subincrustatum and G. 
     oerstedii, and 47% with G. weberianum. All tested assays showed 
     moderate antioxidant potential; the most active was G. lucium 
     (control strain) with IC50 of 69 and 30 µg/mL by DPPH and ABTS 
     respectively; and 271 µg Trolox equivalents/g by FRAP. Total phenols 
     and flavonoids ranged from 38 to 56 mg GAE/g and 0.53 to 0.93 mg 
     QE/g, respectively. A significant correlation was found between the 
     antioxidant activities revealed by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP with total 
     phenol and flavonoid contents. Antibacterial activity was weak 
     against S. aureus (MIC50 > 10 mg/mL). These results demonstrate that 
     tested Ganoderma mushrooms have medicinal potential such as 
     anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative.]

     phylogenetic relationship analysis. The single factor results 
     revealed that the optimal carbon source, nitrogen source, culture 
     temperature, and pH for the mycelia growth of Ph. adiposa were 
     glucose, yeast paste, 25°C, and pH 6.5−7.0, respectively.

     AB: Mushrooms have two components, the fruiting body, which 
     encompasses the stalk and the cap, and the mycelium, which supports 
     the fruiting body underground. The part of the mushroom most commonly 
     consumed is the fruiting body. Given that it is more time consuming 
     to harvest the fruiting body versus simply the mycelia, we were 
     interested in understanding the difference in metabolite content 
     between the fruiting bodies and mycelia of four widely consumed 
     mushrooms in Taiwan: Agrocybe cylindracea (AC), Coprinus comatus 
     (CC), Hericium erinaceus (HE), and Hypsizygus marmoreus (HM). In 
     total, we identified 54 polar metabolites using 1H NMR spectroscopy 
     that included sugar alcohols, amino acids, organic acids, nucleosides 
     and purine/pyrimidine derivatives, sugars, and others. Generally, the 
     fruiting bodies of AC, CC, and HM contained higher amounts of 
     essential amino acids than their corresponding mycelia. Among 
     fruiting bodies, HE had the lowest essential amino acid content. 
     Trehalose was the predominant carbohydrate in most samples except for 
     the mycelia of AC, in which the major sugar was glucose. The amount 
     of adenosine, uridine, and xanthine in the samples was similar, and 
     was higher in fruiting bodies compared with mycelia, except for HM. 
     The organic acid and sugar alcohol content between fruiting bodies 
     and mycelia did not tend to be different. Although each mushroom had 
     a unique metabolic profile, the metabolic profile of fruiting bodies 
     and mycelia were most similar for CC and HE, suggesting that the 
     mycelia of CC and HE may be good replacements for their corresponding 
     fruiting bodies. Additionally, each mushroom species had a unique 
     polar metabolite fingerprint, which could be utilized to identify 
     adulteration.]

     AB: Morel mushrooms, Morchella species are highly nutritional, 
     excellently edible and medicinal. Anticancer activity of M. elata, 
     growing in forests of Kashmir Himalaya was studied. Ethyl acetate 
     extract of fruiting bodies of M. elata (MEAE) was evaluated for 
     cytotoxicity by MTT assay using Daltons lymphoma ascites (DLA), human 
     colon cancer (HCT-116) and normal cell lines. Anti-carcinogenic and 
     antiangiogenic activities of MEAE were tested using mouse models. 
     Proapoptotic activity was detected by double staining of acridine 
     orange-ethidium bromide assay. MEAE was partially purified by column 
     chromatography and the bioactive compounds were identified by LC-MS 
     analysis. The bioactive extract of M. elata showed significant 
     cytotoxicic activity against DLA (P < 0.05), HCT-116 cell lines (P < 
     0.05) and did not possess appreciable adverse effect on the viability 
     of normal cells. At a concentration of 100 μg/mL, 60% cell death was 
     observed in HCT-116 cell line while 80% cell death was found in DLA 
     cell line. The extract also possessed profound anticarcinogenic, 
     antiangiogenic and proapoptotic activities. LC-MS analysis showed 
     celastrol (RT 9.504, C29H38O4, MW 450.27), convallatoxin (RT 9.60, 
     C29H42O10, MW 550.27), cucurbitacin A (RT 11.97, C32H46O9, MW 574.71) 
     and madecassic acid (RT 14.35, C30H48O6, MW 504.70) as the major 
     bioactive components. Current experimental studies indicated that 
     bioactive extract of M. elata possessed significant anticancer 
     activity. Being an excellently edible mushroom, the potential 
     therapeutic use of M. elata and its bioactive extract in 
     complementary therapy of cancer is envisaged.]

     AB: Ganoderma is a medicinally important mushroom and has been used 
     since ancient times. However, mostly G. lucidum has been used for 
     therapeutic purposes, in form of tea, dietary and drug supplements 
     but other species of Ganoderma are still remaining underexploited. 
     This study is the first approach to valorize Ganoderma teas prepared 
     from different wild species of Ganoderma other than G. lucidum with 
     respect to both phytochemically and therapeutically through 
     investigation of their phytochemical, carbohydrate contents and 
     exploring their antioxidant activity. Phytochemical contents such as 
     phenol and flavonoids were quantified using spectrophotometry 
     methods. The carbohydrate content of the teas was estimated by phenol 
     sulphuric acid method. The biochemical analysis revealed the teas 
     contained a notable amount of phenolic compounds ranging from 19.15 
     to 40.2 μg GAE/mg of extract and also showed significant content of 
     flavonoids. Further, antioxidant potential in terms of DPPH and ABTS 
     radical scavenging ability and total antioxidant capacity was also 
     evaluated. According to the results, G. resinaceum tea showed better 
     potential in scavenging DPPH (EC50 36 ug/mL) and ABTS radicals (EC50 
     3 9 ug/mL) whereas the least effect was shown for the tea of G. 
     ahmedi. Therefore, tea showing the best results, i.e. G. resinaceum 
     tea, was also analyzed for cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells. It 
     was found that the tea made from G. resinaceum inhibited cellular 
     growth and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner with maximum 
     growth inhibition (61%) observed at the highest concentration of 2.3 
     mg/mL. The presence of a greater quantity of carbohydrates in G. 
     resinaceum tea also justified the remarkable anticancer potential of 
     the tea. Overall, our findings indicated that a few wild species of 
     Ganoderma other than G. lucidum have great potential to be valued as 
     a healthy beverage with immense therapeutic benefits.]

     simultaneous presence of selenium, zinc and iron may have effects on 
     the selenium uptake in the mycelia of the winter mushroom (also known 
     as enoki), Flammulina velutipes. Response surface methodology was 
     used to optimize concentrations of selenium, zinc and iron in the 
     range of 0 to 120 mg L-1. The findings showed that application of 
     selenium, zinc and iron (singly, in pairs, or triads) significantly 
     enhanced the selenium accumulation in the mycelia. The highest amount 
     of the selenium accumulation was observed when selenium (60 mg L-1) 
     and zinc (120 mg L-1) were applied into submerged culture media, 
     concurrently, leading to an 85-fold and 88-fold increase in the 
     selenium content of the mycelia compared to that of the mycelia 
     treated with selenium only and untreated mycelia, respectively. In 
     addition, accumulation of selenium into the mycelia had no 
     deteriorative effects on the mycelial biomass. The findings presented 
     in this study may have implications for daily nutrition and

     AB: Herbal products found in nature can serve as great systems of 
     study for drug design. The Amanita muscaria mushroom is native to 
     many parts of the Northern Hemisphere and has a very distinctive 
     appearance with its red cap and white spotted warts. The mushroom 
     comprises several pharmacologically active alkaloids, including 
     muscazone, muscarine, ibotenic acid, and muscimol, the latter two 
     compounds being potent GABA agonists. Muscimol has served as a 
     backbone in the design of GABA agonists devoid of effects on the 
     GABA-metabolizing enzyme, GABA transaminase, and GABA uptake systems. 
     In this sense, several analogs of muscimol have been synthesized and 
     studied including THIP, THPO, iso-THIP, iso-THAZ and 4-PIOL which all 
     interact with the GABA receptors much differently. The growing 
     pharmacological and toxicological interest based on many conflicting 
     opinions on the use of the neuroprotective role of muscimol analogs 
     against some neurodegenerative diseases, its potent role in the 
     treatment of cerebral ischemia and other socially significant health 
     conditions provided the basis for this review.]

     AB: Morchella esculenta, commonly known as yellow morels, is an 
     edible and medicinal mushroom popular worldwide for its unique flavor 
     and culinary purposes. The traditional medical system effectively 
     uses morels against infertility, fatigue, cancer, muscular pain, 
     cough, and cold. The M. esculenta possesses many health-promoting 
     nutritional components such as mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
     polyphenols, protein hydrolysates, vitamins, amino acids and 
     minerals. The potential medicinal properties of morels is due to 
     polysaccharides (galactomannan, chitin, β-glucans, and 
     β-1,3-1,6-glucan) present that has high economic importance 
     worldwide. Polysaccharides present possess a broad spectrum of 
     biological activities such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, 
     anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant. However, the toxicity 
     and clinical trials to prove its safety and efficacy for medicinal 
     uses are yet to be evaluated. Moreover, the separation, purification, 
     identification, and structural elucidation of active compounds 
     responsible for the unique flavors and biological activities are 
     still lacking in M. esculenta. The available information provides a 
     new base for future perspectives. It highlights the need for further 
     studies of this potent medicinal mushroom species as a source of 
     beneficial therapeutic drugs and nutraceutical supplements.]

     various biological activities. This study aimed to investigate the 
     effects of solid-state fermentation by Ph. linteus on the yield of 
     bioactive compounds and antioxidant activities of beans. Four bean 
     substrates were prepared and inoculated with inoculum of three 
     strains of Ph. linteus, respectively. During the cultivation, the 
     harvested samples were dried, grounded, extracted, and determined the 
     contents of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activities. The 
     results indicated that the mung bean fermented by Ph. linteus 04 had 
     the highest polysaccharide content (98.8 mg/g). The highest total 
     phenolic and flavonoid contents were in fermented soybeans by Ph. 
     linteus 03 (15.03 mg gallic acid equivalents/g and 63.24 mg rutin 
     equivalents/g, respectively). The 
     2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical 
     scavenging activities of hot water extracts were higher than those of 
     ethanolic extracts for fermented beans by three Ph. linteus strains. 
     However, the superoxide anion radical scavenging ability of ethanolic 
     extracts was higher than those of hot water extracts in the fermented 
     beans of the three strains. The ferrous ion (Fe2+)−chelating 
     abilities of hot water extracts were higher than those of ethanolic 
     extracts in fermented beans by Ph. linteus 03 and 04. In contrast, 
     ethanolic extracts were higher than hot water extracts in fermented 
     beans by Ph. linteus 06. Overall, these results indicate that the 
     fermentation by Ph. linteus strains increased the bioactive compounds 
     and antioxidant activities of four beans.]

     AB: The genus Ganoderma has a long history of use in traditional 
     Asiatic medicine due to its different nutritional and medicinal 
     properties. In Mexico, the species G. tuberculosum is used in 
     indigenous communities, for example, the Wixaritari and mestizos of 
     Villa Guerrero Jalisco for the treatment of diseases that may be 
     related to parasitic infections; however, few chemical studies 
     corroborate its traditional medicinal potential. Thereby, the 
     objective of this study was to isolate and identify anti-parasitic 
     activity compounds from a strain of G. tuberculosum native to Mexico. 
     From the fruiting bodies of G. tuberculosum (GVL-21) a hexane extract 
     was obtained which was subjected to guided fractioning to isolate 
     pure compounds. The in vitro anti-parasitic activity of the pure 
     compound (IC50) was assayed against Leishmania amazonensis, 
     Trypanosoma cruzi, Acanthamoeba castellanii Neff, and Naegleria 
     fowleri. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity (CC50) of the isolated 
     compounds was determined against murine macrophages. The guided 
     fractioning produced 5 compounds: ergosterol (1), 
     ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (2), ergosta-7,22-dien-3β-ol (3), 
     3,5-dihydroxy-ergosta-7,22-dien-6-one (4), and ganoderic acid DM (5). 
     Compounds 2 and 5 showed the best anti-parasitic activity in an IC50 
     range of 54.34 ± 8.02 to 12.38 ± 2.72 µM against all the parasites 
     assayed and low cytotoxicity against murine macrophages. The present 
     study showed for the first time the in vitro anti-parasitic activity 
     of compounds 1−5 against L. amazonensis, T. cruzi, A. castellanii 
     Neff, and N. fowleri, corroborating the medicinal potential of 
     Ganoderma and its traditional applications.]

     AB: To investigate the effect of Agaricus bisporus and soybean oil as 
     complex fat substitutes on the storage characteristics of chicken 
     sausages, a pre-mixture of A. bisporus and soybean oil (1:2) was used 
     to replace 0% (CK), 30% (T30), 60% (T60), and 90% (T90) of pork back 
     fat in chicken sausages. The changes in color (brightness value, L*; 
     redness value, a*; and yellowness value, b*), texture, pH, and total 
     viable count of the sausages were examined at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 
     30 and 35 d of storage at 4°C, respectively. The results showed that 
     A. bisporus and soybean oil altered the color of the sausages. At the 
     same storage time, compared with CK, L* values of fat-reduced chicken 
     sausages decreased significantly, while a* values increased 
     significantly (P < 0.05), b* values increased significantly (P < 
     0.05) at the 10 d of storage. During storage, L* and a* values of CK 
     gradually decreased and b* values gradually increased, fat-reduced 
     sausages exhibited opposite trends in a* values and b* values 
     compared with CK. The hardness and chewiness of fat-reduced sausages 
     increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with CK at the same 
     storage time. During storage, the overall hardness of fat-reduced 
     sausages increased, and the springiness and chewiness fluctuated. T60 
     did not change significantly in cohesiveness throughout the storage 
     period (P < 0.05). The pH of fat-reduced sausage was relatively 
     stable during storage. The higher the amount of A. bisporus added, 
     the greater the pH. The pH of T60 did not change throughout the 
     storage period. A. bisporus and soybean oil showed some antibacterial 
     effect on sausage and the minimum shelf life of chicken sausage with 
     A. bisporus was 25 d. In conclusion, A. bisporus and soybean oil 
     increased the redness and hardness of the sausages during storage, 
     but the pH and total viable bacteria count remained relatively 
     stable. T60 displayed the most stable storage properties among them, 
     making it the optimum method for the manufacturing of fat-reduced 
     chicken sausages.]

     Pakistan was evaluated. Among the different media used, maximum 
     cultural growth was observed on pine needles extract agar (PEA) 
     medium at 24°C. Cultured strains on PEA medium were used to spawn on 
     wheat, sorghum and barley grains. Sorghum grains at 24°C were found 
     as the best combination for spawn production of this mushroom. Total 
     yield efficacy was investigated on a variety of substrates. A mixed 
     substrate of Morus sawdust and pine sawdust at 20°C showed the 
     optimum yield. Element analysis of wild and cultivated strain was 
     carried out and revealed that this mushroom is enriched with 
     macronutrients. These results showed that S. latifolia has great 
     artificial growth potential. Its domestication can compete with 
     commonly growing mushrooms in nutritional and pharmaceutical 
     attributes.]

     AB: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which has a high 
     prevalence and mortality rate, is an irreversible condition marked by 
     airflow restriction with different degrees of reversible damage. 
     Notably, there is no cure for COPD, whose treatment primarily relies 
     on rehabilitation exercises to improve airflow limitation. In this 
     paper, a vision-based rehabilitation exercise efficacy prediction 
     system is proposed to assess the efficacy of rehabilitation training 
     for COPD patients. A camera was utilized to capture rehabilitation 
     training videos of COPD patients, and we also collected various 
     physical indicators. In addition, we used clustering algorithm to 
     divide patients with different rehabilitation effects for subsequent 
     progression analysis. Our model achieved a classification of 
     rehabilitation progress accuracy of 90.6%, making it possible to 
     effectively obtain favorable rehabilitation training results without 
     physician supervision. It was meaningful for helping COPD patients 
     get effective feedback when training alone.]

     AB: Background: Chronic primary insomnia (CPI) is a commonly 
     encountered clinical disease, the incidence of which has been rising 
     in recent years. In theoretical contexts, the temperature of 
     acupoints in CPI patients is higher than that in unaffected 
     individuals together with concomitant increases in fatigue index and 
     intracranial arterial velocity. Acupuncture has long been used to 
     treat insomnia, and the sleep three-needle acupuncture (STA) approach 
     represents one promising such treatment for this condition. However, 
     no studies to date have assessed the ability of this technique to 
     lower acupoint temperature values or to improve the Insomnia Severity 
     Index (ISI) in treated individuals. Methods: The present exploration 
     is a prospective, randomized, assessor-blind, controlled trial. 
     Totally, 102 adult patients with CPI will be recruited with varying 
     levels of insomnia severity (mild, moderate, severe) and randomized 
     into six equally sized groups. Patients in these groups will then 
     undergo STA together with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or CBT 
     alone. Acupuncture will be administered for 30min per treatment 2-3 
     times per week (7 days per cycle) for a maximum of 10 sessions in 4 
     cycles. All patients underwent CBT for 4 weeks. In addition, 17 
     patients will be recruited for a healthy control group. Primary 
     outcomes will include acupoint temperature variations and ISI values, 
     while secondary outcomes will include fatigue index values, 
     intracranial arterial velocity, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
     (PSQI) values. Discussion: This study aims to test the theory that 
     STA can lower acupoint temperatures and improve ISI values in CPI 
     patients. Trial registration: Chinese]

     AB: The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of 
     biofeedback equipment with a tilt sensor and a neck correction 
     exercise program on balance control ability, proprioception, and 
     craniovertebral angle (CVA) in young adults. Ten students (M/F, 7/3) 
     aged 20-30 years attending Sunmoon University in Asan-si, South 
     Korea, participated in this study. All subjects participated in three 
     sessions. These sessions consisted of a biofeedback session with a 
     tilt sensor, followed by an exercise session, and a combined session 
     involving biofeedback equipment with a tilt sensor and exercise. Each 
     session takes 30min. The sessions were conducted with a one-day 
     interval between each one. Before the start of the experiment, 
     physical characteristics were measured, and proprioception, balance 
     control ability, and CVA were evaluated. The exercise program 
     significantly improved the stability index (SI) in the eyes-closed 
     state. The biofeedback program resulted in improvement in left 
     rotation, and the CVA was significantly improved after all exercise 
     sessions. In conclusion, a neck correction exercise program that 
     actively moves muscles may have a potential positive impact on 
     balance control ability. Biofeedback equipment might aid in enhancing 
     proprioception by preventing forward head posture (FHP).]

     AB: Purpose/. Objective: Stroke survivors' and their family 
     caregivers' (stroke dyads) coping during the inpatient period can 
     affect their short- and long-term health and well-being. This study 
     aimed to investigate whether survivors' and caregivers' psychosocial 
     factors (i.e. depression, anxiety, family functioning, and mutuality) 
     were associated with their own and their counterparts' perceptions of 
     family coping among inpatient stroke dyads. Research Method/. Design: 
     A cross-sectional design was adopted for this study which included 
     162 stroke dyads. Family coping, depression, anxiety, family 
     functioning, and mutuality were measured using the Family 
     Crisis-Oriented Personal Evaluation Scale,. Patient: Health 
     Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, General Functioning 
     subscale of Family Assessment Device, and Mutuality Scale, 
     respectively. The actor-partner interdependence model estimated by 
     path analysis was performed for the dyadic data. Results: The results 
     revealed that survivors' own (depression: β = −0.337, p < .001) 
     and their counterparts' (caregivers' anxiety: β = −0.220, p = 
     .021) psychological symptoms were negatively associated with 
     survivors' perceptions of family coping, whereas none of them were 
     associated with caregivers' perceptions of family coping. Moreover, 
     higher family functioning reported by the survivors (β = −0.375, p 
     < .001) and family caregivers (β = −0.195, p = .029) were 
     associated with better family coping perceived by both counterparts, 
     respectively. Conclusions/Implications: This study highlights that 
     stroke dyads' psychosocial factors play a vital role in their 
     perceptions of family coping. Future studies can be conducted to 
     develop coping-focused interventions from the dyadic or 
     family-oriented approach regarding psychosocial states as potential 
     targets for inpatient stroke dyads.]

     AB: Purpose/. Objectives: This study investigated attitudes that 
     young adults have toward individuals with amputation of the upper 
     limb (AUL). Previous studies have found that people tend to feel 
     sympathy toward these individuals, but they are also perceived as 
     less competent in various situations. However, it is unclear if these 
     perceptions are influenced by factors such as the cause of 
     amputation, the gender of the amputee, whether they use a prosthesis 
     or not, or the type of prosthesis. Research Method/. Design: The 
     survey included 469 participants from a university in the 
     Southeastern United States. Participants rated pictures of 
     individuals with or without amputation, and with and without 
     prostheses after reading a brief background scenario. Images were 
     rated using a semantic differential for competence and warmth, and a 
     scale of functional ability. Results: Factorial analysis of variances 
     produced significant main effects indicating individuals with AULs 
     who used prostheses were rated with higher competence and ability 
     than individuals with AULs who did not use prostheses. Females were 
     rated with lower competence and ability, and higher warmth regardless 
     of AULs status. Higher ability ratings were obtained for individuals 
     with advanced technology prostheses as compared to body-powered 
     prostheses. Conclusions/Implications: Our research shows that people 
     generally hold positive attitudes toward individuals with AUL when 
     they use prostheses. However, traditional stereotypes persist for 
     those who do not. Negative biases toward women should be accounted 
     for in disability stigma studies. The cause of amputation did not 
     influence ratings. Prostheses that appear to be advanced technology 
     positively influenced ratings of functional ability when compared to 
     traditional body-powered types.]

     AB: Purpose/. Objective: People with disabilities (PWD) generally 
     exhibit an increased risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and behaviors. 
     Underlying cognitive states, namely perceived burdensomeness, have 
     been identified as a contributor to the increased risk of suicidal 
     thoughts and behaviors in PWD. However, the role of body esteem in 
     the development of SI in this population remains unexamined, despite 
     its salience in other populations. In this study, we examined whether 
     the interaction of perceived burdensomeness and body esteem 
     contributed to the perceived likelihood of future SI among PWD, and 
     whether this relationship was further moderated by disability type. 
     Method: Participants included 119 adults with self-reported vision- 
     and mobility-related disabilities who participated in a larger study 
     focused on disability and suicide involving interviews and 
     self-report measures. We examined the interaction between perceived 
     burdensomeness and disability-related body esteem on self-reported 
     likelihood of future SI and whether this interaction was further 
     moderated by disability type (i.e. vision- or mobility-related 
     disability). Results: Greater perceived burdensomeness was associated 
     with a greater perceived likelihood of future SI only for 
     participants with vision impairments and at low levels of body 
     esteem. Conclusions/Implications: The combination of experiences of 
     perceived burdensomeness and low body esteem may be particularly 
     relevant to SI among people with vision-related versus 
     mobility-related disabilities.]

     AB: Purpose: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that 
     is chronic, progressive characterized by symptoms of relapsing 
     fatigue and pain. Despite evidence supporting the use of physical 
     activity (PA) for MS symptom management, low rates of PA 
     participation are observed. Previous research suggests 
     exercise-related cognitive errors (ECEs) can deter and decrease PA 
     participation. The purpose of this study was to examine whether ECEs 
     and self-regulatory efficacy for MS symptom control predict important 
     behavior-related outcomes for MS self-management (dependent 
     variables: PA, maladaptive behavioral responses to illness, and 
     perceived walking impairment). Method: Adults with MS (N = 110; aged 
     18 and over, with a patient-determined disease steps score of six or 
     less) completed the following validated questionnaires: ECEs, MS 
     symptom control self-efficacy, self-report moderate to vigorous 
     physical activity, behavioral responses to illness, and perceived 
     walking impairment. Results: ECEs significantly predicted behavioral 
     responses to illness (β = .459, p < .01) and perceived walking 
     impairment (β = .279, p < .01). The interaction between ECEs and 
     self-regulatory efficacy significantly predicted all three dependent 
     variables (βs ranged from .155 to .263, ps < .05). Conclusion: This 
     is the first study to demonstrate associations between ECEs and 
     different illness- and mobility-related perceptions for persons with 
     MS. Findings suggested that self-regulatory efficacy to manage MS 
     symptoms varied based on low, moderate, or high levels of ECEs. 
     Disability status is not easily modifiable; targeting social 
     cognitions, like self-regulatory efficacy or ECEs, may be a promising 
     way to promote PA for MS self-management.]

     AB: Purpose/. Objective: Acquired brain injury (ABI) is a leading 
     cause of disability in children and adolescents. Implicit biases 
     within pediatric ABI healthcare settings may exert negative effects 
     on clinical interactions and medical decision-making processes. This 
     study aimed to conduct a scoping review of current research that 
     examines the potential impact of implicit biases in such healthcare 
     settings for children with ABI. Research Method/. Design: Following 
     PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a search among five databases (CINAHL, 
     Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, PsycArticles, and PsycInfo) was conducted, 
     followed by abstract/full-text screening and data extraction. Main 
     characteristics of the included studies, including research design, 
     relevance to implicit biases, and public health impact were 
     synthesized. The risk of bias of included studies was assessed. 
     Results: Out of the 203 articles returned from the literature search, 
     a total of three studies met the inclusion criteria for the present 
     review. All studies examined the relevance of racial/ethnic biases 
     for evaluating abusive head trauma or nonaccidental trauma. The 
     included studies had an overall unclear to low risk of biases. 
     Conclusions/Implications: This scoping review identified scarce but 
     emerging evidence of the presence and detrimental impact of potential 
     implicit biases on the access and quality of care received by 
     children with ABI. More research is needed to examine the causes, 
     process mechanisms, and consequences of implicit biases in pediatric

     AB: Background: With the aging population, depressive symptoms and 
     impaired Activities of Daily Living have increased medical costs and 
     mortality, generating severe public health issues. This study 
     reconsiders the potential classification of depressive symptoms and 
     ADL impairment in older adults and identifies various factors that 
     may affect classifications. Methods: This study focused on 6270 
     Chinese adults aged 65 years or older. We used latent profile 
     analysis to explore depressive symptoms and ADL impairment (basic 
     ADLs and instrumental ADLs) in various subgroups of older adults. We 
     used Chi-square analysis and multivariate logistic regression to 
     examine the determinants of depressive symptoms and ADL impairment 
     among subgroups. Results: The study's results classified older adults 
     into three subgroups: those with high level depressive symptoms and 
     BADLs and IADLs impairment, those with moderate level depressive 
     symptoms and IADLs impairment, and those with no to low level 
     depressive symptoms and without BADLs and IADLs impairment. 
     Illiterate, having fallen in the past year, as well as having hearing 
     difficulties all predicted high level depressive symptoms and severe 
     BADLs and IADLs impairment. In contrast, regular exercise, contact 
     with friends, playing cards/mahjong, participating in organized 
     social activities, and visiting siblings predicted moderate level 
     depressive symptoms and IADLs impairment. Conclusion: This paper 
     discusses what is known about the various subgroups as well as the 
     treatment of depressive symptoms and ADL impairment in older 
     populations. It also gives policy and practice recommendations for 
     the future that may help rehabilitate and maintain the mental health 
     and ADLs independence of older adults.]

     for well-being programs for an underserved group; specifically, an 
     online adaptive yoga program with routine outcome monitoring 
     assessments has preliminary effectiveness in increasing mindfulness. 
     Consideration of such well-being programs alongside insurance would

     AB: Purpose: The Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis, 
     1992) is a widely used self-report measure of psychiatric symptoms 
     (Prinz et al. 2013), but it is longer than many screening measures 
     used in certain settings. Recently, a nine-item form of the SCL-90-R, 
     the Symptom-Checklist-K-9 (SCL-K-9), has been gaining traction 
     despite the limited research examining its psychometric properties in 
     the United States. The purpose of this study is to conduct a 
     psychometric evaluation of the SCL-K-9 scores in U.S. working-age 
     adults with psychiatric disabilities. Design: Six hundred and thirty 
     participants with self-reported psychiatric disabilities completed 
     the SCL-K-9 and other psychosocial self-report measures. Confirmatory 
     factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the SCL-K-9 scores' 
     dimensionality. Coefficient omega was used to assess the scores' 
     internal consistency. Convergent and discriminant validity were 
     assessed by examining the strength and direction of correlation 
     coefficients between the SCL-K-9 and other psychosocial measures. 
     Measurement invariance across sex, age, and primary diagnostic groups 
     was also examined. Results: CFA revealed a one-factor solution with 
     satisfactory reliability (coefficient omega = .828). Convergent 
     validity was supported by the relatively high correlation 
     coefficients between the SCL-K-9 with neuroticism, self-stigma, and 
     psychiatric disability acceptance, and discriminant validity by 
     relatively low correlation coefficients with perceived social stigma 
     and hope. Full measurement invariance for sex and partial invariance 
     for diagnostic groups was supported. Conclusions: Overall, this study 
     provides preliminary reliability and validity evidence for the 
     SCL-K-9 scores among U.S. working-age adults with psychiatric 
     disabilities. Further investigation is warranted to support its use 
     for research and treatment progress monitoring in recovery-oriented 
     care.]

     AB: Purpose/. Objective: U.S. health organizations, including 
     Division 22 of the American Psychological Association, the Society 
     for Critical Care Medicine, and the American Thoracic Society 
     advocate for psychological treatment that improves long-term outcomes 
     in critical illness survivors. However, limited information exists 
     with regard to psychology training opportunities in intensive care 
     settings. We aim to identify and describe (a) existing psychology 
     programs with training in intensive care settings and (b) barriers to 
     finding these training opportunities. Research Method/. Design: Using 
     aspects of the Arksey and O'Malley Framework and Preferred Reporting 
     Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping 
     Reviews reporting checklist as guides, two independent reviewers 
     searched the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship 
     Centers (APPIC) Directory and Universal Psychology Postdoctoral 
     Directory (UPPD) to identify programs with training experiences in 
     intensive care settings. Results: Searching the APPIC Directory did 
     not reliably or accurately identify training opportunities in 
     intensive care settings. Thus, only programs identified in the more 
     reliable UPPD search were considered for inclusion. After duplicates 
     were removed, searches using the UPPD yielded 31 programs for review. 
     Of those, 22 programs met inclusion, offering heterogeneous training 
     in intensive care settings. Conclusions/Implications: These results 
     suggest few opportunities exist for psychology training in intensive 
     care settings and available opportunities are difficult to identify 
     using standard search methods. The identified challenges also 
     emphasize the need for advanced search features for training 
     opportunities within APPIC/UPPD and/or a list of programs offering 
     these training opportunities. Our results highlight the importance of 
     program descriptions that accurately and comprehensively reflect 
     training opportunities-particularly relating to opportunities in 
     intensive care settings.]

     AB: Objective: To examine the value of including an open label phase 
     after a clinical trial of pain treatments by examining participant 
     characteristics and potential benefits. Method: Secondary data 
     analysis. Veterans with chronic pain who completed a randomized 
     controlled trial (RCT) comparing hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, 
     and pain education were invited to participate in an open label 
     phase. Average and worst pain intensities, pain interference, and 
     depression were assessed pre- and postopen label phase; global 
     impressions of change and treatment satisfaction were assessed at 
     postopen label phase only. Results: Of those who were offered the 
     open label phase, 40% (n = 68) enrolled. Enrollees were likely to be 
     older, to have attended more sessions in the RCT, to be satisfied 
     with their first treatment, and to perceive improvement in their 
     ability to manage pain after the RCT. In the open label phase, 
     depression and worst pain decreased across all three treatment 
     conditions. No other improvements were observed. However, most 
     Veterans perceived improvements in pain intensity, ability to manage 
     pain, and pain interference, and were satisfied with the second 
     intervention. Conclusions: There appears to be some value to adding 
     an open label phase to the end of a trial of pain treatments. A 
     substantial portion of study participants elected to participate and 
     reported it to be beneficial. Exploring data from an open label phase 
     can illuminate important aspects of patient experience, barriers to 
     and facilitators of care, as well as treatment preferences.]

     AB: Background: Although surgery is the gold standard following a hip 
     fracture, the potential for rehabilitation and survival rates are low 
     in frail older patients. Some patients may derive more benefit from 
     palliative care. The objectives of this review were to identify the 
     available strategies to improve end-of-life decision-making and 
     palliative care for frail patients with hip fractures and to 
     synthetise their level of support. Methods: We conducted a scoping 
     review of the scientific and grey literature, searching seven 
     databases and websites of associations. We included all study 
     designs, expert opinion articles and clinical practice guidelines 
     (CPGs). Data were synthetised according to the Approach to Patient 
     with Limited Life Expectancy and Hip Fracture framework. The number 
     of research items and their level of evidence were tabulated for each 
     of the recommended strategies. Results: Of the 10 591 items 
     identified, 34 were eligible. The majority of included articles were 
     original research studies (n = 15). Half of the articles and CPGs 
     focused on intervention categories (55%) such as goals of care 
     discussion and comfort care, followed by factors to consider in the 
     end-of-life decision-making process (25%) and prognosis assessments 
     (20%), mainly through the estimation of life expectancy. The level of 
     evidence for these strategies remains low, given the limited number 
     of prospective studies supporting them. Conclusions: This scoping 
     review highlighted that end-of-life care in frail older patients with 
     a hip fracture remains understudied. The strategies identified could 
     be prioritised for future research to improve the well-being of the 
     target population while promoting sustainable resource management.]

     AB: Despite China's enduring historical connection with mindfulness 
     and the growing recognition of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) 
     in Western education, mindfulness remains relatively underexplored in 
     the Chinese education system. This study addresses the scarcity of 
     resources and certified instructors in China by assessing the 
     effectiveness of MBIs in both taught and self-help forms in improving 
     well-being and prosocial behavior and regulating negative emotions 
     and behaviors among Chinese adolescents. The analysis included 362 
     Chinese students (mean age = 13.03, SD = 0.50, 47.5% girls) from 12 
     classes, assigned to the taught MBI group (N = 129, post), self-help 
     MBI group (N = 116, post), or control group (N = 117, post). 
     Paired-sample t-tests and multi-level modeling were used, accounting 
     for data nesting and incorporating gender, whether students live in 
     school, and age as covariates. Results revealed a significantly 
     greater improvement in well-being in the taught group compared with 
     the control, with both MBI groups demonstrating increased prosocial 
     behavior. While the taught group showed a significant decrease in 
     loneliness, it was accompanied by an increase in internalizing 
     problems. Coping strategies varied across the groups, with no 
     significant changes in depression, anxiety, and stress levels. These 
     findings imply the potential value of integrating MBIs into the 
     Chinese educational system, especially given the self-help approach's 
     favorable outcomes.]

     AB: Understanding of the exact trajectories of mood improvements 
     during mindfulness practice helps to optimize mindfulness-based 
     interventions. The Mindfulness-to-Meaning model expects mood 
     improvements to be linear, incremental, and cumulative. Our findings 
     align with this expectation. We used multilevel growth curve models 
     to analyze daily changes in positive mood reported by 190 Polish 
     participants during 42 days of a mobile-app-supported, 
     mindfulness-based intervention. The daily positive mood increased 
     among 83.68% of participants. Participants who started the training 
     reported worse mood improved more and faster than participants with 
     better mood at the baseline. Dispositional mindfulness and narcissism 
     - individual difference variables associated with high vs. low 
     emotion regulation ability, respectively - were not associated with 
     mood improvement trajectories. A small group of participants (16.32%) 
     showed a steady decline in positive mood during the intervention. The 
     results underscore the importance of a more comprehensive 
     understanding of individual variability in benefiting from 
     mindfulness-based interventions.]

     AB: Research has suggested that daily cognitive reappraisal and 
     mindfulness are differentially associated with emotional experience. 
     Nevertheless, the different relationship between these two emotion 
     regulation strategies and emotional experience remains unexplored 
     amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were facing unprecedented 
     challenges and disruptions in their everyday lives. The current study 
     aimed to examine the potential unidirectional or bidirectional 
     relations between two strategies and daily emotional experience 
     during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether the associations between the 
     two strategies and emotional experience varied. A total of 184 
     college students participated in this study. Daily positive 
     reappraisal, mindful attention and awareness (MAA), positive and 
     negative affect, and COVID-19-related stress were assessed utilizing 
     experience sampling method (three times a day for 14 consecutive 
     days). Results suggested that the directionality of the link between 
     the two strategies and daily emotional experience differed. The links 
     between positive reappraisal and positive affect, negative affect, 
     and COVID-19-related stress were transactional. However, a 
     unidirectional relation was observed between positive affect and 
     subsequent MAA. The study provided support for the contextual 
     perspective of emotion regulation by demonstrating that the efficacy 
     of regulation strategies is contingent upon the context. The 
     identification of optimal conditions for effective strategies remains 
     a crucial area for future research.]

     AB: The positive association between meaning in life (MIL) and 
     mindfulness has been supported; however, previous research has been 
     limited to the trait level. To explore the dynamics of mindfulness 
     and MIL in the state level, the present study used the experience 
     sampling method (ESM) and conducted a dynamic structural equation 
     model (DSEM). In addition, we examined the moderation of baseline 
     depression in this dynamic relationship and the protective role of 
     the dynamics on depression. We recruited 184 college students (Mage = 
     21.58, 33.15% male), who reported three times a day for 14 
     consecutive days, and analyzed the 7726 collected responses. Firstly, 
     a virtuous cycle between mindfulness and MIL was proven. Besides, the 
     baseline depressive symptoms moderated the predictive of mindfulness 
     on MIL, suggesting state mindfulness gave people with more depressive 
     symptoms more meaningful in daily life. Lastly, the result also 
     demonstrated the positive prediction of mindfulness on MIL and 
     alleviated the worsening of depressive symptoms within 2 weeks. The 
     findings extended the relationship between MIL and mindfulness from 
     trait level to state level, enriching the self-determination theory, 
     and examined the unique effect of depressive symptoms in the 
     dynamics.]

     AB: Episodes of solitude (being alone and without social interaction) 
     are common in older age and can relate to decreased well-being. 
     Identifying everyday resources that help maintain older adults' 
     well-being in states of solitude is thus important. We investigated 
     associations of daily solitude with subjective and physical 
     well-being under consideration of time-savoring (i.e. attending to 
     positive experiences and upregulating positive emotions). 108 older 
     adults aged 65-92 years (M = 73.11, SD = 5.93; 58% women; 85% born in 
     Switzerland) took part in an app-based daily diary study in 2022. 
     Over 14 consecutive days, participants reported daily solitude, 
     time-savoring, depressive mood, loneliness, and somatic symptoms in 
     an end-of-day diary. Multilevel models revealed that participants 
     reported higher depressive mood and loneliness, but not higher 
     somatic symptoms on days on which they spent more time in solitude 
     than usual. Higher-than-usual daily time-savoring was associated with 
     lower depressive mood, loneliness, and somatic symptoms. Associations 
     of solitude with depressive mood, loneliness, and somatic symptoms 
     were weaker on days on which higher time-savoring than usual was 
     reported. Findings highlight the potential of everyday time-savoring 
     as a resource in older adults in the context of increased solitude.]

     in individual work practice were defined. The aim of the present 
     study is to evaluate the relevance and completeness of these eight 
     categories and to increase the clarity of the nomenclature and 
     definitions of each category. An international expert consultation 
     has been carried out for this purpose. Thirty-eight experts from 13 
     countries participated. Data collection was conducted using a survey 
     design comprising structured questions. Consensus was reached if 75% 
     of the experts answered 'Strongly agree' or 'Agree' on a 5-point 
     Likert scale. For the topic 'Relevance', there was consensus for six 
     of the eight categories (range 78%-86%), the exceptions were the 
     categories: 'Exercising' (72%) and 'Professional manners' (64%). With 
     regard to the topic 'Nomenclature', consensus was reached for six 
     categories and for the topic 'Definition' this was five categories. 
     The present definitions have been improved based on the expert 
     recommendations. With respect to the topic 'Completeness': although a 
     limited number of suggestions were given, this did not lead to one or 
     more categories being added to the existing eight categories. The 
     final 'Nomenclature' for the categories is: 'Variation', 
     'Professional behaviour', 'Motoric skills', 'Vocational working 
     techniques', 'Physical workplace', 'Physical training', 'Assistive 
     devices and tools' and 'Task content and task organisation'. This 
     expert consultation has provided a solid basis for endorsing the 
     categorisation of interventions in IWP and is an important step in 
     building a framework to develop and evaluate interventions in IWP.]

     attitudes and stress levels relating to feeding their children and 
     the eating behaviours of the children. The secondary purpose of the 
     study is to evaluate the satisfaction of the participants of this 
     program. Twenty-nine mothers of children aged 3-6 years, experiencing 
     feeding issues, were randomly allocated to either an intervention or 
     control group. Background: Feeding problems including selective 
     eating, loss of appetite, and mealtime behaviour problems are 
     prevalent during childhood. Parents play a fundamental role in 
     acquiring knowledge about feeding. Problems in the feeding process 
     may lead to parental stress, feelings of despair, and incorrect 
     attitudes. Results: The mothers in the research group participated in 
     the 4-week training. Results indicated positive effects on both 
     maternal attitudes and their children's eating behaviours (p < 0.05). 
     No significant change was found in mothers' state and trait anxiety 
     levels (p > 0.05). Participants were asked to score their 
     satisfaction level with the program between 1 and 10, and the average 
     of the scores was 9.78 ± 0.42. Conclusion: This study shows that 
     online group education for mothers can support existing treatments 
     and guide clinicians working with children with feeding problems.]

     hypothesized that there would be significantly different, yet 
     moderately correlated engagement ratings for children and their 
     parents. Results: There was evidence of moderate test-retest 
     reliability for the child ratings, indicative of dynamicity across 
     occasions, but also a degree of consistency, as aligned with our 
     expectations. Service providers' ratings of parent and child 
     engagement were not significantly correlated and paired t-tests 
     indicated significantly higher engagement scores for parents than 
     children. Conclusions: The study provides preliminary evidence to 
     support the reliability and validity of the PRIME-SP as a tool for 
     service providers to document, reflect on and monitor child and/or 
     parent engagement.]

     AB: Objectives: The present study aimed to determine whether 
     religious coping mediates the relationship between parenting sense of 
     competence (PSOC) and post-traumatic growth (PTG). Method: 
     Cross-sectional research design was used. A sample of 74 mothers (age 
     range; 20-45 years) of CP children (age range; 2-9 years) was 
     collected through purposive sampling from different physiotherapy 
     centres and special education schools of Lahore. PSOC scale, brief 
     RCOPE and PTG inventory were used. Results: Positive religious coping 
     partially mediated (β = 0.190, 95% CI [0.026, 0.374], p < 0.05) 
     between PSOC and PTG. Partial mediation exists between PSOC and 
     appreciation of life through pathway of positive religious coping (β 
     = 0.040, 95% CI [0.007, 0.075], p < 05). Full mediation exists 
     between PSOC and personal strength through pathway of positive 
     religious coping (β = 0.041, 95% CI [0.001, 0.081], p < 0.05) and 
     through negative religious coping (β = 0.034, 95% CI [0.002, 0.066], 
     p < 0.05). Positive religious coping fully mediated (β = 0.029, 95% 
     CI [0.007, 0.058], p < 0.05) between PSOC and spiritual change. 
     Moreover, indirect effect of PSOC on relating to others and new 
     possibilities through positive and negative religious coping was 
     non-significant, indicating no mediation. Conclusion: Positive 
     religious coping affected the association between PSOC and PTG, that 
     is, mothers of CP children having high parenting competence are more 
     likely to use positive religious coping strategies that results in 
     more PTG.]

     AB: Background: Altered gait could influence knee joint moment 
     magnitudes and cumulative damage over time. Gait modifications have 
     been shown to reduce knee loading in people with knee osteoarthritis 
     during walking, although this has not been explored in multiple daily 
     activities. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of 
     different foot orientations on knee loading during multiple daily 
     activities in people with and without knee osteoarthritis. Methods: 
     Thirty people with knee osteoarthritis and twenty-nine without 
     (control) performed walking, stair ambulation and sit-to-stand across 
     a range of foot progression angles (neutral, toe-in, toe-out and 
     preferred). Peak knee adduction moment, knee adduction moment impulse 
     and knee pain were compared across a continuous range of foot 
     orientations, between activities, and groups. Findings: Increased 
     foot progression angle (more toe-in) reduced 1st peak knee adduction 
     moment across all activities in both knee osteoarthritis and control 
     (P < 0.001). There was a greater reduction in knee adduction moment 
     in the control group during walking and stair ambulation (P ≤ 
     0.006), where the knee osteoarthritis group already walked preferably 
     less toe-out than the control group. Under preferred condition, stair 
     descent had the greatest knee loading and knee pain compared to other 
     activities. Interpretation: Although increased foot progression angle 
     (toward toe-in) appeared to be more effective in reducing knee 
     loading for all activities, toe-in modification might not benefit 
     stair ambulation. Future gait modification should likely be 
     personalised to each patient considering the individual difference in 
     preferred gait and knee alignment required to shift the loading 
     medially or laterally.]

     AB: Background: Carbon-fiber custom dynamic orthoses are used to 
     improve gait and limb function following lower limb trauma in 
     specialty centers. However, the effects of commercially available 
     orthoses on center of pressure progression and patient perception of 
     orthosis smoothness during walking are poorly understood. Methods: In 
     total, 16 participants with a unilateral lower extremity traumatic 
     injury underwent gait analysis when walking without an orthosis, and 
     while wearing monolithic and modular devices, in a randomized order. 
     Device alignment, stiffness, participant rating of perceived device 
     smoothness, center of pressure velocity, and ankle zero moment 
     crossing were assessed. Findings: The modular device was 
     approximately twice as stiff as the monolithic device. Alignment, 
     smoothness ratings, peak magnitude of center of pressure velocity, 
     and zero moment crossing were not different between study devices. 
     The time to peak center of pressure velocity occurred significantly 
     later for the modular device compared to the monolithic and no 
     orthosis conditions, with large effect sizes observed. 
     Interpretation: Commercially available orthoses commonly used to 
     treat limb trauma affect the timing of center of pressure progression 
     relative to walking without an orthosis. Despite multiple design 
     differences, monolithic and modular orthoses included in this study 
     did not differ with respect to other measures of center of pressure 
     progression. Perceived smoothness ratings were approximately 40% 
     greater with the study orthoses as compared to previous studies in 
     specialty centers, which may be due to a more gradual center of 
     pressure progression, as indicted by lower peak magnitude of center 
     of pressure velocity with both study orthoses.]

     AB: Background: Knee osteoarthritis negatively affects the gait of 
     patients, especially that of elderly people. However, the assessment 
     of wearable sensors in knee osteoarthritis patients has been 
     under-researched. During clinical assessments, patients may change 
     their gait patterns under the placebo effect, whereas wearable 
     sensors can be used in any environment. Methods: Sixty patients with 
     knee osteoarthritis and 20 control subjects were included in the 
     study. Wearing shoes with an IMU sensor embedded in the insoles, the 
     participants were required to walk along a walkway. The sensor data 
     were collected during the gait. To discriminate between healthy and 
     knee osteoarthritis patients and to classify different subgroups of 
     knee osteoarthritis patients (patients scheduled for surgery vs. 
     patients not scheduled for surgery; bilateral knee osteoarthritis 
     diagnosis vs. unilateral knee osteoarthritis diagnosis), we used a 
     machine learning approach called the support vector machine. A total 
     of 88 features were extracted and used for classification. Findings: 
     The patients vs. healthy participants were classified with 71% 
     accuracy, 85% sensitivity, and 56% specificity. The "patients 
     scheduled for surgery" vs. "patients not scheduled for surgery" were 
     classified with 83% accuracy, 83% sensitivity, and 81% specificity. 
     The bilateral knee osteoarthritis diagnosis vs. unilateral knee 
     osteoarthritis diagnosis was classified with 81% accuracy, 75% 
     sensitivity, and 79% specificity. Interpretation: Gait analysis using 
     wearable sensors and machine learning can discriminate between 
     healthy and knee osteoarthritis patients and classify different 
     subgroups with reasonable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The 
     proposed approach requires no complex gait factors and is not limited 
     to controlled laboratory settings.]

     AB: Background: This study experimentally validated a computationally 
     optimized screw number and screw distribution far cortical locking 
     distal femur fracture plate and compared the results to traditional 
     implants. Methods: 24 artificial femurs were osteotomized with a 10 
     mm fracture gap 60 mm proximal to the intercondylar notch. Three 
     fixation constructs were used. (i) Standard locking plates secured 
     with three far cortical locking screws inserted according to a 
     previously optimized distribution in the femur shaft (n = 8). (ii) 
     Standard locking plates secured with four standard locking screws 
     inserted in alternating plate holes in the femur shaft (n = 8). (iii) 
     Retrograde intramedullary nail secured proximally with one 
     anterior-posterior screw and distally with two oblique screws (n = 
     8). Axial hip forces (700 and 2800 N) were applied while measuring 
     axial interfragmentary motion, shear interfragmentary motion, and 
     overall stiffness. Findings: Experimental far cortical locking plate 
     results compared well to published computational findings. Far 
     cortical locking femurs contained the highest axial motion within the 
     potential ideal range of 0.2-1 mm and a sheer-to-axial motion ratio < 
     1.6 at toe-touch weight-bearing (700 N). At full weight-bearing (2800 
     N), Standard locking-plated femurs had the only axial motion within 
     0.2-1 mm but had an excess shear-to-axial motion ratio. 
     Nail-implanted femurs underperformed at both forces. Interpretation: 
     For toe-touch weight-bearing, the far cortical locking construct 
     provided optimal biomechanics to allow moderate motion, which has 
     been suggested to encourage early callus formation. Conversely, at 
     full weight-bearing, the standard locking construct offered the 
     biomechanical advantage on fracture motion.]

     AB: Background: Poor postural control has been reported in people 
     with Parkinson's disease, which could be explained by the changes in 
     muscular activation patterns related to antigravitational muscles. 
     This study aims to measure the muscle activation of antigravitational 
     muscles during balance tasks in individuals, with and without 
     Parkinson's. Methods: Sixteen (16) participants (9 with Parkinson's), 
     aged ≥65 yrs. performed 2 × 30-s trials of 4 balance tasks 
     (bipodal and semi-tandem opened eyes and closed eyes) on a force 
     platform (center of pressure measurement); while surface 
     electromyography measurements were obtained bilaterally on the 
     multifidus at L5, biceps femoris and medialis gastrocnemius. 
     Electromyography amplitude analysis was processed by the Root Mean 
     Square (250 ms window epochs) and normalized by the peak of 
     activation during the balance task, to determine each muscle's 
     activity level. Findings: The Parkinson's group reported lower muscle 
     activation than control across tasks (in mean for multifidus = 8%, 
     biceps femoris = 16%, gastrocnemius = 7%), although not statistically 
     significant. Parkinson's reported significantly poorer postural 
     control than control, mainly for the center of pressure sway ellipse 
     area (p = 0.016) from challenge balance tasks such as semi-tandem. 
     Interpretation: Poor postural control was confirmed in the 
     Parkinson's group, but not significantly associated by the changes 
     from muscle activation of trunk and lower limbs, during balance 
     performance.]

     AB: Background: The purpose was to explore quadriceps 
     electromechanical function (quadriceps latency) during gait after 
     anterior cruciate ligament injury as a predictor for radiographic 
     knee osteoarthritis 6-years after anterior cruciate ligament 
     reconstruction. Change in latency after preoperative physical therapy 
     was also examined. Methods: Quadriceps latency (time between peak 
     knee moment and quadriceps electromyography) was calculated before 
     preoperative physical therapy (2.4 [0.5-7.5] months after anterior 
     cruciate ligament injury) and after preoperative physical therapy in 
     24 athletes. Participants were dichotomized into osteoarthritis 
     (Kellgren and Lawrence grade ≥ 2) and non-osteoarthritis groups at 
     6-years. Forward selection logistic regression was performed using 
     z-score normalized quadriceps latency and demographics. A 2 × 2 
     repeated measure ANOVA was performed for quadriceps latency between 
     groups before and after preoperative physical therapy. Findings: 
     Quadriceps latency before preoperative physical therapy was the only 
     predictor of 6-year radiographic osteoarthritis (p = 0.014, odds 
     ratio [95% confidence interval] = 5.859 [1.435-23.924]). Time by 
     group interaction was observed for quadriceps latency (p = 0.039, 
     η2p = 0.179). In the osteoarthritis group, latency may reduce after 
     training (before preoperative physical therapy = 115.7 ± 20.6 ms, 
     after preoperative physical therapy = 99.5 ± 24.0 ms, p = 0.082). 
     Interpretation: Prolonged latency after anterior cruciate ligament 
     injury may predict post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis 6-years after 
     anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Latency may shorten with 
     preoperative physical therapy, yet athletes still moved on to develop 
     osteoarthritis. Quadriceps function may need intervention immediately 
     following anterior cruciate ligament injury for prevention of 
     post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis.]

     AB: Background: Those who undergo ACL reconstruction are at an 
     increased risk of suffering a second ACL injury. A suggested 
     rationale for the increased injury risk is sensory reweighting to the 
     visual system to compensate for a lack of somatosensory information 
     from the knee. Understanding this proposed visual reliance may help 
     clinicians improve return to sport outcomes and reduce the risk of a 
     subsequent ACL injury. Methods: Thirteen ACL reconstructed 
     individuals and thirteen matched controls completed two common static 
     postural control assessments under three different visual conditions; 
     eyes open, low visual disruption, and high visual disruption. Center 
     of pressure data was collected for 30 s using force plates. Static 
     postural stability was evaluated using the following: 1) root mean 
     square distance, 2) mean velocity, 3) sway area, and 4) mean 
     frequency. Findings: No significant interactions between group and 
     vision were observed. Significant differences between groups were 
     observed for mean frequency in the double-limb stance (p < .05). 
     Additionally, significant differences were observed for visual 
     conditions in both double-limb (mean velocity; p < .05) and 
     single-limb stances (root mean square distance, mean velocity, sway 
     area, and mean frequency; p < .05). Interpretation: The findings of 
     the current study suggest that ACL reconstructed individuals, who are 
     at least two years removed from surgery, do not rely on visual 
     information to a greater extent than controls during static postural 
     stability assessments. Stroboscopic glasses may be a cost-effective 
     alternative for rehabilitation purposes compared to the traditional 
     binary eyes open vs. eyes closed methods.]

     AB: Abstract: Background: Long-leg frontal radiographs of the lower 
     extremities are used to assess knee osteoarthritis. Given the 
     three-dimensional (3D) nature of alignment changes in osteoarthritis, 
     postural alterations in the femur and tibia extend beyond the coronal 
     plane (in-plane) to include the transverse and sagittal planes 
     (out-of-plane). This study investigates the impact of these 
     out-of-plane factors on in-plane knee alignment parameters observed 
     in frontal radiographs. Methods: A total of 97 osteoarthritic knees 
     in women were examined. Using a 3D-to-two-dimensional (2D) image 
     matching technique, we evaluated the 3D postures of the femur and 
     tibia in the standing position as viewed from frontal radiographs in 
     the world coordinate system. Statistical analyses were conducted to 
     explore associations between these 3D postures and 2D alignment 
     parameters obtained from frontal radiographs under identical 
     conditions. Findings: The femur exhibited a medial inclination of 
     2.7°, a posterior inclination of 3.9°, and an internal rotation of 
     4.2°, whereas the tibia showed a lateral inclination of 6.4°, an 
     anterior inclination of 6.7°, and an internal rotation of 6.7°. 
     Both coronal and rotational postures of femur and tibia influenced 
     the hip-knee-ankle angle, mechanical axis percentage, and medial 
     proximal tibial angle. However, only coronal factors of tibia 
     impacted tibial joint line obliquity relative to the floor. 
     Interpretation: Attention should be paid to the potential impact of 
     the out-of-plane postures of the femur and tibia on parameters 
     assessed in plain frontal radiographs of the lower extremities.]

     AB: Background: Severity of dyskinesia in children with cerebral 
     palsy is often assessed using observation-based clinical tools. 
     Instrumented methods to objectively measure dyskinesia have been 
     proposed to improve assessment accuracy and reliability. Here, we 
     investigated the technique and movement features that were most 
     suitable to objectively measure the severity of dystonia in children 
     with cerebral palsy. Methods: A prospective observational study was 
     conducted with 12 participants with cerebral palsy with a predominant 
     motor type of dyskinesia, spasticity, or mixed dyskinesia/spasticity 
     who had upper limb involvement (mean age: 12.6 years, range: 6.7-18.2 
     years). Kinematic and electromyography data were collected 
     bilaterally during three upper limb tasks. Spearman rank correlations 
     of kinematic or electromyography features were calculated against 
     dystonia severity, quantified by the Dyskinesia Impairment Scale. 
     Findings: Kinematic features were more influential compared to 
     electromyography features at grading the severity of dystonia in 
     children with cerebral palsy. Kinematic measures quantifying 
     jerkiness of volitional movement during an upper limb task with a

     Interpretation: This study provides guidance on the types of data, 
     features of movement, and activity protocols that instrumented 
     methods should focus on when objectively measuring the severity of

     tauopathies including primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS), 
     nonfluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, and corticobasal 
     syndrome; however, the significance and timing of this symptom 
     relative to others are not well understood. Whereas some accounts 
     associate yes-no reversals with other binary reversals (e.g. up/down, 
     hot/cold) and attribute the reversals to disturbances of selection 
     within the language system, others implicate more general inhibitory 
     control processes. Here, we compared clinical and neuroimaging 
     findings across 30 patients with PPAOS (apraxia of speech in the 
     absence of aphasia), 15 of whom had a yes-no reversal complaint and 
     15 who did not. The two groups did not differ on any of the language 
     or motor speech measures; however, patients who had the yes-no 
     reversal received lower scores on the Frontal Assessment Battery and 
     motor assessments. They also had greater hypometabolism in the left 
     supplementary motor area and bilateral caudate nuclei on 
     [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, but only the right caudate nucleus 
     cluster survived correction for multiple comparisons. We interpret 
     these results to suggest that the yes-no reversal phenomenon is 
     associated with cognitive abilities that are supported by the 
     frontostriatal network; more specifically, impaired response 
     inhibition.]

     AB: Hebb repetition learning (HRL) refers to neurodevelopmental 
     processes characterised by repeated stimulus exposure without 
     feedback, which result in changes in behaviour and/or responses, e.g. 
     long-term learning of serial order. Here, we investigate effects of 
     HRL on serial order memory. The present research aimed to assess the 
     reliability of new HRL measures and investigate their relationships 
     with language and reading skills (vocabulary, grammar, word reading) 
     in adolescents with intellectual disability (ID). A comparison group 
     of children of similar mental age with typical development (TD) was 
     also assessed. ID and TD groups were tested on HRL tasks, evaluating 
     test-retest and split-half reliability. The relationship between HRL 
     and language and reading was analysed after accounting for the 
     influence of mental age and verbal short-term memory. The HRL tasks 
     displayed moderate test-retest (and split-half) reliability, HRL 
     tasks with different stimuli (verbal, visual) were related, and we 
     identified issues with one method of HRL scoring. The planned 
     regression analyses failed to show relationships between HRL and 
     language/reading skills in both groups when mental age, a very strong 
     predictor, was included. However, further exploratory regression 
     analyses without mental age revealed HRL's predictive capabilities 
     for vocabulary in the ID group and reading in the TD group, results 
     which need further investigation and replication. HRL displays 
     promise as a moderately reliable metric and exhibits varied and 
     interpretable predictive capabilities for language and reading skills 
     across groups.]

     AB: Stroke often causes long-term motor and somatosensory 
     impairments. Motor planning and tactile perception rely on spatial 
     body representations. However, the link between altered spatial body 
     representations, motor deficit and tactile spatial coding remains 
     unclear. This study investigates the relationship between motor 
     deficits and alterations of anatomical (body) and tactile spatial 
     representations of the hand in 20 post-stroke patients with upper 
     limb hemiparesis. Anatomical and tactile spatial representations were 
     assessed from 10 targets (nails and knuckles) respectively cued 
     verbally by their anatomical name or using tactile stimulations. Two 
     distance metrics (hand width and finger length) and two structural 
     measures (relative organization of targets positions and angular 
     deviation of fingers from their physical posture) were computed and 
     compared to clinical assessments, normative data and lesions sites. 
     Over half of the patients had altered anatomical and/or tactile 
     spatial representations. Metrics of tactile and anatomical 
     representations showed common variations, where a wider hand 
     representation was linked to more severe motor deficits. In contrast, 
     alterations in structural measures were not concomitantly observed in 
     tactile and anatomical representations and did not correlate with 
     clinical assessments. Finally, a preliminary analysis showed that 
     specific alterations in tactile structural measures were associated 
     with dorsolateral prefrontal stroke lesions. This study reveals 
     shared and distinct characteristics of anatomical and tactile hand 
     spatial representations, reflecting different mechanisms that can be 
     affected differently after stroke: metrics and location of tactile 
     and anatomical representations were partially shared while the 
     structural measures of tactile and anatomical representations had 
     distinct characteristics.]

     impairment in children, yet its potential to achieve change remains 
     incompletely understood and probably underestimated. Understanding 
     'the difference neurorehabilitation can make' against a background of 
     neurological repair and recovery as well as ongoing neurological

     AB: Cerebral palsy (CP) occurs due to damage to the developing brain. 
     Although brain damage is not progressive, children and adolescents 
     with CP have impairments in the nervous, muscular, and skeletal 
     systems that can worsen over time. Limitations in daily activities 
     such as walking, running, jumping, dressing, and eating are also 
     observed. Participation in everyday activities may be harmed. 
     Therapeutic programs for people with CP have incorporated physical 
     exercise as an intervention strategy. Activities that increase 
     physical fitness are highly recommended for children and adolescents 
     with disabilities. Aerobic exercises that repeatedly move large 
     muscle groups for a prolonged period increase the heart rate. This 
     method of treatment has shown beneficial results for individuals with 
     CP. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether 
     aerobic exercise improves changes in body structures and functions, 
     activities, participation, and quality of life in these individuals. 
     Fifteen articles were reviewed that investigated the benefits of 
     different types of aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, treadmill 
     training, water activities and sports, running and jumping). Aerobic 
     exercise has been shown to improve cardiovascular fitness, gross 
     motor function, mobility, balance, and participation. However, 
     aerobic exercise did not result in benefits in muscle strength, 
     spasticity, gait, and quality of life. The variety of aerobic 
     exercise treatments used in the studies makes it difficult to 
     establish a specific protocol for children and adolescents with CP. 
     Furthermore, most of the studies analyzed included small samples and 
     the quality of the studies ranged from low to making them difficult 
     to interpret. Therefore, new studies with larger samples and of 
     better quality are still necessary.]

     AB: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are severe 
     forms of epilepsy that usually start during infancy. There are many 
     types of DEE, making each specific diagnosis extremely rare. Children 
     with a DEE typically have seizures that are hard to treat and that 
     impact their development and learning. Other symptoms may include 
     feeding difficulties, movement problems, and features on the autism 
     spectrum. In our study, 72 Australian caregivers of a child with a 
     DEE completed an online questionnaire about their quality of life, 
     specifically within the context of caring for their child. We found 
     that caregivers' quality of life: (1) varied widely and ranged from 
     an 'ideal' state to a 'high needs' state. However, caregivers most 
     often reported challenges in finding the opportunity to do activities 
     they enjoy and looking after themselves; (2) was related to their 
     perception of their child's illness. This meant that their quality of 
     life was lower if they perceived their child's illness to be more 
     life-threatening, or if they felt more emotional about their child's 
     illness; (3) did not appear to be related to how well the caregiver 
     accessed, understood, or used health information; and (4) did not 
     appear to be related to the caregiver's level of knowledge, skills, 
     and confidence in dealing with the tasks associated with having a 
     child with a DEE. Overall, our study showed that quality of life in 
     caregivers of children with a DEE varied widely. This suggests that a 
     diagnosis in itself is not the sole factor impacting caregivers' 
     quality of life. We found that quality of life was related to 
     caregivers' perceptions of how serious or life-threatening their 
     child's illness was, and how emotional they felt about their child's 
     illness. Providing caregivers with support that strengthens their 
     emotional health and well-being, and how they view their child's 
     condition may improve their quality of life.]

     database search. Two researchers independently screened eligible 
     studies. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of

     (p=.031) and caregivers with a high school diploma/GED who were 
     spiritual (p=.021) had lower CB. Lower CB was correlated with higher

     AB: Objectives: There exists a deficiency in a distinct understanding 
     of the intervention effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) 
     exercise therapies (Tai Chi, Yi Jin Jing, Ba Duan Jin, Liu Zi Jue, 
     Qigong, Wu Qin Xi etc.) on cognitive function and its moderating 
     variables in the elderly. This study aims to systematically evaluate 
     the effects of TCM exercise therapies on the cognitive function of 
     the elderly and further propose the best exercise intervention 
     programme to delay the cognitive decline of the elderly. Methods: 
     PubMed, EBSCO host, Web of Science, EMbase, China National Knowledge 
     Infrastructure and Wan Fang databases were searched for the effects 
     of TCM exercise therapies on the cognitive function in older adults 
     until July 2022. A meta-analysis of the included literature was 
     performed using Stata 12.0 software, with a subgroup analysis of 
     seven moderating variables: subject type, intervention content, 
     intervention duration, intervention frequency, intervention period, 
     study type and sample size. A random effects model was used to 
     combine the overall effect sizes and to test for heterogeneity and 
     publication bias across studies. Results: A total of 20 publications 
     with 1975 subjects were included. The TCM exercise therapies delayed 
     cognitive decline in older adults (d = 0.83; 95 % CI [0.62-1.04]; P < 
     0.001). Subgroup analysis found that intervention content, 
     intervention duration, intervention frequency, and intervention 
     period were significant moderating variables influencing the 
     effectiveness of the intervention. Among them, the Ba Duan Jin 
     intervention (d = 0.85; 95 % CI [0.65-1.06]; P < 0.001), the duration 
     of each exercise session of 60 min or more (d = 0.86; 95 % CI 
     [0.71-1.00]; P < 0.001), the frequency of exercise of more than 5 
     times per week (d = 0.80; 95 % CI [0.64-0.96]; P < 0.001) and 
     exercise cycles of 6-9 months (d = 0.96; 95 % CI [0.80-1.12]; P < 
     0.001) produced the largest effect sizes. Conclusion: TCM exercise 
     therapies can effectively improve the cognitive function of the 
     elderly. The best effect on the cognitive function of the elderly was 
     achieved by choosing Ba Duan Jin and exercising at least five times a 
     week for at least 60 min each time for a total of 6-9 months. The 
     effect size of the TCM exercise therapy interventions on the 
     cognitive function in older adults may be overestimated because of 
     publication bias. In addition, large-sample, multicenter, 
     high-quality randomised controlled trials should be conducted to 
     validate this result.]

     AB: The study aimed to translate the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory into 
     traditional Chinese (GAI-TC), examine its psychometric properties, 
     and identify the optimal cutoff point. This research recruited 337 
     older adults from two community activity centers. Structured 
     questionnaires were used, including demographic information and 
     characteristics, the GAI-TC, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 
     (STAI). Cronbach's α of the GAI-TC was 0.93. The intraclass 
     correlation coefficient was 0.90. The content validity index was 1.0. 
     An exploratory factor analysis revealed that three factors in the 
     GAI-TC, including cognition anxiety, impact of anxiety, and somatic 
     anxiety, explained 59.46 % of the variance. The criterion-related 
     validity showed a significant positive correlation between the GAI-TC 
     and STAI, with an optimal cutoff of 9/10 for detecting anxiety in 
     older persons living in the community. The GAI-TC had good 
     reliability and validity and can provide professionals with a tool 
     for the early identification of anxiety among older adults.]

     AB: Objective: self-care is critically important for the long-term 
     management of heart failure (HF) patients, with caregivers playing an 
     important role in promoting self-care. However, adherence to 
     self-care is typically low among HF patients worldwide. Methods: 
     In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with individuals 
     diagnosed with HF. To structure the interview guide and underpin the 
     analysis, two established behavioral science frameworks, the Behavior 
     Change Wheel (BCW) and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), were 
     used in this study. Results: A total of 32 participants were included 
     (n = 16 patients, n = 16 caregivers), with themes involving: barriers 
     included: "Self-care with Limited Capability," "Insufficient External 
     Support," "Lack of Motivation for Self-Care." Facilitators included: 
     "Striving to Adapt to Disease Demands," "Adequate External Support," 
     "Positive Health Behaviors and Experiences.". Conclusions: Providing 
     positive support to heart failure patients and their caregivers, 
     along with cultivating intrinsic motivation for behavioral change, 
     can enhance self-care ability.]

     sociological, disease-related factors, exercise self-efficacy, and 
     exercise planning as influencing PA. Ordered logistic regression 
     showed significant associations between PA, exercise self-efficacy 
     (OR 1.093, 95 % CI 1.055-1.133, P < 0.001), and exercise planning (OR 
     1.296, 95 % CI 1.202-1.398, P < 0.001). Exercise planning partially 
     mediated the relationship between exercise self-efficacy and PA, 
     accounting for 64.86 % of the total effect. Conclusions: Multiple 
     factors, including sociological and disease-related ones, as well as 
     exercise self-efficacy and planning, influence PA in elderly stroke 
     survivors. Exercise planning partially mediates the relationship 
     between exercise self-efficacy and PA.]

     AB: Introduction: Poor quality of care and patient safety, adverse 
     patient outcomes, high rates of burnout and turnover, and increased 
     job dissatisfaction are all linked to uncontrolled stress among 
     nurses. Unmanaged nurse stress can lead to disorganized thinking, 
     decreased ability to focus and concentrate, and can put patients at 
     risk. The purpose of the integrative review was to determine the 
     effects of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program to 
     reduce the perceived stress levels of nurses. Research Methodology: 
     Included was a search of databases using key search terms and 
     inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant peer-reviewed articles 
     within the last five years were appraised to identify similarities 
     and differences. This paper discusses the implications of unresolved 
     stress on nurses and patients they care for including quality and 
     safety of patient care, cost of nurse turnover rates related to 
     stress, and poor work efficiency. Results and Discussion: Literature 
     results suggest that implementation of a mindfulness-based stress 
     reduction (MBSR) program leads to a reduction in perceived stress 
     levels among nurses resulting in improved patient outcomes, increased 
     job satisfaction, and reduction of organizational costs associated 
     with the hiring and onboarding process. Conclusions and Further 
     Recommendations: It is the conclusion of this integrative review that 
     implementation of a MBSR program leads to improvements in stress 
     reduction and indirectly positively impacts patient outcomes. It is 
     recommended that organizations implement a formal eight-week 
     mindfulness-based stress reduction program. MBSR Implementation 
     Resources: There are no conflicts of interest or financial gains for 
     the recommendations for MBSR implementation resources. These 
     resources are solely provided for additional learning and 
     implementation purposes. There are both free resources and for 
     purchase resources available that guides implementation and 
     operationalization of the MBSR program.]

     AB: Objective: Using machine learning techniques, we have developed 
     an interactive exercise training system to assist individuals aged 55 
     years or over with knee pain to perform lower-limb exercises to 
     improve their knee health. The system has three features: video-based 
     exercise demonstrations, real-time feedback on exercise movements, 
     and tracking of exercise performance and progress. The current study 
     aimed to evaluate the design of the computer prototype of the system, 
     and determine its usability and end users' intention to use it (i.e. 
     acceptance of it). Methods: Heuristic evaluation and end-user testing 
     of the computer-based prototype system were conducted. Three human 
     factors practitioners identified the design deficiencies, with 
     reference to 64 design principles. In addition, 10 individuals with 
     knee pain were recruited to use the prototype system to complete five 
     tasks in the study laboratory. We recorded and examined the task 
     success rate, number of requests for assistance, difficulties 
     encountered during tasks, and perceptions of usability and 
     acceptance. Results: Four design deficiencies were identified, 
     regarding recognition and recovery of errors, navigation, auditory 
     perception, and help documentation. Most participants had difficulty 
     in calibrating the camera and performing exercises. However, in 
     general, the prototype system was perceived as usable and acceptable. 
     Conclusions: The use of heuristic evaluation and end-user testing 
     revealed the capacity to systematically detect design deficiencies in 
     interactive self-help systems, allowing for effective system 
     adjustments. Moreover, our system shows potential for individuals 
     managing knee pain, but conducting iterative usability testing is 
     necessary to identify additional improvements. Furthermore, several 
     design propositions have been submitted.]

     AB: For older persons with delirium at the end of life, treatment 
     involves complex trade-offs and highly value-sensitive decisions. The 
     principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, respect for autonomy, and 
     justice establish important parameters but lack the structure 
     necessary to guide clinicians in the optimal management of these 
     patients. We propose a set of ethical rules to guide therapeutics-the 
     canons of therapy-as a toolset to help clinicians deliberate about 
     the competing concerns involved in the management of older patients 
     with delirium at the end of life. These canons are standards of 
     judgment that reflect how many experienced clinicians already 
     intuitively practice, but which are helpful to articulate and apply 
     as basic building blocks for a relatively neglected but emerging 
     ethics of therapy. The canons of therapy most pertinent to the care 
     of patients with delirium at the end of life are as follows: (1) 
     restoration, which counsels that the goal of all treatment is to 
     restore the patient, as much as possible, to homeostatic equilibrium; 
     (2) means-end proportionality, which holds that every treatment 
     should be well-fitted to the intended goal or end; (3) discretion, 
     which counsels that an awareness of the limits of medical knowledge 
     and practice should guide all treatment decisions; and (4) parsimony, 
     which maintains that only as much therapeutic force as is necessary 
     should be used to achieve the therapeutic goal. Carefully weighed and 
     applied, these canons of therapy may provide the ethical structure 
     needed to help clinicians optimally navigate complex cases.]

     AB: Background: Hospice care leads to improved patient and family 
     outcomes. Hospice use among older adults with end-stage kidney 
     disease (ESKD) is markedly lower than among older adults with other 
     serious illnesses, and the majority of those with ESKD who use 
     hospice enroll in the last days of life. Here, our aim was to explore 
     barriers to timely receipt of high-quality hospice care for older 
     adults with ESKD. Methods: Utilizing a qualitative study design, we 
     conducted a secondary analysis focused on hospice, a theme that we 
     identified in our larger overarching study that involved 
     semi-structured interviews with 20 nephrologists in the United States 
     focused on treatment decision-making in older adults with advanced 
     chronic kidney disease. We analyzed the interview transcripts using 
     emergent thematic analysis to develop an understanding of barriers to 
     high-quality hospice. Results: With a couple notable exceptions, 
     nephrologists voiced general support for the concept of hospice, but 
     few recalled patients of theirs who had received hospice. 
     Nephrologists' interviews revealed two interrelated contributors to 
     the lack of timely access to high-quality hospice care for seriously 
     ill older adults with ESKD: (1) nephrologists view dialysis and 
     hospice as mutually exclusive models of care; (2) nephrologists feel 
     unsure who should manage hospice care for patients with ESKD. The 
     first contributor was rooted in nephrologists' narrow vision of when 
     to consider hospice (informed, in part, by policy barriers) and, in a 
     couple of cases, strong discomfort with hospice. The second stemmed 
     from nephrologists' belief that neither they nor hospice are 
     adequately prepared to provide hospice care for ESKD. Conclusions: 
     Our findings suggest that, in addition to Medicare policy change, 
     nephrologists need to receive more training in primary palliative 
     care skills including in indications for hospice, initiating 
     conversations about hospice with patients, and collaborating with 
     hospice clinicians to care for these vulnerable patients.]

     AB: Background: End-of-life (EOL) care patterns may differ by 
     physician age given differences in how physicians are trained or 
     changes associated with aging. We sought to compare patterns of EOL 
     care delivered to older Americans according to physician age. 
     Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of a 20% sample of 
     Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged ≥66 years who died in 
     2016-2019 (n = 487,293). We attributed beneficiaries to the physician 
     who had >50% of primary care visits during the last 6 months of life. 
     We compared beneficiary-level outcomes by physician age (<40, 40-49, 
     50-59, or ≥60) in two areas: (1) advance care planning (ACP) and 
     palliative care; and (2) high-intensity care at the EOL. Results: 
     Beneficiaries attributed to younger physicians had slightly higher 
     proportions of billed ACP (adjusted proportions, 17.1%, 16.1%, 15.5%, 
     and 14.0% for physicians aged <40, 40-49, 50-59, and ≥60, 
     respectively; p-for-trend adjusted for multiple comparisons <0.001) 
     and palliative care counseling or hospice use in the last 180 days of 
     life (64.5%, 63.6%, 61.9%, and 60.8%; p-for-trend <0.001). Similarly, 
     physicians' younger age was associated with slightly lower 
     proportions of emergency department visits (57.4%, 57.0%, 57.4%, and 
     58.1%; p-for-trend <0.001), hospital admissions (51.2%, 51.1%, 51.4%, 
     and 52.1%; p-for-trend <0.001), intensive care unit admissions 
     (27.8%, 27.9%, 28.2%, and 28.3%; p-for-trend = 0.03), or mechanical 
     ventilation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (14.2, 14.9%, 15.2%, and 
     15.3%; p-for-trend <0.001) in the last 30 days of life, and 
     in-hospital death (20.2%, 20.6%, 21.3%, and 21.5%; p-for-trend 
     <0.001). Conclusions: We found that differences in patterns of EOL 
     care between beneficiaries cared for by younger and older physicians 
     were small, and thus, not clinically meaningful. Future research is 
     warranted to understand the factors that can influence patterns of 
     EOL care provided by physicians, including initial and continuing 
     medical education.]

     AB: Background: Sex differences in stroke are well documented, with 
     females being older at onset, with more severe strokes and worse 
     outcomes than males. Females receive less comprehensive stroke unit 
     treatment. Similarly, older individuals receive poorer quality care 
     than younger ones. There is limited research on sex differences in 
     factors that impact 3-month poststroke functional outcome in people 
     older than 80 years. Methods: This register-based and cross-sectional 
     study analyzed data from two stroke quality registers in Sweden from 
     2014 through 2019. The study included patients aged ≥80 with a 
     diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Sociodemographic 
     features, prestroke condition, stroke severity on admission (National 
     Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]), stroke unit care, 
     rehabilitation plans, and 3-month poststroke functional outcome 
     measured with the modified Rankin Scale were analyzed. Ordinal 
     regression analyses stratified by sex were conducted to assess sex 
     differences in factors that impact poststroke functional outcome 3 
     months after the stroke. Results: A total of 2245 patients were 
     studied with the majority (59.2%) being females. Females experienced 
     more severe strokes (NIHSS median 4 vs. 3, p = 0.01) and were older 
     at stroke onset than males (87.0 vs. 85.4, p < 0.001). Females were 
     also less independent prestroke (69.9% vs. 77.4%, p < 0.001) and a 
     higher proportion of females lived alone (78.2% vs. 44.2%, p < 
     0.001). Males received intravenous thrombolysis more often than 
     females (16.3% vs. 12.0%, p = 0.005). Regarding 3-month functional 
     outcome, males benefited more from thrombolysis (odds ratio [OR] 
     0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30-0.83), whereas females 
     benefited more from thrombectomy (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.71). 
     Conclusion: Stroke care should be adapted to sex disparities in older 
     individuals, while clinicians should be aware of these sex 
     disparities. Further research could clarify the mechanisms behind 
     these disparities and lead to a more personalized approach to stroke 
     care of the older population.]

     AB: Background: There is growing recognition that healthcare should 
     align with individuals' health priorities; however, these priorities 
     remain undefined, especially among older adults. The Rehabilitation 
     Using Mobile Health for Older Adults with Ischemic Heart Disease in 
     the Home Setting (RESILIENT) trial, designed to test the efficacy of 
     mobile health cardiac rehabilitation (mHealth-CR) in an older cohort, 
     also measures the attainment of participant-defined health outcome 
     goals as a prespecified secondary endpoint. This study aimed to 
     characterize the health priorities of older adults with ischemic 
     heart disease (IHD) using goal attainment scaling-a technique for 
     measuring individualized goal achievement-in a sample of 100 
     RESILIENT participants. Methods: The ongoing RESILIENT trial 
     randomizes patients aged ≥65 years with IHD (defined as 
     hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome and/or coronary 
     revascularization), to receive mHealth-CR or usual care. For the 
     current study, we qualitatively coded baseline goal attainment scales 
     from randomly selected batches of 20 participants to identify 
     participants' cardiac rehabilitation outcome goals and their 
     perceptions of barriers and action plans for goal attainment. We used 
     a deductive framework (i.e. 4 value categories from. Patient: 
     Priorities Care) and inductive approaches to code and analyze 
     interviews until thematic saturation. Results: This sample of 100 
     older adults set diverse health outcome goals. Most (54.6%) 
     prioritized physical activity, fewer (17.1%) identified symptom 
     management, fewer still (13.7%) prioritized health metrics, mostly 
     comprised of weight loss goals (10.3%), and the fewest (<4%) were 
     related to clinical metrics such as reducing cholesterol or 
     preventing hospital readmission. Participants anticipated extrinsic 
     (access to places to exercise, time) and intrinsic (non-cardiac pain, 
     motivation) barriers. Action plans detailed strategies for exercise, 
     motivation, accountability, and overcoming time constraints. 
     Conclusions: Using goal attainment scaling, we elicited specific and 
     measurable goals among older adults with IHD beginning cardiac 
     rehabilitation. Priorities were predominantly functional, diverging 
     from clinical metrics emphasized by clinicians and healthcare 
     systems.]

     AB: Aim: To describe uncertainty in surrogate decision-making 
     regarding end-of-life care for people with dementia using Mishel's 
     reconceptualized uncertainty in illness theory. Design: Integrative 
     literature review using Whittemore and Knafl's approach. Data 
     Sources: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science were 
     searched using terms such as uncertainty/unpredictability, 
     decision-making/advance care planning/end-of-life care planning, 
     surrogate/family/caregiver/proxy and dementia. The search was 
     initially conducted on 28 September 2021 and updated on 31 July 2023. 
     Review. Methods: Through systematic screening, 20 research articles 
     were included in the analysis. Content related to uncertainty in 
     surrogate decision-making regarding end-of-life care was extracted 
     and analysed, focusing on the reconceptualized uncertainty in illness 
     theory. Results: First, surrogate uncertainty exists in various areas 
     of surrogate decision-making regarding end-of-life care. Second, 
     antecedents of surrogate uncertainty include numerous intrinsic and 
     extrinsic factors. Third, surrogates exhibited some negative 
     psychological responses to uncertainty but continually processed and 
     structured their uncertainty through certain approaches, leading them 
     to grow as decision-makers. Finally, research-based evidence on 
     surrogates' processing of uncertainty and shifts to new life 
     perspectives remains limited. Conclusion: Surrogates' uncertainty in 
     decision-making regarding end-of-life care for people with dementia 
     is well characterized using the reconceptualized uncertainty in 
     illness theory. Healthcare providers should help surrogates manage 
     their uncertainty in surrogate decision-making more constructively 
     throughout the dementia trajectory. Implications for the Profession 
     and/or. Patient: Care: The findings highlight the importance of 
     assessing how surrogates process uncertainty and gauging how to help 
     them process uncertainty and transition to new life perspectives. 
     Impact: This review contributes to healthcare professionals' 
     understanding of surrogates' uncertainty in end-of-life care planning 
     for people with dementia, especially what they are uncertain about, 
     what influences their uncertainty and how they process it.]

     AB: Aim: This study aimed to estimate the proportion of acute care 
     nurses witnessing end-of-life dreams and visions or having these 
     reported by a patient or relative, and to canvass their related 
     attitudes and beliefs. Design: A cross-sectional survey study was 
     conducted from February 2023 to May 2023. Setting/Participants: 
     Participants were medical and surgical nurses from a 200-bed acute 
     care hospital in metropolitan Australia. Results: Fifty-seven nurses 
     participated from a workforce of 169 (34% response rate), of whom 35 
     (61%) reported they had encountered end-of-life dreams and visions. 
     The nature of end-of-life dreams and visions encountered was similar 
     to those reported in previous studies by patients and clinicians. 
     Nurses generally held positive attitudes towards end-of-life dreams 
     and visions but identified an unmet need for education and training 
     on this aspect of end-of-life care. Conclusion: Our results suggest 
     that nurses in acute care encounter end-of-life dreams and visions in 
     a similar proportion to oncology and long-term care but lower than in 
     palliative care settings. Education and training regarding 
     end-of-life dreams and visions are needed to ensure the provision of 
     comprehensive, patient-centred end-of-life care.]

     AB: Aim: To explore the work of palliative care from the perspectives 
     of district nurses with a focus on the strategies they use to achieve 
     positive outcomes for patients. Design: An exploratory descriptive 
     qualitative study. Methods: A combination of group and individual 
     interviews using semi-structured interviewing were used to explore 
     district nurses' views of providing palliative care across two large 
     urban community nursing services. Results: Sixteen district nurse 
     participants were interviewed. Three key themes were identified: 
     "Getting what was needed" involved finding solutions, selling a story 
     and establishing relationships. District nurses sought ways to "Stay 
     involved" recognizing the benefit of delaying discharge for some 
     patients. "Completing a nursing task" was a way of managing time 
     constraints and a form of self-protection from having difficult 
     conversations. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of 
     understanding the contextual nature of the practice setting in 
     relation to the provision of palliative care. In doing so, it has 
     revealed the strategies district nurses use to overcome the 
     challenges associated with providing palliative care within a 
     generalist workload. Implications for the Profession and/or. Patient: 
     Care: District nurses experience a tension between managing high 
     patient workloads and remaining patient centred in palliative care. 
     Being task focused is a way of remaining safe while managing a high 
     volume of work and is not always a negative factor in the care they 
     provide. However, focusing on a task while at the same time 
     addressing other unmet needs requires a set of skills that less 
     experienced nurses may not have. Impact: Palliative care education 
     alone will not improve the quality of palliative care provided by 
     generalist community district nurses. The practice context is an 
     important factor to take into consideration when supporting the 
     integration of palliative care in district nursing.]

     AB: Aim: To investigate the decisional needs in Denmark of people 
     with kidney failure, relatives, and health professionals when 
     planning end-of-life care. Design: A qualitative interview study. 
     Methods: Individual semi-structured interviews were carried out with 
     people with kidney failure, relatives and health professionals from 
     November 2021 to June 2022. Malterud's systematic text condensation 
     was used to analyse transcripts. Results: A total of 13 patients, 10 
     relatives, and 12 health professionals were interviewed. Overall, 
     four concepts were agreed on: (1) Talking about end of life is 
     difficult, (2) Patients and relatives need more knowledge and 
     information, (3) Health professionals need more tools and training, 
     and (4) Experiencing busyness as a barrier to conversations about end 
     of life. Conclusion: People with kidney failure, relatives, and 
     health professionals shared certain decisional needs while also 
     having some different decisional needs about end-of-life care. To 
     meet these various needs, end-of-life conversations should be 
     systematic and organized according to the patients' needs and wishes. 
     Impact: Non-systematic end-of-life care decision-making processes 
     limit patients' involvement. Patients and relatives need more 
     knowledge about end-of-life care, and health professionals need more 
     competences and time to discuss decisional needs. A shared 
     decision-making intervention for people with kidney failure when 
     making end-of-life care decisions will be developed. Reporting. 
     Method: This empirical qualitative research is reported according to 
     the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) 
     checklist. Patient or Public Contribution: Patients, relatives, and 
     health professionals have been involved throughout the research 
     process as part of the research team and advisory board. The patients 
     are people with kidney failure and the relatives are relatives of a 
     person with kidney failure. For this study, the advisory board has 
     particularly contributed to the validation of the invitation letter

     AB: Aims: To explore the effectiveness of continuous home wound care 
     on patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Design: A 
     non-randomized parallel controlled non-inferiority trial. Methods: 
     Patients with Wagner grade I-III DFUs hospitalized in two distant 
     campuses of the same hospital were included. All patients received 
     infection treatment and wound bed preparation during hospitalization; 
     after discharge, patients in one of the campuses received routine 
     outpatient wound care, and those treated in the other received 
     continuous home wound care. The per-protocol analysis was performed 
     to compare ulcer healing indicators, knowledge, health belief, 
     self-management behaviour and medical expenses of the two groups. 
     Results: Between October 2021 and December 2022, 116 patients were 
     enrolled in the study; 107 completed. The home care was not inferior 
     in terms of ulcer healing rate and demonstrated significant 
     enhancements in the understanding of warning signs, health belief and 
     self-management behaviour. Additionally, the home care saved 220.38 
     yuan (24.32 UK pounds) in direct medical expenses for each additional 
     one square centimetre of ulcer healing. Conclusion: The continuous 
     home wound care enhanced self-management behaviour of the patients 
     and saved their medical expenses while not compromising ulcer 
     healing. Impact: This is to date the first study to conduct 
     continuous home wound care practice for patients with DFUs and 
     confirmed its safety and non-inferiority in ulcer healing, and 
     supported its superiority in improving self-management behaviour and 
     saving medical expenses. Reporting. Method: We have adhered to the 
     transparent reporting of evaluations with nonrandomized designs 
     statements and the corresponding checklist was followed. Patient or 
     Public Contribution: The patients and their primary caregivers were 
     involved in intervention design, we received input from them about

     young adults with Down syndrome. Methods: Forty participants with 
     Down syndrome (27 woman; mean age 21.4 ± 4.9 years) were recruited. 
     Data on physical activity participation were collected by self- or 
     proxy-reported questionnaires about attendance, involvement and type 
     of physical activity. Results: Adolescents and young adults with Down 
     syndrome participated in more organised than non-organised activities 
     (P < 0.05), more often (P < 0.05), but there was no difference in the 
     total time spent participating in these activities overall.

     2019-March 2020 and Controlled Early-Exercise Group (CEG), n = 167, 
     July 2021-April 2023). Both groups completed the test battery 
     (Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), Immediate Post-Concussion and 
     Cognitive Test (ImPACT), Vestibular-Ocular Motor Screening Tool 
     (VOMS)) during pre-season to provide a baseline and within 48 hours,

     p = 0.03, OR; 2.910) and 14-days post-SRC (PRG; 0.0 (0.0-1.0), CEG; 
     0.0 (0.0-0.0), OR; 5.914). Near point convergence was better at all 
     time points for the CEG. The CEG was 26.7 % more likely to have RTP 
     within 30 days, and 6.7 and 5.1 times more likely to have resumed 
     non-contact and contact academic activities by 4 days. Conclusions: 
     SSHeRT is safe, can be used within 48 hours of a SRC and may hasten

     Australia Survey in a cardiac rehabilitation population using 
     accelerometry as the reference measure. Design: Cohort validation 
     study. Methods: Cardiac rehabilitation participants with coronary 
     heart disease were recruited to a prospective cohort study. Over 
     7-days, 61 participants wore an ActiGraph ActiSleep accelerometer 
     (1-second epoch, 10-minute bout) and completed the self-administered 
     Active Australia Survey at baseline, 6-weeks, 6 and 12-months. Total 
     daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity from both methods was 
     compared using Bland-Altman plots and Spearman rank-order 
     correlations. Results: Participants tended to over-report 
     moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, with more active participants 
     more likely to over-report moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. 
     There was a good level of agreement between the accelerometer 
     1-second epochs and Active Australia Survey at all time points (mean 
     bias (ratio) 1.04, 1.16, 1.14, and 1.06, respectively), with 
     weak-moderate correlations (ρ = 0.3-0.48). Conversely, there was a 
     poor level of agreement between the accelerometer 10-minute bouts and 
     Active Australia Survey at all time points (mean bias (ratio) 6.78, 
     9.09, 6.35, and 5.68, respectively), with weak-moderate correlations 
     (ρ = 0.3-0.52). Agreement between the two measures did not improve 
     over time for both 1-second and 10-minute bout accelerometry data. 
     Conclusions: The Active Australia Survey may be an acceptable 
     self-report measure of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in 
     cardiac rehabilitation attendees when capturing any time spent in 
     moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The Active Australia Survey 
     may be useful to routinely monitor physical activity levels over-time 
     in Australian cardiac rehabilitation programs at both individual and 
     group levels.]

     AB: Purpose: Rehabilitation technology can be used to provide 
     intensive training in the early phases after stroke. The current 
     study aims to assess the feasibility of combining robotics and 
     functional electrical stimulation (FES), with an assist-as-needed 
     approach to support actively-initiated leg movements in (sub-)acute 
     stroke patients. Method: Nine subacute stroke patients performed 
     repetitions of ankle dorsiflexion and/or knee extension movements, 
     with and without assistance. The assist-as-needed algorithm 
     determined the amount and type of support needed per repetition. The 
     number of repetitions and range of motion with and without assistance 
     were compared with descriptive statistics. Fatigue scores were 
     obtained using the visual analogue scale (score 0-10). Results: 
     Support was required in 44 % of the repetitions for ankle 
     dorsiflexion and in 5 % of the repetitions of knee extension, The 
     median fatigue score was 2.0 (IQR: 0.2) and 4.0 (IQR: 1.5) for knee 
     and ankle, respectively, indicating mild to moderate perceived 
     fatigue. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the feasibility of 
     assist-as-needed assistance through combined robotic and FES support

     AB: Primary hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is a skeletal 
     muscle channelopathy most commonly caused by pathogenic variants in 
     the calcium channel gene, CACNA1S. HypoPP can present with attacks of 
     paralysis and/or permanent muscle weakness. Previous studies have 
     shown that patients with HypoPP can have impaired quality of life 
     (QoL). In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to describe the QoL in 
     patients with HypoPP caused by pathogenic variants in CACNA1S using 
     The Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life (INQoL) 
     questionnaire, a validated tool to measure the QoL of patients with 
     neuromuscular diseases (higher score, worse QoL). We showed that 
     muscle weakness and fatigue were the symptoms with the greatest 
     impact on participants' lives and that "activities", in the life 
     domain of the INQoL, was most affected by HypoPP. Furthermore, we 
     showed that the total INQoL score increased with age. Low QoL was 
     primarily driven by progressive permanent muscle weakness and not 
     attacks of paralysis, although half of the participants reported that 
     attacks of paralysis challenged their daily life. The results suggest 
     that special attention should be given to muscle weakness and fatigue 
     in patients with HypoPP.]

     AB: Background: Writing involves complex sensorimotor and 
     biomechanical processes that regulate pressure on the writing 
     surface. Researchers analyze writing to understand kinetics and 
     kinematics by evaluating temporal, spatial, and pressure aspects, yet 
     discerning writing surface pressure and pen-grip force remains 
     challenging. Aims: To compare handwriting kinetics (pen grip-force 
     and surface pressure) and kinematics (temporal-spatial) of children 
     with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) with those of 
     typically developing (TD) children. Methods and procedures: 
     Twenty-seven children with DCD aged 7-12 years and 27 TD children 
     matched by age and gender copied a 29-word passage onto a 
     computerized tablet. Temporal, spatial and surface pressure as well 
     as pen grip-force were measured with a tablet and a wearable device 
     respectively. Outcomes and results: The DCD group displayed 
     significantly longer total writing time, mean letter time, and 
     greater letter height, width, variance, spacing, area, and erasures 
     than the TD group. Although there were no significant between-group 
     differences in the surface pressure or maintaining pressure, the DCD 
     group displayed weaker grip-force, p = .01, with greater variance. 
     Conclusions and implications: The DCD group's weaker grip-force 
     dynamics correlated with reduced legibility, form, and prolonged 
     writing duration, revealing insights into handwriting mechanisms, 
     particularly grip force, crucial for effective clinical 
     interventions.]

     AB: Background: Parents raising children with Learning Disabilities 
     (LDs) often face multiple challenges and high levels of parenting 
     stress, especially in societies with intense academic competitions. 
     Mindful parenting (MP) is an emerging approach that brings mindful 
     awareness to parent-child interactions and is found effective in 
     reducing parenting stress in various parent populations. Aims: This 
     study examined the effectivenesss of an 8-week online MP program on 
     Chinese parents of children with LDs. Methods and procedures: A MP 
     program was adapted and implemented in an online format with 69 
     parents of children with LDs. A randomized controlled trial design 
     was used to examine the efficacy of the mindful parenting group 
     compared with a wait-list control group. Parenting stress, mindful 
     parenting and self-compassion were assessed pre- and 
     post-intervention. Outcomes and results: Compared with the wait-list 
     control group, the MP group participants showed decreased parenting 
     stress (d = 0.62, p < 0.05), improved mindful parenting (d = 0.63, p 
     < 0.05), and increased self-compassion (d = 0.61, p < 0.05). 
     Conclusions and implications: These findings support the 
     effectiveness of an online MP intervention in reducing parenting 
     stress and increasing mindful parenting and self-compassion among 
     Chinese parents of children with LDs. The behavioral and 
     intrapersonal aspects of MP are more amenable to improvement, whereas 
     the attitudinal and interpersonal aspects, particularly 
     non-judgmental acceptance and compassion towards the child, are 
     resistant to change. Future studies should explore strategies to 
     enhance these attitudinal aspects and interpersonal processes of MP.]

     focused on improving the quality of life of service users. We expect 
     teams to reciprocate supervisors' trust by reporting greater levels 
     of trust in supervisors and better performance. Method and 
     procedures: We tested this trust-mediated model with a sample of 139 
     supervisors (reporting trust in their teams), 1101 team members 
     (reporting trust in their supervisors), and 1468 family members 
     (reporting performance focused on quality of life). Outcomes and 
     results: Our findings confirmed a cross-level mediation process. 
     Supervisors' trust in their teams leads to teams' trust in their 
     supervisors. This trust at the team level in turn is positively 
     associated with organizational performance oriented to improving the 
     quality of life of individuals with intellectual disability, reported

     the PRISMA guidelines, this systematic literature review examined 
     peer-reviewed research that has explored QoL for deaf adolescents in 
     high school by using databases such as Science Citation Index, Scopus 
     and Social Science Citation Index in addition to some related 
     journals such as American Annals of the Deaf, the Journal of Deaf 
     Studies and Deaf Education, Ear and Hearing, and Deafness and 
     Education International spanning 14 years (2010-2024). By analysing

     meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials to investigate the 
     impact of Immersive VR techniques on the cognitive, social, and 
     emotional skills of under-18 children and adolescents with ASD. 
     Methods and procedures: Four databases were systematically searched 
     as per "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
     Meta-analyses" guidelines and assessed six RCTs for further analysis. 
     The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the methodological 
     quality of the studies. Outcomes: Pooled results favoured VR and 
     reported significant differences between experimental and control 
     groups concerning social skills (SMD:1.43; 95 % CI: 0.01-2.84; P: 
     0.05), emotional skills (SMD: 2.45; 95 % CI: 0.21-4.18; P: 0.03) and

     attain developmental milestones at later stages and are at higher 
     risk of developing psychological disorders and social withdrawn. 
     Aims: We performed a scoping review to summarize the mostly used

     life, functioning and participation of children and adolescents. In 
     addition, the main findings of the included studies are discussed. 
     Methods and procedures: We searched for papers assessing quality of 
     life, functioning and participation of children and adolescents with 
     visual impairment from 0 to 18 years old conducted between 2000 and 
     2023. Outcomes and results: In total, 69 studies met the inclusion 
     criteria and were included in the review. Child self-report, 
     caregivers-proxy and self-report questionnaires as well as interviews 
     were used. The results showed that quality of life, functioning and 
     participation are significantly reduced in children and adolescents 
     with visual impairment, and that the impact depends on different 
     factors (e.g. severity of the impairment, age). Conclusions and 
     Implications: Considering the significant impact of visual impairment 
     on quality of life, functioning and participation on this population, 
     it is fundamental to develop integrated and multi-dimensional 
     assessment programs that evaluate the impact of visual impairment on 
     those dimensions considering different contexts of life (e.g. family,

     secondary analysis of two studies, participants, aged ≥60 years 
     with COPD and 12-month fall history or balance issues were tracked 
     for 12-month prospective falls. Baseline balance measures - Brief 
     Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Brief BESTest), single leg stance 
     (SLS), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and TUG Dual-Task (TUG-DT) test - were 
     assessed using intra-class correlation (ICC2,1) for reliability, 
     Pearson/Spearman correlation with balance-related factors for 
     convergent validity, t-tests/Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with 
     fall-related and disease-related factors for known-groups validity, 
     and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) for 
     predictive validity. Results: Among 174 participants (73 ± 8 years; 
     86 females) with COPD, all balance measures showed excellent 
     inter-rater and test-retest reliability (ICC2,1 = 0.88-0.97) and 
     moderate convergent validity (r = 0.34-0.77) with related measures. 
     Brief BESTest and SLS test had acceptable known-groups validity (p < 
     0.05) for 12-month fall history, self-reported balance problems, and 
     gait aid use. TUG test and TUG-DT test discriminated between groups 
     based on COPD severity, supplemental oxygen use, and gait aid use. 
     All measures displayed insufficient predictive validity (AUC<0.70) 
     for 12-month prospective falls. Conclusion: Though all four balance 
     measures demonstrated excellent reliability, they lack accuracy in 
     prospectively predicting falls in community-dwelling older adults 
     with COPD. These measures are best utilized within multi-factorial 
     fall risk assessments for this population.]

     AB: Background: Previous research found that healthcare professionals 
     had low preparedness for palliative care. Thus, it is necessary to 
     explore healthcare professionals' self-efficacy. The Swedish 
     Self-Efficacy in Palliative Care Scale (SEPC-SE) evaluates readiness 
     in communication, patient management and multidisciplinary teamwork; 
     however, it should be tested on a larger population. Furthermore, the 
     constructs of the SEPC-SE should be compared to that of the original 
     SEPC. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the consensus between the 
     construct validity and reliability of the SEPC and the translated and 
     adapted SEPC-SE. Furthermore, it aimed to describe and compare the 
     self-efficacy of nurses and physicians in hospitals and explore the 
     associated factors. Methods: The nurses (n = 288) and physicians (n = 
     104) completed the SEPC-SE. Factor analysis with Cronbach's alpha 
     evaluated validity and reliability, and an analysis using the 
     Mann-Whitney U test compared self-efficacy and multiple linear 
     regression-associated factors. Results: The SEPC-SE revealed three 
     factors with high reliability. Education or experience in specialised 
     palliative care was minor, especially for nurses. Self-efficacy was 
     highest in patient management (nurses, median [md] = 74.57, 
     physicians md = 81.71, p = 0.010) and communication (nurses md = 
     69.88, physicians md = 77.00, p = 0.141) and lowest in 
     multidisciplinary teamwork (nurses md = 52.44, physicians md = 62.88, 
     p = 0.001). The strongest associations with self-efficacy were 
     education at work and advanced homecare experiences. In addition, 
     there were significant associations between years in the profession, 
     male sex, physicians and university education. Conclusion: The 
     SEPC-SE is valid and reliable for measuring self-efficacy. Nurses had 
     lower self-efficacy than physicians. Physicians were associated with 
     higher self-efficacy and had more education and experience in 
     palliative care settings, which may explain their levels of 
     self-efficacy.]

     definition and using model cases to conceptualise the defining 
     attributes of an end-of-life conversations with the older person. 
     Design: Walker and Avant's eight step approach to Concept Analysis. 
     Data Sources: Four databases were searched, including PubMed, CINAHL, 
     PsycINFO, and Scopus. A total of 339 publications were identified 
     with 30 papers meeting the inclusion criteria and put forward for the 
     final conceptual analysis. Results: The defining attributes 
     associated with end-of life conversations included (1) an ongoing 
     process of older person empowerment, (2) discussion's concerning 
     values and preferences concerning end-of-life issues, and (3) 
     maintaining an open dialogue between all concerned individuals. 
     Antecedents were associated with the older person is their readiness 
     to talk openly about death and dying. Consequences were identified as 
     having a better understanding of what death and dying may mean to the 
     older person in a more specific manner. Conclusions: End-of-life 
     conversations are vital in understanding an individual's values and 
     preferences at the end of life, and yet, the concept of the 
     end-of-life conversation has not been well defined in the literature. 
     End-of-life conversations with the older person encompass ongoing 
     discussions and maintaining open dialogue around end-of-life care 
     while developing strategies to promote individual empowerment in 
     making informed choices. Using a conceptual model, aides in 
     addressing aspects of end-of-life conversations and an acknowledgment 
     of the dynamic process of end-of-life conversations.]

     exercise (EX) program compared to a Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) and to 
     analyze the relationship between the differences in cardiorespiratory 
     fitness (CRF) and HRQoL domains in people with schizophrenia (SZ). 
     Methods: The SZ (n = 112, 41.3 ± 10.4 year) was randomly assigned 
     into a TAU control group (n = 53) or EX-group (n = 59, 3 days/week). 
     The 36-item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire assessed HRQoL and 
     the sleep quality analysis (accelerometry). Results: After the 
     intervention (20 weeks), physical functioning (∆ = 12.9%), general 
     health (∆ = 15.3%), mental health (∆ = 8.3%), physical component 
     summary (PCS) (∆ = 5.1%), and sleep efficiency (∆ = 1.9%) 
     increased (p < 0.05) in the EX, with no significant changes in the 
     TAU for any domains studied. There were significant differences 
     between groups whose EX showed improvements (p < 0.05) compared to 
     TAU in physical functioning, general health, PCS, and sleep 
     efficiency. A greater CRF was associated with better values in 
     physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, 
     vitality, and PCS after the exercise program in SZ. Conclusions: A 
     20-week supervised combined exercise intervention program for SZ 
     increased sleep efficiency and physical functioning, general and 
     mental health, and PCS scores. This could lead to a critical HRQoL 
     change from how they were to how they should be.]

     AB: Introduction: Individuals with acetabular dysplasia often report 
     hip joint instability, pain, and poor hip-related function. 
     Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is a surgical procedure that aims to 
     reposition the acetabulum to improve joint congruency and improve 
     pain and function. We aimed to examine the influence of presurgery 
     clinical measures on functional recovery following PAO and the 
     associations among clinical outcomes after PAO. Methods: We screened 
     49 potential participants, 28 were enrolled, and 23 completed both 
     study visits (pre-PAO and 6 months post-PAO). We evaluated 
     dynamometer-measured hip and thigh strength, loading patterns during 
     a squat and countermovement jump (CMJ), pain intensity, and 
     device-measured physical activity (PA) levels (light, 
     moderate-to-vigorous PA [MVPA], and daily steps). We used linear 
     regression models to examine the influence of muscle strength (peak 
     torque; limb symmetry index [LSI]) and loading patterns before PAO on 
     pain intensity and PA levels in individuals 6 months following PAO. 
     Additionally, we used Pearson correlation coefficient to examine 
     cross-sectional associations among all variables 6 months following 
     PAO. Results: Lower extremity muscle strength and loading patterns 
     during the squat and CMJ before PAO did not predict pain intensity or 
     device-measured PA levels in individuals 6 months following PAO (p > 
     0.05). Six months following PAO, higher knee extensor LSI was 
     associated with higher time spent in MVPA (r = 0.56; p = 0.016), 
     higher hip abductor LSI was associated with both lower pain (r = 
     0.50; p = 0.036) and higher involved limb loading during the squat 
     task (r = 0.59; p = 0.010). Lastly, higher hip flexor LSI was 
     associated with higher CMJ takeoff involved limb loading (r = 0.52; p 
     = 0.021) and higher involved hip extensor strength was associated 
     with higher CMJ landing involved limb loading (r = 0.56; p = 0.012). 
     Conclusion: Six months after PAO, higher hip and thigh muscle 
     strength and strength symmetry were associated with lower pain, 
     higher PA levels, and greater normalized limb loading during dynamic 
     movement tasks.]

     AB: Objectives: The review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses 
     is a scientifically important procedure for performing a qualitative 
     analysis of published works. Thus, the objectives of this study were 
     to systematically review the meta-analytic evidence verifying the 
     effects of resistance training on muscular strength and/or 
     hypertrophy in healthy adults and to address the quality of the 
     meta-analytic evidence (CRD42020188928). News: Systematic reviews 
     with meta-analyses that verified the effects of resistance training 
     on strength and/or hypertrophy in healthy young adults, published in 
     English, were searched in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane 
     databases. The searches resulted in 1915 references, and 19 
     references were included following the adopted criteria. The selected 
     meta-analyses investigated a total of 587 randomized controlled 
     trials - 159 evaluated strength, 160 hypertrophy, and 268 both 
     outcomes, involving 12,375 subjects of both sexes. Of the 19 selected 
     meta-analyses, 31.6% verified the effect size of muscle strength, 
     31.6% of hypertrophy, and 36.8% of both variables (strength and 
     hypertrophy). Moderate correlations were observed in the AMSTAR 2 
     quality assessment with the assessment of the quality of evidence 
     (0.64; P = 0.003) and with the year of publication of the studies 
     (0.57; P = 0.03). The GRADE assessment indicated very low to high 
     quality of evidence. Conclusion: We observed systematic reviews with 
     meta-analyses of fair to excellent methodological quality and very 
     low to high quality of evidence; recording the protocol and following 
     a standardized reporting plan for meta-analyses are fundamental to 
     improving the quality of these studies.]

     AB: Objectives: The global socioeconomic burden of T2D necessitates 
     effective strategies to improve self-care behaviors for proper 
     diabetes management. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of 
     wearing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device versus CGM 
     combined with regular exercise (CGM + EX) in promoting diabetes 
     self-care behaviors and glycemic control among individuals with type 
     2 diabetes (T2D). Equipment and methods: The study included 65 
     participants with T2D who were randomly divided into three groups: 
     control, CGM, and CGM + EX. The CGM group wore CGM devices for two 
     weeks, the CGM + EX group wore CGM devices for the same duration 
     while engaged in exercise prescription for 3 months. One-way ANOVA or 
     repeated measure ANOVA, where appropriate, was performed to detect 
     statistical differences (P < 0.05). Results: Following the 
     intervention, the Diabetes Self-care Scale (DSCS) scores in the 
     control, CGM, and CGM + EX groups were 67.1 ± 11.9, 84.8 ± 19.3, 
     and 112.7 ± 10.9, respectively. These results indicated improvements 
     in DSCS scores for both interventions, with the combined use of CGM 
     and exercise demonstrating greater enhancement compared to CGM alone 
     (CGM vs. CGM + EX, P < 0.001). Notably, the combination of CGM and 
     exercise was more effective in reducing 2-hour postprandial blood 
     glucose values compared to the use of CGM alone (6.4 ± 1.3 vs. 9.5 
     ± 3.0, P < 0.01). Conclusions: These findings highlight the 
     importance of combining CGM device with regular exercise into 
     diabetes management to enhance self-care behaviors, maintain glycemic 
     control, and reduce the risk of long-term complications associated 
     with T2D.]

     AB: Objectives: Provide an overview of research-derived insights 
     aimed at elucidating best practices for enhancing mobility in 
     patients with cancer throughout the entirety of the care continuum. 
     Highlighting the value of a multidisciplinary approach involving 
     various healthcare professionals to optimize mobility outcomes for 
     patients with cancer and the benefits of different approaches. 
     Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, 
     Scopus, Embase, and on Google Scholar using search terms, mobility, 
     exercise, cancer, nurs*, physical activity, pre-habilitation, 
     rehabilitation, best practices. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, 
     peer reviewed research studies, exercise, and physical activity 
     recommendations were reviewed to provide a comprehensive overview of 
     strategies aimed at enhancing mobility in patients with cancer. 
     Results: Twenty-nine references were included in this overview of 
     enhancing mobility in patients with cancer across the care continuum. 
     Conclusions: Evidence-based strategies prioritize enhancing mobility 
     for patients with cancer, aiming to boost physical functioning and 
     overall quality of life. Healthcare providers should consider each 
     patient's unique needs and limitations when implementing these 
     evidence-based approaches, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach 
     involving oncologists, surgeons, nurses, physical therapists, 
     occupational therapists, and other professionals to ensure 
     comprehensive and personalized care focused on improving mobility. 
     Implications for Nursing Practice: Nurses advocate for incorporating 
     exercise into cancer care plans throughout the entire treatment 
     journey, collaborating with healthcare team members to tailor 
     programs to individual patient needs. Working together as an 
     interdisciplinary team, nurses help develop an overall care plan that 
     emphasizes exercise as an important aspect of cancer care, using 
     their expertise to create customized exercise routines to encourage 
     and motivate patients to participate in physical activity.]

     and discuss their use in multidisciplinary research and clinical 
     practice. Methods: Data sources include peer-reviewed articles 
     sourced in electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL), government 
     websites, national, and international best practice guidelines to 
     describe frequently used mobility assessment instruments. Results: 
     Numerous clinician-, observer-, patient-reported, and performance 
     outcome instruments and evidence-based implementation program 
     resources exist, though these vary in their intended purpose and 
     setting. Wearable and ambient sensors provide new opportunities to 
     collect passive, objective physical activity data and observe changes 
     in mobility across settings. Conclusions: Selection among multiple 
     assessment tools requires consideration of the available evidence for 
     use in the desired population, the outcomes of interest, whether use 
     is feasible for the setting, and the strength of validity and 
     reliability data for the tool. Implications for Nursing Practice: 
     Nurses, especially in the inpatient setting, are typically in most 
     frequent contact with patients and are well-positioned to assess 
     mobility and ensure that safe, progressive mobility care plans are in 
     place. Development of an organization-wide mobility culture requires 
     a systematic, multidisciplinary approach and long-term commitment.]

     references were included in this overview of hospital-associated 
     deconditioning (HAD) in patients with cancer. HAD is a widespread 
     phenomenon with grave consequences. Patients with cancer are 
     particularly vulnerable to HAD due to their cancer diagnosis and 
     treatment effects. Physical activity in hospitalized patients is one 
     of the most important practices to prevent HAD and is achieved 
     through standardized mobility assessment and interdisciplinary 
     collaboration. Conclusions: Promoting mobility in hospitalized 
     patients with cancer is essential to prevent the complications of 
     HAD. Implications for Nursing Practice: Nurses are leaders of the 
     interdisciplinary approach to enhance inpatient mobility. As they are 
     most often at the bedside, nurses assess patients' level of mobility, 
     recognize risk factors for HAD, and implement safe mobility 
     interventions. Nurses experience barriers to promoting mobility 
     including workforce shortages, high workloads, and competing 
     priorities.]

     surgery, nursing care, and rehabilitation. Peer-reviewed research 
     studies, review articles, and pain guidelines and position papers 
     were reviewed to provide an overview on cancer pain, its impact on 
     mobility, and the nurse's role in managing pain and optimizing 
     mobility and functional outcomes. Results: Firty-two references were 
     included in this overview. This body of literature is replete with 
     studies on the management of pain; however, the tie between pain and 
     mobility has not been well described aside from the breakthrough pain 
     literature. This manuscript weaves these two important concepts 
     together to better inform nurses and other clinicians regarding the 
     importance of managing pain to even begin mobilizing patients, 
     especially following surgery and for other painful conditions. 
     Conclusions: Oncology nurses play an integral role in assessing and 
     managing cancer pain. It is important for nurses to recognize how 
     their pain management interventions lead to improved mobility and 
     functioning in patients with cancer. Implications for Nursing 
     Practice: Nurses comprise the largest workforce around the globe and 
     are well-equipped to assess and manage cancer pain in all cancer care 
     settings. As leaders within the healthcare team, making 
     recommendations to better control pain and communicating with other 
     team members regarding the pain plan is essential in improving 
     mobility in patients with cancer.]

     AB: Objectives: Cancer survivors often experience mobility 
     impairments that negatively impact their ability to engage in 
     everyday activities. Healthcare providers working with patients in 
     the continuum of cancer care play essential roles in identifying and 
     addressing mobility impairments. The objective of this article is to 
     present common assistive devices valuable in managing cancer and 
     cancer treatment-related mobility impairments. Methods: Peer-reviewed 
     scientific publications and expert opinions. Results: This article 
     highlights assistive devices commonly used in various settings of 
     cancer care and describes how they address different impairments 
     faced by cancer survivors. The information presented can potentially 
     serve as a resource when training clinical staff (eg, oncology 
     nursing staff) on device provision across all settings. The 
     information can also be useful for patients and caregivers to learn 
     about potential functional impairments linked to cancer and 
     treatments and assistive devices that can be useful to improve 
     patients' functional capacity and reduce caregiver burden. 
     Conclusion: It is essential to involve different team members to 
     identify and select the most appropriate assistive devices that match 
     the patient's functional needs and physical capacity and to train 
     them in device use so they can safely carry out their daily routine. 
     Implications for Nursing Practice: Oncology nurses are one of the 
     first providers to identify mobility impairments in cancer patients. 
     This article will help increase their knowledge in common assistive 
     devices valuable for addressing various mobility impairments 
     associated with cancer and treatments. With additional training on 
     device provision, oncology nurses will be more empowered to 
     collaborate with rehabilitation to identify potential mobility 
     impairments, initiate device provision, and encourage their patients 
     to work with therapy services. Ultimately this could reduce injuries 
     linked to mobility impairments and improve the patient's functional 
     independence and overall quality of life.]

     AB: Objectives: To describe changes in daily life mobility in 
     prostate cancer survivors treated with androgen deprivation therapy 
     (ADT) after a 6-month exercise intervention using novel instrumented 
     socks and to identify characteristics of participants who exhibited 
     changes in daily life mobility. Methods: A subset of participants in 
     a fall prevention exercise trial completed objective tests and 
     patient-reported surveys of physical functioning, and wore 
     instrumented socks for up to 7 days to measure daily life mobility. 
     Changes in cadence, double support proportion, and pitch angle of the 
     foot at toe-off were selected as measures of daily life mobility 
     previously found to be different in men exposed to ADT for prostate 
     cancer versus controls. Daily life mobility was compared from 
     baseline to 6 months using paired t-tests. Characteristics of 
     responders who improved their daily life mobility were compared to 
     nonresponders using two-sample t-tests, Chi-squared proportion tests, 
     or Fisher's Exact Tests. Results: Our sample included 35 prostate 
     cancer survivors (mean age 71.6 ± 7.8 years). Mean cadence, double 
     support proportion, and pitch angle at toe-off did not change 
     significantly over 6 months of exercise, but 14 participants (40%) 
     improved in at least two of three daily life mobility measures 
     ("responders"). Responders were characterized by lower physical 
     functioning, lower cadence in daily life, fewer comorbidities, and 
     better social and mental/emotional functioning. Conclusions: Certain 
     daily life mobility measures potentially impacted by ADT could be 
     measured with instrumented socks and improved by exercise. Men who 
     start with lower physical functioning and better social and 
     mental/emotional functioning appear most likely to benefit, possibly 
     because they have more to gain from exercise and are able to engage 
     in a 6-month intervention. Implications for Nursing Practice: 
     Technology-based approaches could provide nurses with an objective 
     measure of daily life mobility for patients with chronic illness and 
     detect who is responding to rehabilitation.]

     care; in some contexts, the advanced practice nurse (APN) has a 
     clearly defined role. This study aimed to define the possible role of 
     the APN within the interprofessional palliative care team in our 
     context. Data Sources: A focused ethnographic approach was taken 
     involving participant observation and semistructured interviews. 
     Conclusion: From the participant observations, interaction of the 
     participants, discussion content, and styles of meeting management 
     were described. From the thematic analysis of the interviews, 15 
     themes emerged, grouped into four macro-themes: interprofessional 
     collaboration, the interprofessional meeting, nurse's role, and 
     developments. Implications for Nursing Practice: The study has 
     identified current nursing practice within the interprofessional 
     palliative care team and areas where interprofessional collaboration 
     can be improved. These are both organizational (role definition and 
     team meeting management) and professional (development of nursing 
     culture, expanded nursing role, and introduction of the APN within 
     the team). Nurses must develop advanced skills to ensure more 
     effective care for patients and caregivers. The introduction of an 
     APN could be appropriate to address this need.]

     with a mobile application on the supportive care needs and quality of 
     life of women undergoing breast-conserving surgery. Methods: The 
     study was conducted in 81 patients. The experimental group received 
     mobile application and the control group received standard education. 
     Fisher's Exact Test, Chi-Square test, Student's t Test, Mann-Whitney 
     U test, mixed design analysis of variance and Bonferroni-Dunn test 
     were used to analyze the data. Results: While the pre-study 
     supportive care needs scores of the women were similar in the 
     experimental (85.37 ± 23.58) and control (83.13 ± 23.03) groups, 
     they decreased significantly in the experimental group at the 4th and 
     8th-week measurements (54.34 ± 27.28; 58.78 ± 16.51) (p < .05). In 
     the 4th and 8th week measurements, the quality of life of the 
     experimental group (72.26 ± 14.12; 71.04 ± 8.12) increased 
     significantly, while no significant change was found in the control 
     group (42.50 ± 14.38; 45.63 ± 8.28). Conclusions: It was found that 
     the supportive care needs of the decreased and their quality of life 
     increased after the education given to women with a mobile 
     application. Implications for Nursing Practice: This study ensured 
     that women who had a sufficiently intense and exhausting process 
     during the cancer treatment process could comfortably receive care 
     support and education with the mobile application at any time and 
     place they wanted. It also revealed that nurses can provide care and

     AB: Background: The global COVID-19 lockdown restricted daily 
     routines due to the psychological fear of infection, which imposed an 
     unknown universal threat on female college students, affecting 
     physiological health and well-being. However, scant information 
     concerning the efficacy of yogic practice on female college students 
     during the stressful COVID-19 pandemic situation is available. 
     Methods: In a randomized controlled trial (n = 74, age = 21.65 [4.05] 
     y), a study was conducted with a well-conceptualized yogic module for 
     5 days/week for 3 months (40 min daily in the morning) among yogic 
     volunteers. Pre-post analysis of anthropometric, physiological, and 
     biochemical indices in pandemic-stressed female college students was 
     done for the control and yoga groups. Results: After 3 months of 
     yogic practice, significant reduction (P < .05) in heart rate (d = 
     0.64, meandiff = 5.43), systolic blood pressure (d = 0.59, meandiff = 
     5.32), cortisol (d = 0.59, meandiff = 6.354), and triglycerides (P < 
     .01, d = 0.45, meandiff = 13.95) was observed. After yogic follow-up 
     significant improvement (P < .01) in high-frequency (d = 0.56, 
     meandiff = −7.3), total power (d = 0.46, meandiff = −1150) and 
     time domain parameters of heart rate variability led to ameliorate 
     the stress index. Superoxide dismutase (P < .01, d = 0.78, meandiff = 
     0.69), catalase (P < .05, d = 0.48, meandiff = −7.37), glutathione 
     (P < .001, d = 0.83, meandiff = −4.15), high-density lipoprotein (P 
     < .05, d = 0.48, meandiff = −11.07), and dopamine (P < .001, d = 
     0.97, meandiff = −135.4) values along with inflammatory markers (P 
     < .001) significantly improved among yogic volunteers after regular 
     practice. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a 3-month 
     well-conceptualized yogic intervention during COVID-19 may be 
     considered as a prophylactic tool to improve female college students' 
     universal psychophysiological health by ameliorating autonomic 
     functions, cardiometabolic risk factors, and immune metabolisms in an 
     economical and environment-friendly manner.]

     AB: Background: This study aimed to investigate the factors 
     associated with the time that community-dwelling stroke survivors 
     spent walking. Methods: We analyzed the cross-sectional data of 1534 
     community-dwelling stroke survivors from the Korean National Health 
     and Nutrition Examination Survey. Complex-sample logistic regression 
     analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with 
     insufficient walking time (<90 min/wk). The mean time spent walking 
     was examined according to age, sex, resistance exercise level, and 
     self-reported disability using complex-sample general linear models. 
     Results: Women (odds ratio [OR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
     1.0-2.3), current smokers (OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.8), insufficient 
     resistance exercise (OR 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.5), and those with rural 
     residences (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9) were independently associated 
     with insufficient walking time. The mean time spent walking was 
     significantly lower in older adults aged ≥65 years than in young 
     adults aged <65 years (200.0 ± 42.0 min/wk vs 287.2 ± 36.6 min/wk,

     min/wk, P = .027), and in individuals engaging in insufficient 
     resistance exercise compared with those engaging in sufficient 
     resistance exercise (203.2 ± 36.2 vs 283.9 ± 43.0 min/wk, P = 
     .008). The mean walking time did not vary according to the presence 
     of self-reported disabilities. Conclusions: Environmental and 
     personal factors are associated with insufficient walking time in 
     community-dwelling stroke survivors.]

     AB: Background: There is a scarcity of studies on the association 
     between physical multimorbidity and lower levels of physical activity 
     among older adults from low- and middle-income countries, while the 
     potential mediating variables in this association are largely 
     unknown. Methods: Cross-sectional, community-based, nationally 
     representative data from the World Health Organization Study on 
     global AGEing and adult health were analyzed. Data on 11 chronic 
     physical conditions were collected. Scoring <150 minutes of moderate- 
     to high-intensity physical activity per week was considered low 
     physical activity. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation 
     analysis were done to assess associations and quality of life 
     measures which might influence these associations. Results: Data on 
     14,585 people aged ≥65 years were analyzed (mean [SD] age 72.6 
     (11.5) y, maximum age 114 y; 55.0% women). After adjustment for 
     potential confounders, compared with no chronic conditions, ≥3 
     conditions were associated with a significant 1.59 to 2.42 times 
     higher odds for low physical activity. Finally, mobility mediated the 
     largest proportion of the association between ≥3 chronic physical 
     conditions and low physical activity (mediated percentage 50.7%), 
     followed by activities of daily living disability (30.7%), cognition 
     (24.0%), affect (23.6%), and pain/discomfort (22.0%). Conclusions: 
     Physical multimorbidity was associated with higher odds for low 
     physical activity among older adults residing in low- and 
     middle-income countries. Mobility, disability, cognition, affect, and 
     pain/discomfort explained the largest proportion of this association. 
     Given the universal benefits of regular and sustained participation 
     in physical activity, it would be prudent to implement interventions 
     among older people with physical multimorbidity to increase levels of 
     physical activity. Future studies should assess the impact of 
     addressing the identified potential mediators among people with 
     multimorbidity on physical activity levels.]

     AB: Background: Autistic children can benefit from physical activity 
     (PA) in a variety of ways. However, autistic children tend not to 
     meet PA recommendations and, consequently, may not experience the 
     associated benefits. Parental PA support can facilitate PA 
     participation among autistic children, but parents of autistic 
     children may lack the skills to help their child engage in PA. Few 
     studies, to date, have examined the outcomes of parent-mediated PA 
     interventions for autistic children. The purpose of this study was to 
     explore parents' perceived behavioral control (PBC) to support their 
     autistic children in PA after their participation in a PA 
     intervention. Methods: The theory of planned behavior served as the 
     framework for this descriptive-qualitative investigation. Fifteen 
     parents (each with 1 autistic child in the intervention) participated 
     in semistructured interviews (3 wk after the intervention), which 
     were transcribed and then analyzed using thematic line-by-line 
     analysis. Results: Three themes characterized the changes to parents' 
     PBC after completing the PA intervention. Those themes were: (1) I 
     learned by son! (2) You are my coach! and (3) I can do it!. 
     Conclusions: The results showed that by participating in a 
     parent-mediated PA intervention, parents experienced improved 
     confidence and awareness of their child's abilities, thus enhancing 
     their PBC. Future research is needed to examine how these 
     improvements in PBC may influence the actual PA behaviors of autistic 
     children.]

     AB: BACKGROUND: Wheelchair athletes, as a group of elite athletes who 
     participate in high-level sports activities, are constantly exposed 
     to musculoskeletal injuries and disorders due to their frequent use 
     of wheelchairs and overworked upper limbs. In this study, we 
     investigated the effect of elastic band exercises on the extent of 
     athletes' forward head angle, kyphosis, rounded shoulder, and pain 
     scores. METHODS: Twenty-six male and female wheelchair athletes with 
     spinal cord injuries (age: 27.11±6.67), active in table tennis, 
     basketball and pétanque, were selected and randomly divided into 
     either a control or training group. The Wheelchair User's Shoulder 
     Pain Index (WUSPI) questionnaire was used to investigate the level of 
     shoulder pain. A sagittal view photogrammetry method was used to 
     measure the forward head angle and round shoulder angle, and a 
     flexible ruler was used to measure the thoracic kyphosis angle. For 
     our statistical analysis, a covariance test (ANCOVA) and independent 
     and dependent T tests were used. RESULTS: After eight weeks of 
     training, there was a significant decrease in the angle of the 
     forward head tilt, kyphosis, round shoulder, and pain questionnaire 
     scores in the training group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the 
     forward head angle, rounded shoulder and kyphosis angle, and pain 
     scores show the desirable effect of resistance training with an 
     elastic band. Therefore, this exercise program is recommended for 
     wheelchair athletes with spinal cord injuries.]

     AB: BACKGROUND: The effect of trunk stability and dynamic balance 
     warm-up exercises on physical functional improvement remains 
     unelucidated. This study examined whether exercises could prevent 
     anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and improve trunk muscle 
     activation and dynamic balance in gymnasts. METHODS: This comparison 
     study, involving gymnastics practice sessions, included 31 university 
     gymnasts and was conducted in two periods: 1 year of observation 
     followed by 2 years of intervention. Participants performed a trunk 
     and dynamic balance warm-up exercise program during the intervention. 
     The effect of exercise on the incidence of ACL injury was evaluated. 
     In addition, the paired t-test was used to compare the Y-balance 
     distance and the changes in muscle thickness associated with trunk 
     muscle activation at rest and during plank. RESULTS: ACL injury risk 
     during the intervention was significantly lower, with a relative risk 
     of 0.23 (P=0.02, 95% CI: 0.06-0.88). Changes in muscle thickness with 
     activation of the transversus abdominis (P<0.01, mean difference 4.1, 
     95% CI: 9.97-28.07, Cohen's d=0.52), internal oblique (P<0.01, mean 
     difference 5.2, 95% CI: 9.72-21.55, Cohen's d=0.65), and external 
     oblique (P<0.01, mean difference 5.5, 95% CI: 20.44-39.09, Cohen's 
     d=0.71) muscles were significantly higher during the intervention. 
     The Y-balance distance was also significantly greater in the 
     posterior medial reach (P<0.01, mean difference 3.3, 95% CI: 
     1.56-6.26, Cohen's d=0.46) during the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: 
     Exercise-based warm-up programs may decrease ACL injuries. It can 
     improve physical functions, such as the rate of change in trunk 
     muscle thickness and the posterior medial distance during Y balance.]

     AB: INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is a worldwide chronic disease. The 
     incidence rate of this disease is high, and it is a common disease in 
     clinics. At present, the incidence rate of diabetes patients is 
     increasing year by year due to the increasing work pressure, the 
     accelerated pace of life, the change of diet, the reduction of labor, 
     and the acceleration of aging. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The computer 
     retrieves four databases to obtain random controlled trials on the 
     influence of resistance exercise and aerobic exercise on type 2 
     diabetes. After a rigorous literature quality evaluation, data 
     analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: 
     Ten studies were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. 10 
     studies reported the HbA1c of the test group and the control group, 
     which was no significant statistical significance (SMD: -0.01; 95% 
     CI: -0.20,0.19; P=0.959) than the control group, HOMA-IR (SMD: 0.02; 
     95% CI: -0.65,0.69; P=0.954), SBP (SMD: 3.92; 95% CI: -0.92,8.75; 
     P=0.112), DBP (SMD: 0.67; 95% CI: -3.66,5.01; P=0.761), HDL (SMD: 
     -0.08; 95% CI: -2.79,2.64; P=0.955), TG (SMD: -7.51; 95% CI: 
     -21.25,6.22; P=0.284) and TC (SMD: 9.10; 95% CI: -13.43,31.62; 
     P=0.428). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that both 
     resistance exercise and aerobic exercise may be effective on patients 
     with type 2 diabetes, as evidenced by HbA1c, HOMA-IR, SBP, DBP, HDL, 
     TG and TC. There is no significant difference in their impact on type 
     2 diabetes patients, and the above conclusions need to be verified by 
     more high-quality studies.]

     AB: INTRODUCTION: Overuse injuries are common in sports involving 
     jumping, running, and landing, due to the repetitive nature of these 
     activities and the strain they place on the lower extremity. The 
     objective of the study was to determine the role of strengthening 
     exercises in the management of overuse sports injuries of lower 
     extremity and its effects on prevention of injury recurrence. 
     EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This study employed a systematic review design. 
     The author extracted and reviewed the papers for this study in 
     accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
     Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria, and then used the PEDro scale to 
     rate the articles' quality. For the most recent and well-developed 
     primary data, several electronic databases including Google Scholar, 
     PubMed Central, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and PEDro were 
     exhaustively searched. Inclusion criteria were based on PICO (T) 
     model and included study population, intervention nature, outcome 
     measures, time period, methodological quality, and linguistic extent. 
     EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The data synthesis involved analyzing randomized 
     control/clinical trials on strengthening exercises for lower 
     extremity overuse sports injuries in athletes, considering outcomes 
     including muscle strength, pain scores, return to sports, and injury 
     prevention. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological quality of the recruited 
     articles ranged from excellent to fair on PEDro scale. Three included 
     studies investigated the effects of strengthening exercises on 
     management of lower extremity injuries of athletes. Four studies 
     evaluated its role on prevention from recurrence of injuries. This 
     study has concluded that strength training plays a fundamental role 
     in management and prevention of overuse injuries. It not only 
     improves the muscle performance, fitness level, speed and agility in 
     sports but also decreases the pain, and aids in early recovery from 
     an injury.]

     Clinical Studies Society. Forces were recorded using proprietary 
     software of a Bertec force platform; force and time data were 
     analyzed with a custom-programmed software tool in Excel. Results: 
     Seven doctors of chiropractic performed 24 thrusts on 23 student 
     recipients. Preload forces, averaging 69.7 N, and thrust loading 
     duration, averaging 167 milliseconds, were similar to previous 
     studies of side-posture manipulation. Peak loads were higher than 
     previous studies, averaging 1010.9 N. Other variables included 
     prethrust liftoff force, times from thrust onset to peak force and 
     peak load to resolution of thrust, and average rates of force loading 
     and unloading. Conclusion: The values we found will be used for 
     reference at our institution and may be useful to instructors at 
     other chiropractic educational institutions, in the teaching of 
     lumbar side-posture manipulation. A caveat is that the values of this 
     study reflect multiple sources of applied force, not solely the force 
     applied directly to the spine.]

     AB: Objective: To investigate if chiropractic placement students in 
     the United Kingdom are aware of current pain evidence and how they 
     relate this to the management of chronic pain patients. Moreover, to 
     gain an understanding of how this can lead to improved pain education 
     planning and engagement in the future. Methods: The revised 
     Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire and the researchers' own 
     questionnaire were administered online to chiropractic placement 
     students. The aggregated total number of correct responses and the 
     individual mean scores were calculated. Statistical analysis included 
     tests of normality and difference using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, 
     Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and Χ2 tests. Results: There was an 
     overall response rate of 21.6% (n = 50). The mean score achieved on 
     the revised neurophysiology of pain questionnaire was 37.8%. A 
     significant difference between individual mean scores on the revised 
     Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire was observed between male and 
     female participants. No differences in mean score were observed 
     between age, number of chronic pain patients seen, and previous 
     qualifications. For the study-specific questionnaire, statistically 
     significant differences were found in mean score for previous 
     qualifications, number of patients seen, and sex. Conclusion: 
     Chiropractic placement students in the United Kingdom appear to have 
     a lower level of pain knowledge than other health care professionals 
     and education institutions may wish to consider how to best address 
     this within their curricula.]

     AB: Objective: From 2009 to 2019, staff, students, and faculty 
     volunteers from a chiropractic college started Mission Trip America, 
     later re-named Service Trip America (STA), providing monthly free 
     chiropractic services at a hiring hall for day laborers in San 
     Francisco until the 2020 COVID-19 hiatus. We report on volunteers' 
     service-learning experiences. Methods: Mixed-methods analysis 
     comprising document review, descriptive report of site visit records, 
     and thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 student 
     and faculty volunteers. Results: STA conducted 104 visits (8-11 per 
     year) including 2272 patient encounters. Document review revealed an 
     average of 22 patients per visit, with 60% to 85% return patients. On 
     average, 3 student interns and 2 student assistants attended each 
     visit, supervised by a doctor of chiropractic faculty member and the 
     program director. Most commonly, interns treated 8 patients during 
     the 4- to 5-hour visits. Patient concerns included musculoskeletal 
     problems and other health conditions commonly seen at chiropractic 
     offices and teaching clinics. Interns also regularly saw chronic 
     health problems exacerbated by poor living conditions, violence, 
     limited access to health care, low educational attainment, chronic 
     stress, and the extreme biomechanical loading resulting from heavy 
     labor. Interview results yielded 4 themes: learning, attitudes, 
     challenges, and program strengths. Interviewees described 
     opportunities to learn while working with a marginalized population 
     and discussed long-term effects on their postgraduation practice as 
     chiropractors. Conclusion: Patients' physical, mental health, and 
     psychosocial issues illustrated unique circumstances and profound 
     needs of the underserved population being cared for by STA 
     volunteers. Our findings may provide guidance for other 
     community-based chiropractic service-learning programs in

     AB: Objective: Chiropractic institutions face the challenging 
     quandary of how to prepare future doctors for entry into a society 
     completely transformed by technology. At an increasing rate, the 
     incoming student profile is representative of a digital generation 
     with a high affinity for technology use. The aim of this study was 
     2-fold: (1) outline the basic elements of a technology integration 
     program at our institution and (2) determine if a potential 
     relationship exists between ongoing training and acceptance of such a 
     programmatic shift among faculty and students. Methods: At each phase 
     of technology integration, electronic survey instruments were 
     deployed to participating students and faculty members. Survey 
     instruments included question items assessed through Likert-type 
     scales and open-ended questions to provide students and faculty 
     members with a vehicle for providing specific feedback. To ensure 
     anonymity of student and faculty survey respondents, the response 
     collection source was a different department than the deployment of 
     the survey emails. Participants were encouraged, but not required, to 
     complete the surveys. Results: Analysis of survey responses generally 
     found increases in overall participant satisfaction and acceptance of 
     the technology integration with the provision of ongoing support 
     systems. Conclusion: As suggested in similar scholarship in the 
     field, the results of this study underscored the value of support 
     systems for faculty members and students in an academic community. 
     The systems that provided ongoing training and other support 
     mechanisms seemed more accepted when tailored to myriad skill levels. 
     Creating a culture in which faculty members and students felt 
     adequately supported fostered the acceptance necessary for forward 
     momentum of a campus initiative of significant change.]

     AB: Objective: To update the state of the art regarding the 
     acquisition of spinal high-velocity low-amplitude psychomotor skills 
     competency among chiropractors and chiropractic students. Methods: 
     Available electronic articles from 5 databases, published between 
     June 2015 and August 2020, were obtained. Eligible studies underwent 
     methodological quality assessments using the Joanna Briggs Institute 
     Critical Appraisal Checklists and Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of 
     Bias Tools. Results: Fourteen critically appraised studies were 
     identified, including 10 cohort studies and 4 randomized controlled 
     trials. There was no literature excluded due to high risk of bias. 
     The type of augmented devices included a mannequin on a force 
     platform, a computer-connected device, a human analogue mannequin, 
     and a 3-dimensional electrogoniometer with an instrumented spatial 
     linkage. Conclusion: The use of augmented feedback devices such as 
     human analogue mannequins with force-sensing table technology and 
     computer-connected devices is potentially beneficial in the 
     chiropractic curricula and may facilitate student learning and 
     improvement of spinal manipulation. More studies are required to 
     determine whether psychomotor skill aids translate directly into 
     raised competency levels in novice clinicians.]

     AB: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of knee 
     joint range of motion (RoM) on the torque-velocity relationship and 
     fatigue in the knee extensor muscles of 7 young (median = 26 y) and 7 
     older (68 y) adults. Each leg was assigned a RoM (35° or 75°) over 
     which to perform a torque-velocity protocol (maximal isokinetic 
     contractions, 60-300°·s−1) and a fatigue protocol (120 maximal 
     contractions at 120°·s−1, 0.5 Hz). Six older participants were 
     unable to reach 300°·s−1 over 35°. Therefore, the velocity 
     eliciting 75% of peak torque at 60°·s−1 (V75, °·s−1) was 
     calculated for each RoM from a fit of individual torque-velocity 
     curves (60-240°·s−1), and ΔV75 (35°-75°) was determined. 
     Fatigue (final torque/initial torque) was used to calculate Δfatigue 
     (35°-75°). ΔV75 was not different from 0 in young 
     (−28.3°·s−1 [−158.6 to 55.7], median [range], P = .091) or 
     older (−18.5°·s−1 [−95.0 to 23.9], P = .128), with no 
     difference by age (P = .710). In contrast, fatigue was greater for 
     75° in young (Δfatigue = 25.9% [17.5-30.3], P = .018) and older 
     (17.2% [11.9-52.9], P = .018), with no effect of age (P = .710). 
     These data indicate that, regardless of age, RoM did not alter the 
     torque-velocity relationship between 60 and 240°·s−1, and fatigue 
     was greater with a larger RoM.]

     AB: Imbalanced joint load distribution across the tibiofemoral 
     surface is a risk factor for osteoarthritic changes to this joint. 
     Lateral wedge insoles, with and without arch support, are a form of 
     biomechanical intervention that can redistribute tibiofemoral joint 
     load, as estimated by external measures of knee load. The objective 
     of this study was to examine the effect of these insoles on the 
     internal joint contact characteristics of osteoarthritic knees during 
     weightbearing. Fifteen adults with tibiofemoral osteoarthritis 
     underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the affected knee, while 
     standing under 3 insole conditions: flat control, lateral wedge 
     alone, and lateral wedge with arch support. Images were processed, 
     and the surface area and centroid location of joint contact were 
     quantified separately for the medial and lateral tibiofemoral 
     compartments. Medial contact surface area was increased with the 2 
     lateral wedge conditions compared with the control (P ≤ .012). A 
     more anterior contact centroid was observed in the medial compartment 
     in the lateral wedge with arch support compared with the lateral 
     wedge alone (P = .009). Significant changes in lateral compartment 
     joint contact outcomes were not observed. These findings represent 
     early insights into how loading at the tibiofemoral interface may be 
     altered by lateral wedge insoles as a potential intervention for knee 
     osteoarthritis.]

     AB: Assessment of player's postural control following a lower limb 
     injury is of interest to sports medicine practitioners due to its 
     fundamental role in daily tasks and sporting activities. The aim was 
     to longitudinally monitor professional rugby union players' postural 
     control during each phase of the rehabilitation program (acute, 
     middle, and late) following a lower limb injury. Seven male rugby 
     union players (height 1.80 [0.02] m; mass 100.3 [11.4] kg; age 24 [4] 
     y) sustained a time loss, noncontact lower limb injury. Static 
     postural control was assessed via sway path (in meters), and dynamic 
     postural control was assessed via vertical postural stability index. 
     Group differences (P < .05) were reported across the acute, middle, 
     and late phase. Smaller magnitudes of sway path were observed for 
     eyes-open sway path, and for the middle and late phase smaller 
     magnitudes of vertical postural stability index (P < .05) at the end 
     session compared with first session. Whereas larger magnitudes of 
     vertical postural stability index were found between baseline and the 
     last session (P < .05). Large interindividual and intraindividual 
     variation was apparent across the 3 phases of rehabilitation. 
     Postural control improvements were identified during rehabilitation. 
     However, postural control did not return to baseline, with altered 
     kinetics throughout each rehabilitation phase.]

     AB: Following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), 
     patients exhibit abnormal walking mechanics and quadriceps 
     dysfunction. Quadriceps dysfunction has been largely attributed to 
     muscle atrophy and weakness. While important, these factors do not 
     capture intrinsic properties of muscle that govern its ability to 
     generate force and withstand load. While fascicle abnormalities after 
     ACLR have been documented in early stages of recovery (<12 mo), 
     long-term effects of ACLR on fascicle mechanics remain unexplored. We 
     evaluated quadriceps fascicle mechanics during walking 3 years 
     post-ACLR and examined the relationship with knee mechanics. 
     Participants included 24 individuals with ACLR and 24 Controls. 
     Linear mixed models compared the ACLR, Contralateral, and Controls 
     limbs for (1) quadriceps strength, (2) fascicle architecture and 
     mechanics, and (3) knee mechanics. No difference in strength or 
     overall fascicle length excursions was found between limbs. The ACLR 
     limb exhibited longer fascicles at heel strike and peak knee 
     extension moment (P < .001-.004), and smaller fascicle angles at heel 
     strike, peak knee extension moment, and overall suppressed fascicle 
     angle excursions (P < .001-.049) relative to the Contralateral and/or 
     Control limb. This indicates an abnormality in fascicle architecture 
     and mechanics following ACLR and suggests abnormalities in 
     contractile function that cannot be explained by muscle weakness and 
     may contribute to long-term gait irregularities.]

     AB: Recommendations on the use of acupuncture in managing low back 
     pain (LBP) vary across different guidelines. The methodological 
     quality of existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses on this 
     topic also demonstrates considerable diversity, potentially leading 
     to biased conclusions. Therefore, we comprehensively searched PubMed, 
     EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and 
     Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases and 
     conducted an umbrella review. Scrutiny was performed to ascertain 
     whether primary studies within the systematic reviews and 
     meta-analyses adhered to our inclusion criteria, followed by a 
     meticulous reanalysis of pertinent data. Participant numbers, 
     heterogeneity, publication bias, and excessive significance were 
     taken into account when assessing the credibility of the evidence. 
     For robustness, sensitivity analysis was performed using the 
     leave-one-out method. The results of the umbrella review yielded 
     highly suggestive evidence in favor of the immediate and short-term 
     analgesic effects of acupuncture, with suggestive evidence supporting 
     intermediate-term analgesic effects. However, the effectiveness of 
     acupuncture on disability improvement has demonstrated weak to 
     suggestive evidence. Evidence supporting the enhancement of quality 
     of life by acupuncture is limited. The leave-one-out analysis 
     corroborated the robustness of the meta-analysis, further confirming 
     the credibility of the findings. This umbrella review indicated that 
     the most significant advantage of acupuncture for LBP is its capacity 
     to reduce pain.]

     AB: Atherosclerosis is a significant risk factor for developing 
     cardiovascular disease and a leading cause of death worldwide. The 
     occurrence of atherosclerosis is closely related to factors such as 
     endothelial injury, lipid deposition, immunity, and inflammation. 
     Conventional statins, currently used in atherosclerosis treatment, 
     have numerous adverse side effects that limit their clinical utility, 
     prompting the urgent need to identify safer and more effective 
     therapeutic alternatives. Growing evidence indicates the significant 
     potential of Chinese herbs in atherosclerosis treatment. Herbal 
     monomer components, such as natural flavonoid compounds extracted 
     from herbs like Coptis chinensis and Panax notoginseng, have been 
     utilized for their lipid-lowering and inflammation-inhibiting effects 
     in atherosclerosis treatment. These herbs can be used as single 
     components in treating diseases and with other Chinese medicines to 
     form herbal combinations. This approach targets the disease mechanism 
     in multiple ways, enhancing the therapeutic effects. Thus, this 
     review examines the roles of Chinese herbal medicine monomers and 
     Chinese herbal compounds in inhibiting atherosclerosis, including 
     regulating lipids, improving endothelial function, reducing oxidative 
     stress, regulating inflammation and the immune response, and 
     apoptosis. By highlighting these roles, our study offers new 
     perspectives on atherosclerosis treatment with Chinese herbs and is 
     anticipated to contribute to advancements in related research 
     fields.]

     AB: Osteoporosis (OP) represents a substantial public health issue 
     and is associated with increasing rates of morbidity and mortality. 
     It is characterized by reduced bone mineral density, deterioration of 
     bone tissue quality, disruption of the microarchitecture of bones, 
     and compromised bone strength. These changes may be attributed to the 
     following factors: intercellular communication between osteoblasts 
     and osteoclasts; imbalanced bone remodeling; imbalances between 
     osteogenesis and adipogenesis; imbalances in hormonal regulation; 
     angiogenesis; chronic inflammation; oxidative stress; and intestinal 
     microbiota imbalances. Treating a single aspect of the disease is 
     insufficient to address its multifaceted nature. In recent decades, 
     traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown great potential in the 
     treatment of OP, and the therapeutic effects of Chinese patent drugs 
     and Chinese medicinal herbs have been scientifically proven. TCMs, 
     which contain multiple components, can target the diverse 
     pathogeneses of OP through a multitargeted approach. Herbs such as 
     XLGB, JTG, GSB, Yinyanghuo, Gusuibu, Buguzhi, and Nvzhenzi are among 
     the TCMs that can be used to treat OP and have demonstrated promising 
     effects in this context. They exert their therapeutic effects by 
     targeting various pathways involved in bone metabolism. These TCMs 
     balance the activity of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) and 
     osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells), and they exhibit 
     anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-oxidative, and 
     estrogen-like functions. These multifaceted mechanisms underlie the 
     efficacy of these herbs in the management and treatment of OP. 
     Herein, we examine the efficacy of various Chinese herbs and Chinese 
     patent drugs in treating OP by reviewing previous clinical trials and 
     basic experiments, and we examine the potential mechanism of these 
     therapies to provide evidence regarding the use of TCM for treating 
     OP.]

     AB: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of 
     breast cancer. Conventional treatment options for TNBC often have 
     limited efficacy and significant side effects. In recent years, 
     traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown promising results in the 
     treatment of TNBC. TCMs include herb combinations that have 
     synergistic effects to regulate homeostasis in the body, reduce tumor 
     resistance, and improve patient quality of life. At present, three 
     main TCM methods are used to treat TNBC in the clinic: strengthening 
     the body's resistance, dispelling phlegm, and removing cancer toxins. 
     This paper reviews the theories and mechanisms of each in TNBC 
     treatment. The method of strengthening the body's resistance 
     emphasizes enhancing the body's original Qi to fight against 
     pathogenic factors; the method of dispelling phlegm seeks to 
     eliminate phlegm stagnation and alleviate the burden on affected 
     organs; the method of removing cancer toxins focuses on 
     detoxification and detumescence to remove the toxic elements 
     associated with TNBC. Although these methods treat TNBC from 
     different etiologies, they have achieved good therapeutic effects and 
     represent an important academic approach: That is, to cure the 
     disease with a comprehensive view of the body and restore the balance 
     of Yin and Yang. This knowledge lays a foundation for the future 
     development and reasonable application of TCM in the clinic.]

     AB: Globally, cervical cancer poses a substantial public health 
     challenge, with low and middle-income countries bearing the highest 
     burden [Rajkhowa, P. D.S. Patil, S.M. Dsouza, P. Narayanan and H. 
     Brand. Evidence on factors influencing HPV vaccine implementation in 
     South Asia: a scoping review. Glob. Public Health 18: 2288269, 2023]. 
     The incidence rate ranks second highest among female malignant tumors 
     in China, following only breast cancer. The prognosis of advanced 
     cervical cancer is extremely poor, with a 5-year progression-free 
     survival (PFS) rate of only 15%, and the treatment of advanced 
     recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer remains a huge challenge. An 
     increasing amount of evidence suggests that traditional Chinese 
     medicine (TCM) can significantly enhance sensitivity to 
     chemotherapeutic drugs, strengthen antitumor effects, and notably 
     improve adverse reactions associated with cancer such as fatigue and 
     bone marrow suppression. In recent years, the therapeutic effects and 
     mechanisms of Chinese herbal medicines, such as the 
     Guizhi-Fuling-decoction, the compound Yangshe granule, Huangqi, and 
     Ginseng, herbal monomers (e.g. Ginsenoside Rh2, Tanshinone IIA, and 
     Tetrandrine), and the related extracts and compound formulations, 
     have received extensive attention for the treatment of cervical 
     cancer. This paper reviews the research progress of TCM in cervical 
     cancer. In addition, we reported a case of an advanced cervical 
     cancer patient with multiple abdominal and pelvic metastasis who 
     initially received chemotherapy, was then treated with TCM alone, and 
     subsequently survived for 22 years. The model of whole-process 
     management with TCM can enable more cancer patients to obtain longer 
     survival periods.]

     AB: The use of medicinal leeches in clinical therapy has been 
     employed for a long time, as it was originally recognized for 
     exerting antithrombin effects. These effects were due to the ability 
     of the leech to continuously suck blood while attached to human skin. 
     According to Chinese Pharmacopoei, leeches used in traditional 
     Chinese medicine mainly consist of Whitmania pigra Whitman, Hirudo 
     nipponia Whitman, and Whitmania acranulata, but the latter two 
     species are relatively scarce. The main constituents of leeches are 
     protein and peptide macromolecules. They can be categorized into two 
     categories based on their pharmacological effects. One group consists 
     of active ingredients that directly target the coagulation system, 
     such as hirudin, heparin, and histamine, which are widely known. The 
     other group comprises protease inhibitor components like Decorsin and 
     Hementin. Among these, hirudin secreted by the salivary glands of the 
     leech is the most potent thrombin inhibitor and served as the sole 
     remedy for preventing blood clotting until the discovery of heparin. 
     Additionally, leeches play a significant role in various traditional 
     Chinese medicine formulations. In recent decades, medicinal leeches 
     have been applied in fields including anti-inflammatory treatment, 
     cardiovascular disease management, antitumor treatment, and many 
     other medical conditions. In this review, we present a comprehensive 
     overview of the historical journey and medicinal applications of 
     leeches in various medical conditions, emphasizing their 
     pharmaceutical significance within traditional Chinese medicine. This 
     review offers valuable insights for exploring additional therapeutic 
     opportunities involving the use of leeches in various diseases and 
     elucidating their underlying mechanisms for future research.]

     AB: Neurological disorders (NDs) are diseases that seriously affect 
     the health of individuals worldwide, potentially leading to a 
     significant reduction in the quality of life for patients and their 
     families. Herbal medicines have been widely used in the treatment of 
     NDs due to their multi-target and multi-pathway features. Ginkgo 
     biloba leaves (GBLs), one of the most popular herbal medicines in the 
     world, have been demonstrated to present therapeutic effects on NDs. 
     However, the pharmacological mechanisms of GBLs in the treatment of 
     neurological disorders have not been systematically summarized. This 
     study aimed to summarize the molecular mechanism of GBLs in treating 
     NDs from the cell models, animal models, and clinical trials of 
     studies. Four databases, i.e. PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, and Web 
     of Science were searched using the following keywords: "Ginkgo 
     biloba", "Ginkgo biloba extract", "Ginkgo biloba leaves", "Ginkgo 
     biloba leaves extract", "Neurological disorders", "Neurological 
     diseases", and "Neurodegenerative diseases". All items meeting the 
     inclusion criteria on the treatment of NDs with GBLs were extracted 
     and summarized. Additionally, PRISMA 2020 was performed to 
     independently evaluate the screening methods. Out of 1385 records in 
     the database, 52 were screened in relation to the function of GBLs in 
     the treatment of NDs; of these 52 records, 39 were preclinical trials 
     and 13 were clinical studies. Analysis of pharmacological studies 
     revealed that GBLs can improve memory, cognition, behavior, and 
     psychopathology of NDs and that the most frequently associated GBLs 
     are depression, followed by Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Huntington's 
     disease, and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the clinical studies 
     of depression, AD, and stroke are the most common, and most of the 
     remaining ND data are available from in vitro or in vivo animal 
     studies. Moreover, the possible mechanisms of GBLs in treating NDs 
     are mainly through free radical scavenging, anti-oxidant activity, 
     anti-inflammatory response, mitochondrial protection, 
     neurotransmitter regulation, and antagonism of PAF. This is the first 
     paper to systematically and comprehensively investigate the 
     pharmacological effects and neuroprotective mechanisms of GBLs in the 
     treatment of NDs thus far. All findings contribute to a better 
     understanding of the efficacy and complexity of GBLs in treating NDs, 
     which is of great significance for the further clinical application 
     of this herbal medicine.]

     AB: Flavonol and flavonoid compounds are important natural compounds 
     with various biomedical activities. Therefore, it is of great 
     significance to develop a strategy for the specific extraction of 
     flavonol and flavonoid compounds. Quercetin is a well-studied 
     flavonoid possessing many health benefits. This compound is a 
     versatile antioxidant known to possess protective abilities against 
     body tissue injury induced by pathological situations and various 
     drug toxicities. Although quercetin is widely distributed in many 
     plants, its content generally is not very high. Therefore, the 
     specific extraction of quercetin as well as other flavonol and 
     flavonoid compounds has profound significance. In this work, the 
     quercetin molecularly imprinting polymer (QMIP) was successfully 
     prepared, in which a typical flavonol quercetin was selected as the 
     template molecule. QMIP was synthesized by performing the surface 
     molecular imprinting technology on the surface of NH2-MIL-101(Fe). 
     Our study results showed that QMIP exhibited quick binding kinetic 
     behavior, a high adsorption capacity (57.04mg/g), and the specific 
     recognition ability toward quercetin compared with structurally 
     distinct compounds (selective factor>2). The specific adsorption 
     ability of quercetin by QMIP was further explained using computation 
     simulation that molecules with non-planar 3D conformations hardly 
     entered the molecularly imprinted cavities on QMIP. Finally, QMIP was 
     successfully used for the specific extraction of quercetin and five 
     other flavonol and flavonoid compounds in the crude extracts from 
     Sapium sebiferum. This study proposes a new strategy to synthesize 
     the molecularly imprinted polymer based on a single template for 
     enriching and loading a certain class of active ingredients with 
     similar core structures from variable botanicals.]

     agents to improve the current repertoire of therapeutic drugs. 
     Wogonin, a flavonoid from the herbal medicine Scutellaria 
     baicalensis, has unique antitumor activity. Our study aimed to 
     further explore the inhibitory effects of wogonin on colorectal 
     cancer and its specific mechanism. The results showed that wogonin 
     significantly inhibited the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells 
     as well as their ability to invade and metastasize. We detected 
     phosphorylation of tumor-associated signaling pathways using a 
     phosphorylated protein microarray and found that wogonin intervention 
     significantly inhibited the phosphorylation level of the AKT protein 
     in colorectal cancer cells. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, 
     it was confirmed that wogonin exerted its antitumor effects against 
     colorectal cancer by inhibiting phosphorylation in the AKT pathway.

     AB: Heat shock proteins (HSPs), which function as chaperones, are 
     activated in response to various environmental stressors. In addition 
     to their role in diverse aspects of protein production, HSPs protect 
     against harmful protein-related stressors. Calycosin exhibits 
     numerous beneficial properties. This study aims to explore the 
     protective effects of calycosin in the heart under heat shock and 
     determine its underlying mechanism. H9c2 cells, western blot, TUNEL 
     staining, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining were used. 
     The time-dependent effects of heat shock analyzed using western blot 
     revealed increased HSP expression for up to 2h, followed by protein 
     degradation after 4h. Hence, a heat shock damage duration of 4h was 
     chosen for subsequent investigations. Calycosin administered 
     post-heat shock demonstrated dose-dependent recovery of cell 
     viability. Under heat shock conditions, calycosin prevented the 
     apoptosis of H9c2 cells by upregulating HSPs, suppressing p-JNK, 
     enhancing Bcl-2 activation, and inhibiting cleaved caspase 3. 
     Calycosin also inhibited Fas/FasL expression and activated cell 
     survival markers (p-PI3K, p-ERK, p-Akt), indicating their 
     cytoprotective properties through PI3K/Akt activation and JNK 
     inhibition. TUNEL staining and flow cytometry confirmed that 
     calycosin reduced apoptosis. Moreover, calycosin reversed the 
     inhibitory effects of quercetin on HSF1 and Hsp70 expression, 
     illustrating its role in enhancing Hsp70 expression through HSF1 
     activation during heat shock. Immunofluorescence staining 
     demonstrated HSF1 translocation to the nucleus following calycosin 
     treatment, emphasizing its cytoprotective effects. In conclusion, 
     calycosin exhibits pronounced protective effects against heat 
     shock-induced damages by modulating HSP expression and regulating key 
     signaling pathways to promote cell survival in H9c2 cells.]

     AB: Hyperglycemia induces chronic stresses, such as oxidative stress 
     and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which can result in β-cell 
     dysfunction and development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). 
     Ginsenoside Rk1 is a minor ginsenoside isolated from Ginseng. It has 
     been shown to exert anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and 
     neuroprotective effects; however, its effects on pancreatic cells in 
     T2DM have never been studied. This study aims to examine the novel 
     effects of Ginsenoside Rk1 on ER stress-induced apoptosis in a 
     pancreatic β-cell line MIN6 and HFD-induced diabetic pancreas, and 
     their underlying mechanisms. We demonstrated that Ginsenoside Rk1 
     alleviated ER stress-induced apoptosis in MIN6 cells, which was 
     accomplished by directly targeting and activating insulin-like growth 
     factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), thus activating the phosphoinositide 
     3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/Bcl-2-associated agonist of 
     cell death (Bad)-B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) pathway. This pathway was 
     also confirmed in an HFD-induced diabetic pancreas. Meanwhile, the 
     use of the IGF-1R inhibitor PQ401 abolished this anti-apoptotic 
     effect, confirming the role of IGF-1R in mediating anti-apoptosis 
     effects exerted by Ginsenoside Rk1. Besides, Ginsenoside Rk1 reduced 
     pancreas weights and increased pancreatic insulin contents, 
     suggesting that it could protect the pancreas from HFD-induced 
     diabetes. Taken together, our study provided novel protective effects 
     of Ginsenoside Rk1 on ER stress-induced β-cell apoptosis and 
     HFD-induced diabetic pancreases, as well as its direct target with 
     IGF-1R, indicating that Ginsenoside Rk1 could be a potential drug for 
     the treatment of T2DM.]

     AB: Background: Gait characteristics and their changes during the 
     6-minute walking test (6MWT) in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) 
     have been described in the literature, which one may refer to as 
     walking fatigability in the body function level of the International 
     Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. However, 
     whether these metrics are reliable is unknown. Objective: To 
     investigate the between-day reliability of the gait characteristics 
     and their changes in pwMS and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: 
     Forty-nine pwMS (EDSS 4.82 ± 1.22 and 54.7 ± 9.36 years) and 23 HCs 
     (50.6 ± 6.1 years) performed the 6MWT, as fast as possible but 
     safely while wearing Inertial Measurement Units. Gait characteristics 
     were measured in the pace, rhythm, variability, asymmetry, 
     kinematics, coordination, and postural control domains and were 
     obtained in intervals of 1 minute during the 6MWT. In addition, gait 
     characteristics change in the last minute compared with the first 
     minute were calculated for all gait variables using a fatigability 
     index (ie, distance walking index). The intraclass correlation 
     coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman Plots, and Standard error of 
     measurement were applied to investigate reliability. Results: 
     Reliability of gait characteristics, minute-by-minute, and for their 
     changes (ie, using the fatigability index) ranged from poor to 
     excellent (pwMS: ICC 0.46-0.96; HC: ICC 0.09-0.97 and pwMS: ICC 
     0-0.72; HC: ICC 0-0.77, respectively). Conclusion: Besides 
     coordination, at least 1 variable of each gait domain showed an ICC 
     of moderate or good reliability for gait characteristics changes in 
     both pwMS and HC. These metrics can be incorporated into future 
     clinical trials and research on walking fatigability.]

     AB: Background: The aim of the International Stroke Recovery and 
     Rehabilitation Alliance is to create a world where worldwide 
     collaboration brings major breakthroughs for the millions of people 
     living with stroke. A key pillar of this work is to define globally 
     relevant criteria for centers that aspire to deliver excellent 
     clinical rehabilitation and generate exceptional outcomes for 
     patients. Objectives: This paper presents consensus work conducted 
     with an international group of expert stroke recovery and 
     rehabilitation researchers, clinicians, and people living with stroke 
     to identify and define criteria and measurable indicators for Centers 
     of Clinical Excellence (CoCE) in stroke recovery and rehabilitation. 
     These were intentionally developed to be ambitious and 
     internationally relevant, regardless of a country's development or 
     income status, to drive global improvement in stroke services. 
     Methods: Criteria and specific measurable indicators for CoCE were 
     collaboratively developed by an international panel of stroke 
     recovery and rehabilitation experts from 10 countries and consumer 
     groups from 5 countries. Results: The criteria and associated 
     indicators, ranked in order of importance, focused upon (i) optimal 
     outcome, (ii) research culture, (iii) working collaboratively with 
     people living with stroke, (iv) knowledge exchange, (v) leadership, 
     (vi) education, and (vii) advocacy. Work is currently underway to 
     user-test the criteria and indicators in 14 rehabilitation centers in 
     10 different countries. Conclusions: We anticipate that use of the 
     criteria and indicators could support individual organizations to 
     further develop their services and, more widely, provide a mechanism 
     by which clinical excellence can be articulated and shared to 
     generate global improvements in stroke care.]

     AB: Background: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a frequent 
     psychiatric complication, however very few studies have investigated 
     its relation to the affected upper extremity (UE) post-stroke. 
     Objective. To compare the affected UE in terms of motor impairment, 
     functional ability, and daily-use in individuals with and without PSD 
     during the first 6 months post-stroke. Methods: This study analyzed 
     data from a previous cohort; participants were assessed at 
     rehabilitation admission (T1), 6 weeks (T2), and 6 months (T3) 
     post-stroke. At each time point we compared between participants with 
     and without PSD (Geriatric Depression Scale score ≥ 5). The 
     Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment assessed motor impairment, Action 
     Research Arm Test assessed functional ability, and the Rating of 
     Everyday Arm-Use in the Community and Home assessed daily-use. 
     Independence in daily activities and cognition were also assessed. 
     Results: A total of 116 participants were recruited, 38% had PSD at 
     T1. No significant differences were found between groups at T1 and 
     T2. However, significant differences (z = −5.23 to −2.66, p < 
     .01) were found between groups for all UE measures at T3; 
     participants with PSD had lower motor and functional ability and less 
     daily hand-use than participants without PSD. At T3 participants with 
     PSD were also less independent in daily-living. Conclusions: PSD is 
     associated with greater UE motor, functional, and daily-use 
     disability at 6 months post-stroke. Our findings underscore the 
     negative impact of PSD on UE during the crucial transition period 
     when individuals return home and integrate back into the community. 
     Further research is needed to delineate the effect of change in PSD 
     status on UE outcomes post stroke.]

     AB: Background: Cerebellum shares robust di-synaptic 
     dentato-thalamo-cortical (DTC) connections with the contralateral 
     motor cortex. Preclinical studies have shown that DTC are excitatory 
     in nature. Structural integrity of DTC is associated with better 
     upper extremity (UE) motor function in people with stroke, indicating 
     DTC are important for cerebellar influences on movement. However, 
     there is a lack of understanding of physiologic influence of DTC in 
     humans, largely due to difficulty in accessing the dentate nucleus. 
     Objective: Characterize DTC physiology using dentate nucleus deep 
     brain stimulation (DBS) combined with transcranial magnetic 
     stimulation (TMS) in stroke. Methods: Nine chronic stroke survivors 
     with moderate-to-severe UE impairment (Fugl-Meyer 13-38) underwent a 
     paired DBS-TMS experiment before receiving experimental dentate 
     nucleus DBS in our first-in-human phase I trial (Baker et al. 2023, 
     Nature Medicine). Conditioning DBS pulses were given to dentate 
     nucleus 1 to 10 ms prior to supra-threshold TMS pulses given to 
     ipsilesional motor cortex. Effects were assessed on motor evoked 
     potentials (MEPs). Size of DBS-conditioned MEPs was expressed 
     relative to TMS MEPs, where values >1 indicate facilitation. Results: 
     Dentate nucleus DBS led to facilitation of MEPs at short-latency 
     intervals (3.5 and 5 ms, P = .049 and .021, respectively), a 
     phenomenon we have termed dentato-cortical facilitation (DCF). Higher 
     DCF was observed among patients with more severe UE impairment. 
     Diffusion tensor imaging revealed microstructure of thalamo-cortical 
     portion of DTC was related to higher corticomotor excitability. 
     Conclusions: Our in vivo investigation reveals for the first time in 
     humans the intrinsic excitatory properties of DTC, which can serve as 
     a novel therapeutic target for post-stroke motor recovery.]

     AB: Background: Parkinson's disease can negatively affect vocal 
     functioning and social wellbeing, particularly in the latter stages 
     of disease progression. Face-to-face group singing interventions can 
     improve communication and wellbeing outcomes, yet not all people can 
     access in-person sessions. To help overcome barriers to 
     participation, exploration of the feasibility and utility of online 
     therapeutic singing programs is needed. Objectives: To evaluate the 
     feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week 
     ParkinSong Online intervention on speech and wellbeing for people 
     with Parkinson's disease. Methods: A total of 28 participants with 
     idiopathic Parkinson's disease were recruited to a single-arm 
     feasibility study. Weekly 90-minute online sessions were 
     co-facilitated by a music therapist and speech pathologist. Speech 
     and wellbeing assessments were conducted pre and post intervention. 
     Participant and facilitator surveys were administered after each 
     session, with focus group interviews at the end of the program. 
     Results: The recruitment rate was high (90%) with no attrition, 
     adverse events, or safety issues. There was good intervention 
     fidelity, attendance (average 89%), and positive participant 
     experience. Feasibility was good, with technology reported as the 
     main challenge (connecting and navigating Zoom). No improvements were 
     seen in voice measures or wellbeing outcomes in this small trial. The 
     online format used in this study did not provide the same benefits as 
     in-person ParkinSong sessions. Conclusions: ParkinSong Online is 
     feasible for recreational purposes and social engagement provided 
     that people have adequate technological knowledge or support. The 
     optimal online delivery format to achieve communication improvements 
     in Parkinson's awaits confirmation.]

     MD: AB]
     AB: Background: Little is known about how peripheral nerve injury 
     affects human performance, behavior, and life. Hand use choices are 
     important for rehabilitation after unilateral impairment, but rarely 
     measured, and are not changed by the normal course of rehabilitation 
     and daily life. Objective: To identify the relationship between hand 
     use (L/R choices), motor performance, and patient-centered outcomes. 
     Methods: Participants (n = 48) with unilateral peripheral nerve 
     injury were assessed for hand use via Block Building Task, Motor 
     Activity Log, and Edinburgh Handedness Inventory; dexterity 
     (separately for each hand) via Nine-Hole Peg Test, Jebsen Taylor Hand 
     Function Test, and a precision drawing task; patient-centered 
     outcomes via surveys of disability, activity participation, and 
     health-related quality of life; and injury-related factors including 
     injury cause and affected nerve. Factor Analysis of Mixed Data was 
     used to explore relationships between these variables. The data were 
     analyzed under 2 approaches: comparing dominant hand (DH) versus 
     non-dominant hand (NH), or affected versus unaffected hand. Results: 
     The data were best explained by 5 dimensions. Good patient outcomes 
     were associated with NH performance, DH performance (separately and 
     secondarily to NH performance), and preserved function and use of the 
     affected hand; whereas poor patient outcomes were associated with 
     preserved but unused function of the affected hand. Conclusion: After 
     unilateral peripheral nerve injury, hand function, hand usage, and 
     patient life arise from a complex interaction of many factors. To 
     optimize rehabilitation after unilateral impairment, new 
     rehabilitation methods are needed to promote performance and use with 
     the NH, as well as the injured hand.]

     AB: Introduction: The prevalence of upper limb motor weakness early 
     post-stroke may be changing, which can have clinical and research 
     implications. Our primary aim was to describe the prevalence of upper 
     limb motor weakness early post-stroke, with a secondary aim to 
     contextualize this prevalence by describing pre-stroke outcomes, 
     other post-stroke impairments, functional activities, and discharge 
     destination. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study 
     extracted clinical data from confirmed stroke patients admitted to a 
     metropolitan stroke unit over 15-months. The primary upper limb 
     weakness measure was Shoulder Abduction and Finger Extension (SAFE) 
     score. Demographics (eg, age), clinical characteristics (eg, stroke 
     severity), pre-stroke outcomes (eg, clinical frailty), other 
     post-stroke impairments (eg, command following), functional 
     activities (eg, ambulation), and discharge destination were also 
     extracted. Results: A total of 463 participants had a confirmed 
     stroke and SAFE score. One-third of patients received ≥1 acute 
     medical intervention(s). Nearly one-quarter of patients were 
     classified as frail pre-stroke. Upper limb weakness (SAFE≤8) was 
     present in 35% [95% CI: 30%-39%] at a median of 1-day post-stroke, 
     with 22% presenting with mild-moderate weakness (SAFE5-8). The most 
     common other impairments were upper limb coordination (46%), delayed 
     recall (41%), and upper limb sensation (26%). After a median 3-day 
     acute stroke stay, 52% of the sample were discharged home. 
     Conclusion: Upper limb weakness was present in just over a third 
     (35%) of the sample early post-stroke. Data on pre-stroke outcomes 
     and the prevalence of other post-stroke impairments highlights the 
     complexity and heterogeneity of stroke recovery. Further research is 
     required to tease out meaningful recovery phenotypes and their 
     implications.]

     AB: Background: One in three athletes who suffer a sprain will end up 
     with chronic ankle instability (CAI) due to re-injury or inadequate 
     recovery, with symptoms that can last for more than 12 months. 
     Resistance and proprioceptive training have been shown to have a 
     positive effect on the rehabilitation of CAI, improving perceived 
     instability, balance, functional ability, strength, and quality of 
     life. However, the right type of training, dosage, and intensity are 
     currently unclear on many points. Aim: The aim of this review is to 
     investigate current literature addressing the effects of resistance 
     and proprioceptive training on improving the symptoms of athletes 
     with CAI. The individual efficacy of each training type (resistance 
     and proprioceptive) was investigated and compared to each other. 
     Furthermore, it was examined whether the combined application of both 
     training methods within a single treatment regimen provides greater 
     benefits than their separate use. Method: The MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, 
     PEDro, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and EMBASE databases were searched using 
     different combinations of the following key words: chronic ankle 
     instability, athletes, proprioceptive exercise, resistance exercise, 
     and rehabilitation. The review included clinical studies that were 
     applied to professional or amateur athletes with CAI from 1998 to the 
     present. These studies included protocols for resistance and/or 
     proprioceptive exercise programs that were applied independently or 
     in combination with other therapy regimens. Results: Eighteen 
     clinical trials were included in this review: three on resistance 
     training, five on proprioceptive training, and ten on both. The 
     Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) was used to assess the 
     quality of all articles. Discussion: Both types of training, 
     resistance and proprioceptive, improve perceived instability, static 
     and dynamic balance, functional ability, strength and, quality of 
     life in the athletic population with CAI. However, better results 
     appear to be derived from combined protocols that include both types 
     of exercises. Conclusions: Four to six weeks of a combined resistance 
     and proprioceptive exercise program may increase the strength of the 
     ankle joint muscles, dynamic balance, functional ability and quality 
     of life in athletes with CAI.]

     AB: A placebo is the result of an individual's neurobiological and 
     psychophysiological responses to a substance or therapy that has no 
     therapeutic effect but produces an improvement. Previously, some 
     commonly prescribed therapies for chronic low back pain have been 
     shown to be no better than placebo or only marginally more effective. 
     The aim of this systematic literature review was therefore to examine 
     the effects of placebo on the management of chronic low back pain. A 
     review of the literature available in the PubMed, CINAHL and PEDro 
     databases from 2012 to 2023 provided a set of nine studies. The 
     results of the included studies suggest that placebo is part of any 
     therapy in the form of various interacting biopsychosocial factors. 
     Placebo has been shown to have the greatest effect on the emotional 
     aspect of the pain experience, with less effect on the functional 
     capacity of the patient. The authors of the included studies 
     confirmed that expectation is the most important factor in placebo 
     analgesia, which is also influenced by the physiotherapist through 
     (in)adequate communication. In addition to the individual's 
     expectations, his/her experience and mindset toward the therapy may 
     also determine to what extent the placebo will work. All of these 
     factors vary from individual to individual. Therefore, it is not 
     possible to give a unique answer about placebo effects and factors, 
     and further research in this area is needed in the future.]

     AB: Background: Blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy has emerged as a 
     promising rehabilitation approach after knee surgery. The technique 
     involves the use of a tourniquet or cuff to limit blood flow to the 
     affected limb during low-resistance exercise, which creates a hypoxic 
     environment thought to stimulate muscle growth and improve muscle 
     function. Objective: Our scoping review aims to examine the current 
     literature on the effectiveness of BFR combined with low-resistance 
     exercise on rehabilitation after knee surgery. Method: The Google 
     Scholar, PubMed, and PEDro databases were searched using relevant 
     key-words. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for 
     analysis. The data from the selected studies were analyzed, 
     categorized, and summarized to provide an overview of the findings. 
     Results: In total, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and were 
     included in the review. Outcomes such as pain, strength, and range of 
     motion were assessed. Conclusion: The results suggest that BFR and 
     low-resistance exercise can be effective in improving patient 
     outcomes following knee surgery. However, the heterogeneity of the 
     studies made it difficult to determine the most effective approach. 
     Further research is needed to identify the optimal dosage, frequency, 
     and duration of BFR and low-resistance exercise for knee surgery

     AB: Background: Because of the multitude of variables that affect the 
     retirement decisions of professional soccer players, it has proven 
     difficult to isolate the effect of undergoing anterior cruciate 
     ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) on career longevity. Purpose: To 
     compare the career longevity of professional soccer players after a 
     primary ACLR with that of an uninjured matched control cohort. Study. 
     Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective 
     review of a consecutive series of primary ACLR was performed between 
     2008 and 2018 in professional male soccer players from the senior 
     author's practice. Each athlete with ACLR was matched to 3 control 
     athletes who had not undergone ACLR according to age, league, playing 
     position, and preinjury game appearances/minutes played. Player 
     career statistics-including league, game appearances, and game 
     minutes-were compiled for each year until retirement or July 1, 2022. 
     Results: A total of 82 soccer players in the English Premier League 
     or Championship at the time of their primary ACLR were matched to 246 
     control athletes. The mean career length after ACLR was 6 ± 2.6 
     years, while that of the matched control athletes was 7.6 ± 2.8 
     years (P < .001). After primary ACLR, an athlete had a 2 times 
     greater chance of retirement compared with the matched control 
     athlete (hazard ratio, 2.19; P < .001). At 5 years after ACLR, 16% of 
     athletes had retired from professional soccer, while 8.5% of the 
     matched cohort were retired (P = .060). By 10 years, 72% of the ACLR 
     cohort had retired compared with 43% of the matched cohort (P < 
     .001). Forwards were more likely to have shortened careers compared 
     with goalkeepers (P = .021); however, no significant differences were 
     observed between midfielders, defenders, and forwards. Within the 
     ACLR cohort, a contralateral ACL tear during the athlete's career 
     caused a 2.30 times (P = .022) increased chance of retirement 
     compared with athletes with only 1 ACL tear during their career. 
     Mechanism of injury, meniscal pathology, graft rerupture, and 
     chondral lesions did not affect career length. Conclusion: 
     Professional male soccer players who underwent ACLR had decreased 
     career length by approximately 1.6 years compared with a matched 
     player cohort.]

     AB: Background: Recent studies have investigated the effect of 
     psychological factors on return to sport (RTS), but none has tested 
     the existence of psychological profiles linked to reinjury anxiety 
     and its links with RTS and reinjury. Purpose: To assess the effect of 
     different psychological profiles on RTS and reinjury. Study. Design: 
     Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: The study screened 
     patients who were involved in all types of sports for anterior 
     cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (hamstring and patellar tendon 
     autografts). All participants were included during the RTS phase 
     (90-180 days after ACL reconstruction). Reinjury anxiety, fear of 
     reinjury, kinesiophobia, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, knee 
     confidence, self-esteem, optimism, coping, and pain were measured. 
     Hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward method) and analysis of variance 
     were performed. In the second year after surgery, patients were 
     recontacted by telephone to follow-up. RTS and reinjury were compared 
     by profile type. Results: A total of 162 athletes were initially 
     included, of whom 123 responded regarding RTS and reinjury. Cluster 
     analysis showed a 4-cluster solution (χ2[21] = 428.59; λ = .064; P 
     < .001). Profile 1 (27.8%) was characterized by moderate reinjury 
     anxiety and no depression. Profile 2 (22.8%) was characterized by 
     moderate reinjury anxiety and minor anxious-depressive reaction. 
     Profile 3 (30.9%) was characterized by no reinjury anxiety, no 
     depression, and high confidence. Profile 4 (18.5%) was characterized 
     by high anxiety, high depression, and low confidence. Profile 4 had 
     the lowest self-esteem and optimism scores compared with profile 3 (P 
     < .001). In addition, a higher percentage of men was found in profile 
     3 as opposed to profile 4 (χ2[3] = 11.35; P < .01). Profile 4 had 
     the highest rate of non-RTS with 54.2% (profile 1: 14.3%, P = .001; 
     profile 2: 25.0%, P = .031; profile 3: 22.2%, P = .011). Finally, 
     patients with profile 3 had a higher risk of reinjury (13.9%) than 
     those with profile 4 (0%) (P = .047), who had an extremely 
     conservative RTS. Conclusion: The different profiles will affect RTS, 
     but also the risk of reinjury exclusively for profiles 3 and 4. 
     Rehabilitation management will probably require all stakeholders to 
     understand psychological profiles of athletes to develop an on-demand 
     rehabilitation plan.]

     IS: 0363-5465]
     MD: AB]
     AB: Background: Primary repair of the anterior cruciate ligament 
     (ACL) has some potential advantages over the reconstruction 
     technique, which include but are not limited to better knee sensation 
     due to preservation of the natural ACL tissue in patients compared 
     with tendon graft. Proprioception is impaired after ACL injuries and 
     the sense of the joint position is lost. Purpose/Hypothesis: The 
     purpose of this study was to compare arthroscopic ACL primary repair 
     and ACL reconstruction techniques clinically and functionally and 
     analyze the differences in proprioception. It was hypothesized that 
     primary repair would restore knee joint proprioception more 
     successfully because the original tissue of the ACL is preserved. 
     Study. Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total 
     of 63 patients (34 underwent reconstruction and 29 underwent primary 
     repair between 2017 and 2020) and 33 healthy controls, as well as the 
     healthy knees of the operated groups, were evaluated between 24 and 
     48 months (mean, 29 months) postoperatively. Patients with proximal 
     femoral avulsion tears and stump quality suitable for repair 
     underwent primary repair, and those with tears outside these criteria 
     underwent reconstruction using hamstring tendon autograft. 
     Proprioception was evaluated using the active joint position 
     sensation method during weightbearing, with a digital inclinometer 
     used to measure differences between the target and achieved flexion 
     angles of 15°, 30°, and 60°. Results: At 15° of knee flexion, the 
     deviation angles for the healthy knee of the reconstruction and 
     primary repair groups were significantly smaller than those of the 
     control group (P < .001), but there was no statistically significant 
     difference between the groups in terms of deviation angle at 30° and 
     60° of flexion. The deviation angle of the operated knees was 
     statistically significantly larger in the reconstruction group than 
     in the primary repair group at all angles. The deviation angles at 
     15°, 30°, and 60° were 2.83°, 2.66°, and 2.66° in the 
     reconstruction group and 1.00°, 1.00°, and 1.33° in the primary 
     repair group, respectively (P < .001). There was no statistically 
     significant difference between the reconstruction and primary repair 
     groups in terms of clinical scores. Conclusion: Primary ACL repair 
     can preserve proprioception in a well-selected patient group. In 
     short-term follow-up, primary repair of the ACL in patients with 
     proximal femoral avulsion tears and stump quality suitable for repair 
     appears to be proprioceptively protective. Future studies are needed 
     to clarify the long-term consequences of primary repair on 
     proprioception in a larger population.]

     is a viable treatment option for osteochondral defects of the talus. 
     However, sufficient data are not available on patients' participation 
     in sports or recreational activities after the procedure. Purpose: To 
     assess whether patients undergoing OCA transplantation of the talus 
     participated in sports or recreational activities postoperatively. 
     Study. Design: Case series; level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 
     36 ankles in 34 patients underwent OCA transplantation of the talus. 
     At a mean follow-up of 9.2 years, information on participation in 
     sports or recreational activities pre- and postoperatively was 
     obtained, as well as postoperative pain, function, and satisfaction. 
     Results: The mean age at the time of surgery was 36.1 years (range, 
     20.5-57.7 years), and 50% of patients were men. The mean graft size 
     was 3.6 cm2 (range, 1-7.2 cm2) or 41.1% of the talar dome. Before the 
     injury, 63.9% of patients (23/36 ankles) reported being highly 
     competitive athletes or well trained and frequently sporting; 36.1% 
     of patients (13/36 ankles) reported sometimes sporting or were 
     nonsporting. Also, 66.7% of patients (24/36 ankles) were able to 
     participate in sports or recreational activities after OCA 
     transplantation and 50% (18/36 ankles) were still participating in 
     sports or recreational activities at the latest follow-up. In a 
     subset of well-trained or highly competitive athletes, 73.9% (17/23 
     ankles) were able to return to sports or recreational activities at 
     any point after OCA transplantation, and 65.2% (15/23 ankles) were 
     still participating at the latest follow-up. Further surgery occurred 
     in 16.7% of patients (6/36 ankles). Graft survivorship was 94.3% at 5 
     years and 85.3% at 10 years. There was a significant improvement in 
     the mean Olerud-Molander Ankle Scores, and the mean Foot and Ankle 
     Ability Measure scores were high postoperatively. Moreover, 79.4% of 
     patients (27/34 ankles) were either satisfied or extremely satisfied 
     with the allograft surgery. Conclusion: Fresh OCA transplantation is 
     a reasonable surgical option for osteochondral defects of the talus 
     for young, active patients who have failed previous operative 
     management or have massive defects.]

     AB: Background: It has been shown that chronic ankle instability 
     (CAI) leads to abnormalities in neuromuscular control of more 
     proximal joints than the ankle. Although strength of the hip and the 
     ankle muscles has been largely investigated providing concordant 
     results, limited evidence with contrasting results has been reported 
     regarding knee extensor and flexor muscles. Purpose: To investigate 
     maximal and submaximal isometric muscle strength in individuals with 
     CAI. Study. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Fifteen 
     participants with unilateral CAI and 15 healthy matched controls were 
     recruited. To quantify maximal strength, peak forces were recorded 
     during a maximal isometric voluntary contraction of knee extensor and 
     flexor muscles at 30° and 90° of knee flexion and normalized by the 
     body weight of each participant. At both angles, submaximal isometric 
     contractions at 20%, 50%, and 80% of the maximal voluntary isometric 
     contraction were performed to analyze strength steadiness, in terms 
     of coefficient of variation, and strength accuracy, in terms of 
     absolute error. During all the assessments, knee extensor and flexor 
     muscle activation was recorded by means of surface electromyography. 
     Results: Knee flexor maximal isometric strength was significantly 
     lower in the injured limb of individuals with CAI in comparison with 
     healthy controls at both 30° (0.15 ± 0.05 vs 0.20 ± 0.05; P < .05) 
     and 90° (0.14 ± 0.04 vs 0.18 ± 0.05; P < .05). Knee extensor and 
     flexor steadiness was significantly lower (higher coefficient of 
     variation) in both the injured and the noninjured limbs of 
     individuals with CAI in comparison with healthy individuals at 90° 
     and at 30° for knee flexor steadiness of the injured limb. Knee 
     extensor and flexor accuracy was lower (higher absolute error) in 
     both the injured and noninjured limbs of individuals with CAI in 
     comparison with healthy individuals, mainly at 30°, while at 90° it 
     was lower only in the injured limb. No differences between the 2 
     groups were found for maximal isometric strength of knee extensor 
     muscles, as well as for muscle activations. Conclusion: Individuals 
     with CAI show abnormalities in maximal and submaximal isometric 
     strength of knee flexor muscles, and submaximal strength of the knee 
     extensor muscles. Further studies should deeply investigate 
     mechanisms leading to these abnormalities. Clinical Relevance: 
     Rehabilitation interventions should consider abnormalities of 
     neuromuscular control affecting joints more proximal than the ankle 
     in individuals with CAI.]

     AB: Background: Acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation is a common 
     clinical problem among young and athletic populations. Surgical 
     management is widely used for high-grade dislocations (Rockwood 
     III-VI) and in high-demand athletes at high risk of recurrence. 
     Purpose: To systematically review the evidence in the literature to 
     ascertain the rate and timing of return to play (RTP) and the 
     availability of specific criteria for safe RTP after surgical 
     treatment for AC joint dislocation. Study. Design: Systematic review; 
     Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A systematic literature search based 
     on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
     Meta-Analyses) guidelines was conducted in the PubMed database. 
     Clinical studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported on RTP 
     after surgical treatment for AC joint dislocation. Statistical 
     analysis was performed with SPSS. Results: We found 120 studies 
     including 4327 cases meeting our inclusion criteria. The majority of 
     patients were male (80.2%), with a mean age of 37.2 years (range, 
     15-85) and a mean follow-up of 34.5 months. Most were recreational 
     athletes (79%), and the most common sport was cycling. The overall 
     rate of RTP was 91.5%, with 85.6% returning to the same level of 
     play. Among collision athletes, the rate of RTP was 97.3%, with 97.2% 
     returning to the same level of play. In overhead athletes, the rate 
     of RTP was 97.1%, with 79.2% returning to the same level of play. The 
     mean time to RTP was 5.7 months (range, 1.5-15). Specific RTP 
     criteria were reported in the majority of the studies (83.3%); time 
     to return to play was the most commonly reported item (83.3%). Type 
     III Rockwood injuries had the highest RTP rate at 98.7% and the 
     earliest RTP at 4.9 months. Among the different surgical techniques, 
     Kirschner wire fixation had the highest rate of RTP at 98.5%, while 
     isolated graft reconstruction had the earliest RTP at 3.6 months. 
     Conclusion: The overall rate of RTP was reportedly high after 
     surgical treatment for AC joint dislocation, with the majority of 
     patients returning to their preinjury levels of sport. There is a 
     lack of consensus in the literature for what constitutes a safe RTP, 
     with further focus on this topic required in future studies.]

     AB: Purpose: Concussion management is shifting away from a 
     rest-is-best approach, as data now suggest that exercise-is-medicine 
     for this mild brain injury. Despite this, we have limited data on 
     habitual physical activity following concussion. Therefore, our 
     objective was to quantify accelerometer-measured physical activity 
     and sedentary time in children with concussion (within the first 
     month of injury) and healthy controls. We hypothesized that children 
     with concussion would be less active than their healthy peers. 
     Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of prospectively collected 
     accelerometer data. Our sample included children with concussion (n = 
     60, 31 females) and historical controls (n = 60) matched for age, 
     sex, and season of accelerometer wear. Results: Children with 
     concussion were significantly more sedentary than controls (mean 
     difference [MD], 38.3 min/d, P = .006), and spent less time 
     performing light physical activity (MD, −19.5 min/d, P = .008), 
     moderate physical activity (MD, −9.8 min/d, P < .001), and vigorous 
     physical activity (MD, −12.0 min/d, P < .001); these differences 
     were observed from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Sex-specific analyses 
     identified that girls with concussion were less active and more 
     sedentary than both boys with concussion (P = .010) and healthy girls 
     (P < .010). Conclusion: There is an activity deficit observed within 
     the first month of pediatric concussion. Physical activity guidelines 
     should address this while considering sex effects.]

     AB: Purpose: The aim of this systematic review is to reveal the 
     social, personal, and contextual factors that influence physical 
     activity (PA) in children and adolescents during and after cancer 
     treatment. Method: SPORTDiscus, Cochrane, Web of Science, PubMed, and 
     FIS Education electronic database were systematically searched. 
     Results: The 13 included studies show that social support (parents, 
     siblings, and friends) in particular is rated as important by cancer 
     survivors; for example, doing PA together. Depending on the treatment 
     status and state of health, particularities arise. During the acute 
     treatment phase, parents issued more prohibitions regarding PA than 
     after treatment. The state of health and concern about infections are 
     described as inhibiting factors. Not all hospitals generally offer 
     special exercise programs for cancer patients, and in some cases, 
     only sporadic exercise sessions were conducted by specialized staff. 
     In addition, the hospital atmosphere, such as cramped rooms, tends to 
     be associated with demotivating effects. Conclusions: Both inhibiting 
     and promoting factors in the area of social, personal, and contextual 
     factors could be identified. The most fundamental factor for PA is 
     the physical condition. Social factors, such as parents or friends, 
     often have a motivating effect and can promote PA. Inhibiting factors 
     are mainly context-related, such as an environment unsuitable for PA. 
     Although the review highlights interesting aspects, further 
     treatment-related and longitudinal studies could provide deeper 
     insights.]

     AB: Objective: Compared to Western cultures, self-determination needs 
     are expressed and pursued differently in Asian cultures, where 
     interdependence and achieving greater good for the group are 
     prioritized. To accommodate these needs, we propose the use of 
     family-centered decision making (FCDM) to complement the shared 
     decision-making (SDM) practice, fostering collaborative psychiatric 
     care for Asian individuals residing in the United States. Method: 
     This article synthesizes various literature to outline the 
     similarities and differences between SDM and FCDM, discuss 
     implementation steps, challenges associated with implementation, 
     potential solutions, and future research considerations. Results: Our 
     review suggests that FCDM is more responsive to and inclusive of 
     Asian cultural experience, better reflecting these cultures' 
     expression of self-determination. We propose a five-step framework 
     for FCDM implementation in psychiatric rehabilitation for Asian and 
     Asian American individuals, while identifying three further practical 
     considerations: logistical difficulties, intrafamilial differences, 
     and making the decision to use FCDM or not. Conclusions and 
     Implications for Practice: Given the heterogeneity of Asian 
     individuals in the United States, we urge providers to allow 
     flexibility in practicing FCDM. We outline the important components 
     for providers to help individuals with psychiatric disabilities 
     distinguish between the characteristics of FCDM and SDM, evaluate the 
     potential pros and cons of utilizing FCDM, and then initiate FCDM if 
     appropriate or requested by the individuals.]

     AB: Objective: Promoting leisure participation requires a 
     collaborative approach that emphasizes personal interests, strengths, 
     and motivations. The purpose of this article was to test the 
     effectiveness of the Independence through Community Access and 
     Navigation (ICAN) intervention on community participation, recreation 
     participation, and positive emotions among individuals with 
     schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Using motivational interviewing and 
     an individualized placements and support framework, the ICAN 
     intervention focuses on working with participants to identify and 
     participate in personally meaningful leisure activities by connecting 
     with personal motivations and mainstream community opportunities. 
     Method: This randomized controlled trial was conducted with 74 
     participants diagnosed with schizophrenia with assessments conducted 
     at baseline and posttreatment. Intervention effects were examined 
     with repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multiple 
     regression analysis was also performed using a change score as an 
     outcome variable and baseline negative symptoms score, condition, and 
     interaction as predictors. Results: There was no significant main 
     effect of ICAN on positive emotions, recreation participation, or 
     community participation; however, among those in the experimental 
     group, those with impairments in motivation and pleasure experienced 
     improvements in community participation. Conclusions and Implications 
     for Practice: For individuals experiencing greater negative symptoms, 
     a supported leisure intervention may be an effective strategy to 
     explore personal motivations and increase leisure participation. 
     Future research should test the intervention effectiveness 
     specifically targeting a larger sample of individuals with more 
     severe negative symptoms.]

     AB: Objective: In Canada and elsewhere, making treatment decisions 
     for a person with serious mental illness (SMI) who was found 
     incapable for treatment decisions via a substitute decision maker 
     (SDM) is the norm. This practice is often called into question from a 
     rights-based perspective. The literature on the views of affected 
     individuals is limited. We explore the experiences of adults with SMI 
     who have had SDMs to gain more in-depth understanding. Method: We 
     conducted semistructured interviews with 11 consumers of psychiatric 
     services who have had experiences with SDM (range 1-12 years) at an 
     urban hospital in Toronto, Canada. Results: Thematic analysis showed 
     five main themes and related subthemes, including: (1) strong 
     dissatisfaction with and rejection of the SDM's role and purpose; (2) 
     pervasive sense of stigma associated with having a SDM; (3) ongoing 
     struggles to gain autonomy; (4) mixed changes in relationship with 
     and views about SDM; and (5) views on how to improve SDM process. 
     Conclusion and Implications for Practice: Our study highlights 
     substantial dissatisfaction with the current SDM system and 
     approaches among adults with SMI who have had SDMs. Issues of stigma 
     and struggles to regain autonomy are prevalent. We discuss the 
     personal, clinical, and social-legal contexts in which they occur, 
     particularly in light of the United Nations' Convention on the Rights 
     of Persons with Disabilities that calls for replacing SDMs with 
     supported decision making. Rights-based approaches to care carry 
     substantial practice implications and call for thoughtful change 
     management.]

     AB: Objective: The active recovery triad (ART) model provides 
     guidelines for recovery-oriented care in long-term mental health 
     care. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether compliance to the 
     principles of the ART model is related to recovery-oriented care, 
     service user recovery and satisfaction. Method: A prospective study 
     was conducted including two measurements, in which we investigated 
     compliance to the principles of the ART model (ART fidelity), 
     recovery-oriented care as measured by the Recovery-Oriented Practices 
     Index-Revised (ROPI-R) at team level (n = 18) and outcome measures on 
     service user level (n = 101) related to personal recovery, social 
     roles, level of functioning, clinical recovery, transition, and 
     satisfaction. We used multilevel modeling to evaluate these 
     relationships. Results: There was a significant association between 
     active recovery triad (ART) fidelity and the ROPI-R. We did not find 
     a significant association between overall ART fidelity and service 
     user outcomes. Yet, we did find that higher ART fidelity in the 
     domains "cooperation in the triad," "professionalization of staff," 
     and "team structure" were related to improved clinical recovery, 
     functioning, social roles, and performance of activities. However, 
     higher ART fidelity in the domain "healing environment" was related 
     to poorer functioning, and a higher score in the domain "safety and 
     prevention of coercion" was related to poorer social roles and 
     performance of activities. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: 
     We can conclude that compliance to the principles of the ART model is 
     related to recovery-oriented care, measured with the ROPI-R. In 
     addition, the findings suggest that in particular elements in the ART 
     model are related to meaningful recovery outcomes.]

     AB: Objective: Increasing service user involvement and collaboration 
     with providers has become an important facet of the recovery 
     movement. This study explored perspectives on the implementation and 
     delivery of an intervention (Just Do You [JDY]) designed to improve 
     treatment engagement among marginalized young adults diagnosed with 
     serious mental illnesses. Method: Informed by the Consolidated 
     Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we conducted in-depth 
     interviews (N = 11) with nine participants that included agency 
     leaders, clinical providers, and researchers involved with the 
     planning, delivery, and evaluation of JDY. We used grounded theory 
     coding techniques and constant comparison to develop themes that 
     capture the data on implementation and collaboration related to the 
     delivery of JDY. Results: Two broad themes emerged: (a) collaboration 
     between the clinician and person with lived experience and (b) 
     collaborative culture within and between organizations. Findings 
     capture how collaboration occurred between providers within the 
     clinical encounter (e.g. combined strengths of clinicians and peers) 
     and within and between organizations, clustering around several CFIR 
     domains (e.g. inner setting, process, characteristics of individuals, 
     intervention characteristics). Findings speak to the importance of a 
     "culture of collaboration" in which collaboration is occurring across 
     multiple levels of an organization to support the delivery and 
     implementation of JDY. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: JDY 
     can complement other collaborative approaches given its focus on 
     improving initial engagement. Findings point to the perceived 
     benefits of interventions that are facilitated by a clinician and a 
     person with lived experience along with how their combined expertise 
     can support recovery.]

     AB: Objective: "Serious mental illness" (SMI) is a priority 
     population within mental health treatment and policy. However, there 
     is no standard operational definition across research, clinical, and 
     policy contexts. The use of the label has also not been evaluated 
     regarding its association with stigma among the general public. This 
     mixed-method study compared community members' stigma toward "SMI" 
     with other psychiatric labels and examined community understanding 
     and perceptions of the SMI label. Method: Two hundred forty-six 
     participants recruited via Prolific read randomly manipulated 
     vignettes describing an individual diagnosed with depression, 
     schizophrenia, or "SMI" and completed measures of stigma and 
     qualitative questions regarding familiarity, understanding, and 
     perceived utility of SMI. Quantitative analyses evaluated stigma 
     across vignettes, and qualitative analyses identified common themes 
     across responses. Results: Stigma was relatively high across 
     vignettes, with more negative views reported toward SMI and 
     schizophrenia compared with depression. Quantitative differences in 
     stigma by vignette were not significant after controlling for 
     participants' age and gender. Qualitative responses were split 
     regarding the perceived utility of the SMI term, with noted concerns 
     including its broadness and potential for stigma. Most participants 
     described functional impairment or disability as characteristic of 
     "SMI," and approximately 70% associated schizophrenia and psychotic 
     disorders with "SMI" compared with 45% for depression. Conclusions 
     and Implications for Practice: Person-level factors were more 
     strongly associated with stigma than psychiatric labels. However, our 
     sample described concerns that the SMI term is vague and may 
     exacerbate stigma. Community education and antistigma efforts should 
     move beyond diagnostic labels in characterizing mental illness to 
     facilitate change in attitudes.]

     AB: Objective: Traumatic experiences are prevalent among people with 
     serious mental illness and can significantly worsen outcomes. This 
     study aimed to identify an urban cluster of trauma types, compare 
     continuous distress ratings versus categorical experience of trauma 
     for predicting outcomes such as depression and quality of life, and 
     investigate the mediating role of recovery orientation in the impact 
     of trauma exposure on outcomes. Method: Data came from an 
     intervention study on African Americans with serious mental illness 
     living in a large urban area; 212 participants completed baseline 
     self-report measures of past trauma experiences, related distress 
     levels, recovery, depression, and quality of life. Data were assessed 
     using correlations and regressive path modeling. Results: Overall, 
     56.6% of participants reported experiences with trauma. Analyses 
     suggested an urban cluster of trauma types that was self-reported by 
     over 25% of participants. Distress due to trauma strongly correlated 
     with greater depression as well as reduced quality of life and 
     recovery. Interestingly, the categorical presence of trauma history 
     (yes/no) had no significant relationship with any outcomes. Path 
     analyses revealed that recovery mediated the impact of trauma 
     distress on depression and quality of life, specifically implicating 
     the recovery subfactor of hope. Conclusions and Implications for 
     Practice: Results suggested that cognitive reframing focused on 
     positive appraisals of overall recovery, and the hope subfactor can 
     have a positive influence on trauma outcomes. The study supported the 
     role of recovery in posttraumatic growth and suggests that hope can 
     be used to help patients process trauma healthily.]

     AB: Objective: This study aimed to examine the psychometric 
     properties of the English version of the Self-Stigma Scale-Short 
     (SSS-S), a nine-item self-report self-stigma measurement, among U.S. 
     adults with psychiatric disabilities. Method: We obtained reliability 
     and validity evidence from a sample of 275 adults with psychiatric 
     disabilities. Results: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA; n = 139) 
     yielded a two-factor solution that accounts for 64.97% of the 
     variance. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; n = 136) was conducted 
     to compare alternative solutions, including a single-factor model, a 
     two-correlated-factor model, a three-correlated-factor model, and a 
     bifactorial model. The CFA results supported the bifactor S·I − 1 
     model as a superior latent factor structure for the SSS-S. The 
     coefficient ω of the SSS-S was .94, indicating excellent internal 
     reliability. Concurrent validity of the SSS-S was supported by 
     significant positive correlations with societal stigma and 
     psychiatric symptom severity, and negative correlations with 
     psychiatric disability acceptance, general self-efficacy, and hope. 
     Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The overall findings 
     concluded that the English version of the SSS-S demonstrated reliable 
     and valid scores and a primarily unidimensional structure of 
     self-stigma among U.S. adults with psychiatric disabilities. Given 
     the adverse impact of self-stigma and its relationships with 
     recovery-related constructs shown in this study, the routine use of 
     the SSS-S is recommended in psychiatric rehabilitation settings.]

     AB: Objective: The support of the personal recovery of people with 
     lived experience of mental illness is a major issue in clinical 
     practice. Thus, a valid instrument to assess personal recovery is 
     needed. The present study aimed to validate the French translation of 
     the 22-item Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery (QPR-Fr). 
     Method: A convenience sample of 222 participants reporting a severe 
     mental illness diagnosis was recruited online. Psychometric 
     properties of the QPR-Fr were evaluated. A confirmatory factor 
     analysis was conducted for structural validity. Internal consistency 
     and test-retest reliability were assessed. To test for convergent 
     validity, we conducted multiple linear regression analysis to explore 
     the QPR-Fr associations with psychological distress and the CHIME 
     framework (with Connectedness, Hope and optimism about the future, 
     Identity, Meaning in life, and Empowerment) proxy measures (perceived 
     social support, hope, self-esteem, quality of life, and empowerment). 
     Results: An adequate fit was found for a 19-item unidimensional 
     factor structure. Internal consistency was excellent. Test 
     reliability was good. The QPR-Fr total score was significantly 
     positively associated with quality of life, hope, self-esteem, and 
     social support satisfaction and negatively associated with 
     psychological distress. No significant association was found with 
     social support availability nor with empowerment. Conclusions and 
     Implications for Practice: This study provides additional data to 
     support the cross-cultural validity of the Questionnaire about the 
     Process of Recovery. The QPR-Fr is a valid and reliable tool to 
     assess personal recovery. Practitioners could use the QPR-Fr to 
     assess personal recovery in collaboration with people with lived 
     experience. Convergent validity with CHIME proxy measures supports 
     the validity of the CHIME framework in a French cultural context.]

     indicated for a variety of pathologies. Despite high nonunion rates, 
     techniques remain unchanged. The aim of this study is to examine 
     nonunion and complication rates and describe risk factors for 
     treatment failure. Methods: A query of an institutional database was 
     performed to identify all patients undergoing HIPJA procedure over a 
     10-year period. Records were reviewed to the procedure, evaluate 
     patient factors, indications, and radiographic/clinical arthrodesis. 
     Radiographic union was defined as 2 cortical continuations or 
     bridging at the arthrodesis site, absence of hardware failure, and 
     the absence of lytic gapping of the arthrodesis. Clinical fibrous 
     union was defined as radiographic nonunion with painless toe range of 
     motion and physical examination consistent with fusion across the 
     interphalangeal joint. Results: Two hundred twenty-seven primary 
     HIPJA procedures were identified. Our cohort demonstrated a 25.5% 
     nonunion rate (58/227) and 21.1% reoperation rate (48/227). Patients 
     with diabetes were at higher risk for nonunion (P = .014), but no 
     significant differences were identified based on smoking status or 
     diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis. No difference was seen between 
     implant groups: single screw, multiple screws, screw plus other 
     fixation, nonscrew fixation. Patients with prior hallux 
     metatarsophalangeal joint arthrodesis did not have a significantly 
     higher nonunion rate than patients without prior first 
     metatarsophalangeal joint arthrodesis. Patients diagnosed with 
     radiographic nonunion were at higher risk for reoperation (P < 
     .0001). Conclusion: Our cohort represents the largest single-center 
     series of HIPJA procedures published to date. We found relatively

     all-inside arthroscopic anatomical repair of anterior talofibular 
     ligament (ATFL) for management of chronic lateral ankle instability 
     (CLAI) in a considerable number of patients during medium-term 
     follow-up. Methods: A retrospective analytic study was performed on 
     100 patients with CLAI who presented between August 2015 and July 
     2020 (average age: 32.9 years; range: 16-54 years). All-inside 
     arthroscopic ATFL direct repair was performed in all patients through 
     2 portals only with fixation using 2 knotless anchors. Associated 
     intraarticular lesions were treated in the same procedure. Outcomes 
     were assessed with pre- and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS), 
     the ankle-hindfoot score of the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle 
     Society (AOFAS), and the Karlsson Ankle Functional Score (KAFS). 
     Results: All patients were followed for 24-48 months. At the final 
     follow-up, ankle pain had improved significantly. Both the ankle 
     anterior drawer test and the ankle varus stress tests were negative. 
     There was no loss of ankle range of motion compared with preoperative 
     measures, and all patients returned to normal gait. The mean VAS 
     score decreased to 0.39 ± 0.63, the AOFAS score increased to 95.17 
     ± 4.7, and the KAFS score increased to 95 ± 4.07. All the follow-up 
     indexes significantly improved compared to those before surgery. 
     Conclusion: At minimum 24-month follow-up, the all-inside 
     arthroscopic ATFL repair used to treat CLAI was found to restore 
     ankle stability and yield good clinical outcomes with a relatively 
     low complication rate.]

     AB: Background: The clinical significance of foot and ankle bone 
     marrow edema (BME) is poorly understood. Methods: Magnetic resonance 
     imaging (MRI) and the visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores were 
     collected for 17 runners who participated in the Twin Cities 
     Marathon, immediately postmarathon and at a 6-week follow-up. Bone 
     marrow edema lesions were classified using lesion frequency, 
     anatomical location, and grading scale change to calculate a BME 
     score for each affected bone. Spearman rank correlation coefficient 
     test was used to identify a possible correlation between VAS and 
     postmarathon BME. A paired Student t test was used to detect 
     differences between total mileage ran 6 weeks postmarathon in 
     participants with or without BME. Results: After completing the 
     marathon, 8 BME lesions were identified in 5 participants (29.4%; 
     5/17), 3 were men, and 2 were women, with a mean age of 33.8 years 
     (range: 24-52), and BMI of 22.9 ± 4. All lesions were resolved on 
     6-week follow-up imaging. VAS pain scores did not correlate with 
     postmarathon BME. A significant difference in total miles logged over 
     6 weeks postmarathon could not be found among participants with and 
     without BME. Conclusion: Foot and ankle BME changes identified by MRI 
     were not correlated to clinical symptoms and may resolve with 
     self-directed activity in less time than other areas of the lower 
     extremity.]

     AB: Background: Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) continues to be 
     investigated as a primary treatment for end-stage ankle arthritis. 
     The objective of this study is to report mid- to long-term results of 
     the Salto Talaris TAA using prospectively collected patient-reported 
     outcomes and implant survival rates with 4- to 13-year follow-up. 
     Methods: This was a retrospective study of prospectively collected 
     data from 2 multicenter cohort studies from 3 centers. Three hundred 
     fourteen subjects who received a Salto Talaris TAA from 2005 to 2015 
     were included in the study. Follow-up ranged 4-13 years following 
     index procedure. Outcomes included 36-Item Short Form Health Survey 
     (SF-36) mental and physical component summary scores, pain scores, 
     and adverse events including additional surgeries, revision, or 
     removal of components. Results: Significant improvements were seen in 
     pain and physical function scores at 2-year follow-up and were 
     generally maintained through most recent follow-up. The survival rate 
     of the prosthesis was >95% (n = 30/32 at >10 years, n = 272/282 at 
     4.5-10 years). Thirteen patients (4.1%) underwent revision or removal 
     of their prosthesis. Time to revision ranged from 2 months to 6.5 
     years following the index procedure. Twenty-two patients (7.0%) had 
     additional surgery that did not involve revision or removal of 
     components. Conclusion: Treatment of end-stage ankle arthritis with 
     this implant provided patients with improved pain and functional 
     outcome scores at mid- to long-term follow-up. The significant 
     improvements reported at 2-4 years appeared to endure through the 
     extended follow-up period.]

     AB: Background: The Infinity Total Ankle Arthroplasty (Stryker, 
     Mahwah, NJ) is a low-profile fixed-bearing implant first introduced 
     in 2014. Although the short-term survivorship (2-4 years follow-up) 
     and complication rates of the Infinity TAA have been reported, there 
     are limited midterm outcome reports. The aim of this study was to 
     describe the survivorship and clinical outcomes of a single-center 
     experience with the Infinity implant at minimum 5-year follow-up. 
     Methods: Retrospective review of 65 ankles that underwent primary 
     total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) with the Infinity implant was 
     conducted. Mean clinical follow-up was 6.5 years (range, 5.0-8.0). 
     Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were measured to assess 
     tibiotalar alignment, periprosthetic lucencies, and cysts. 
     Preoperative, 2-year, and 5-year postoperative Foot and Ankle Outcome 
     Score (FAOS) subscores were compared to assess midterm clinical 
     outcomes. Survivorship assessment was determined by removal of 1 or 
     both metallic implant components. Results: Survivorship of the 
     implant was 93.8% at final follow-up. There were 4 revisions: 2 for 
     tibial implant loosening, 1 for talar loosening, and 1 for loosening 
     of both components. Three of the 4 revisions occurred within the 
     first 2 years following implantation, and the last failure occurred 
     at 7 years postoperatively. There were 11 reoperations in 10 (15%) 
     ankles and 3 wound complications. There were 17 ankles (26.2%) with 
     radiographic abnormalities around the implants, including 14 cases 
     with tibial component lucencies and 4 cases of periimplant cysts. 
     FAOS outcome measurement showed general stability between 2 and 5 
     years and substantial improvement from preoperative status. 
     Conclusion: To date this study is the largest midterm report on the 
     Infinity total ankle prosthesis, with 65 implants at a mean follow-up 
     of 6.5 years. We found good midterm implant survivorship, and 
     patients experienced significant improvements in FAOS outcome scores 
     and radiographic alignment at final follow-up.]

     AB: Background: To compare the clinical, radiologic, and functional 
     outcomes between shockwave and operative treatments for proximal 
     fifth metatarsal stress fractures in soccer players in a pilot study. 
     Methods: Between 2017 and 2019, 18 soccer players with fifth 
     metatarsal stress fractures attended at Mutualidad de Futbolistas 
     Españoles-Delegación Catalana were included. Patients were randomly 
     assigned into 2 groups receiving either surgery with an 
     intramedullary screw (group 1) or high-energy focused extracorporeal 
     shockwave treatment (group 2 performed once a week for 3 weeks using 
     2000 impulses at an energy flux density of 0.21 mJ/mm2 and 4 Hz 
     frequency). Clinical (pain), radiologic (bone healing), and 
     functional (Tegner Activity Scale and American Orthopaedic Foot & 
     Ankle Society [AOFAS] ankle-hindfoot scales) outcomes before and 
     after receiving the treatment were compared between both groups. In 
     addition, ability and time to return to play was also compared 
     between groups. Results: No patients were lost to follow-up. There 
     were no statistically significant differences at last follow-up 
     between surgery and extracorporeal shockwave treatment for bone 
     healing, pain relief, AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score, Tegner score, and 
     time return to play. No complications were reported in either of the 
     2 groups. Conclusion: In this pilot study, extracorporeal shockwave 
     treatment and operative treatment were found to be equally effective 
     at reducing pain, achieving bone healing, and allowing the soccer 
     players to return to play after proximal fifth metatarsal stress 
     fractures. This study suggests that ESWT may be a good option for the 
     management of proximal fifth metatarsal stress fractures in soccer 
     players. If this approach proves successful in larger trials, the 
     shockwave approach might help avoid known complications of the 
     surgical treatment like wound problems, nerve injury, and hardware 
     intolerance. Further investigations with larger sample size should be 
     conducted in order to confirm the present conclusions.]

     AB: Background: Acid-fast bacilli(AFB) and fungi are generally 
     slow-growing, difficult to culture, and rarely the cause of 
     infection. The goal of this study was to evaluate the value of 
     routinely obtaining AFB and fungal cultures in foot and ankle surgery 
     at a US hospital. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted to 
     determine the number of positive AFB and fungal cultures out of the 
     total number of foot and ankle samples tested. Between 2014 and 2019, 
     patients who underwent surgery for a foot and ankle infection for 
     soft tissue infection, septic arthritis, infectious postoperative 
     complications were identified. Charts were reviewed to identify the 
     results of the microbiological tests performed. To determine the 
     value of running AFB and fungal cultures, the costs of each were 
     provided by the microbiology lab at our institution. Results: Of the 
     322 patient charts reviewed, there were 434 AFB and 525 fungal 
     cultures performed. None of these cultures were indicated to be 
     positive for AFB (0%), and 22 (4.19%) were positive for fungi. The 
     total labor and material costs were calculated to be $38 767. The AFB 
     cultures cost $23 967, the positive fungal cultures cost $2371, and 
     the negative fungal cultures cost $36 395.36. Conclusion: This 
     322-case series of surgically managed foot and ankle infections 
     showed 0% and 4.1% positivity rates of AFB and fungal cultures, 
     respectively. Additionally, only 20% of cases with positive cultures 
     were identified as pathologic requiring antifungal treatment. Further 
     analysis is needed to determine best practices for obtaining vs 
     declining to culture for AFB or fungal species, including assessing 
     patient outcomes in the series of culture-positive(fungal-only) 
     cases. Our results suggest that in our clinical setting of a US 
     hospital system, routine fungal and AFB cultures may not be necessary 
     but should be considered for chronic/recalcitrant infections, 
     immunocompromised patients, and those with high surgeon suspicion.]

     AB: Background: There is growing evidence that total ankle 
     arthroplasty (TAA) can safely be performed as an outpatient 
     procedure, with the benefit of decreased health care expenses and 
     improved patient satisfaction. The purpose of our study was to 
     compare readmissions, arthroplasty failures, infections, and annual 
     trends between outpatient and inpatient TAA using a large publicly 
     available for-fee database. Methods: The PearlDiver Database was 
     queried to identify outpatient and inpatient TAA-associated claims 
     for several payer types from January 2010 to October 2021. 
     Preoperative patient characteristics and annual trends were compared 
     for inpatient and outpatient TAA. International Classification of 
     Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision, diagnosis codes were used to 
     identify infections and arthroplasty failures. Complications rates 
     were compared after matching patients by age, gender, and the 
     following comorbidities: diabetes, smoking, congestive heart failure 
     (CHF), hypertension (HTN), obesity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
     Results: A total of 12 274 patients were included in the final 
     exact-matched analysis for complications, with 6137 patients in each 
     group. Outpatients had a significantly lower rate of readmission 
     within 90 days (2.6% vs 4.0%, P < .001), arthroplasty failure (4.1% 
     vs 6.9%, P < .001), and infection (2.4% vs 3.1%, P = .015). Among 
     database enrollees, outpatient TAA has risen in proportion to 
     inpatient TAA from 2019 to 2021. Conclusion: Outpatient TAA had lower 
     rates of risk-adjusted readmission, arthroplasty failure, and 
     infection compared to inpatient TAA.]

     AB: Background: This study aimed to mimic the changes from Charcot 
     neuropathic arthropathy in humans by examining the effects of 
     exposing diet-induced obese (DIO) mice to neurotrauma through a 
     regimented running protocol. Methods: Forty-eight male wild-type 
     C57BL/6J mice were obtained at age 6 weeks and separated into 2 
     groups for diet assignment. After a 1-week acclimation period, half 
     of the mice consumed a high-fat diet (60% fat by kcal) ad libitum to 
     facilitate neuropathic diet-induced obesity whereas the other half 
     were control mice and consumed an age-matched standard low-fat 
     control diet (10% fat by kcal). At age 12 weeks, half of the animals 
     from each group were subjected to a high-intensity inclined treadmill 
     running protocol, which has been previously demonstrated to induce 
     neurotrauma. Sensory testing and radiographic analyses were 
     periodically performed. Histopathologic analyses were performed post 
     killing. Results: DIO mice had significantly higher bodyweights, 
     higher body fat percentages, and lower bone mineral density than 
     wildtype control mice that were fed a normal diet throughout the 
     experiment (P < .001 for each). DIO mice displayed significantly 
     reduced sensory function in week 1 (P = .005) and this worsened over 
     time, requiring 20.6% more force for paw withdrawal by week 10 (P < 
     .001). DIO mice that ran demonstrated greater midfoot subluxation and 
     tarsal instability over all time points compared with normal-diet 
     mice that ran (P < .001). Histopathologic analyses revealed that DIO 
     mice that ran demonstrated significant changes compared with controls 
     that ran (P < .001 for each parameter). Conclusion: Changes akin to 
     the earliest changes observed in or before joint destruction 
     identified in diabetic Charcot neuropathic arthropathy in humans were 
     observed. Clinical Relevance: There is currently no standard of 
     treatment for patients with Charcot neuropathic arthropathy. This 
     study establishes a protocol for an animal model that can be used to 
     study and compare interventions to treat this disease.]

     AB: Background: The modified Lapidus arthrodesis is a standard 
     procedure to correct middle to severe hallux valgus (HV) deformities. 
     Recently, minimally invasive techniques of first metatarsocuneiform 
     joint (MCJ) resection using a Shannon burr were described. The 
     primary goal of this study is to compare the anatomical efficacy and 
     safety of first MCJ resection using a straight 2 × 13-mm Shannon 
     burr and minimally invasive technique (MIS) vs an open technique 
     using an oscillating saw. Methods: Ten pairs of fresh frozen 
     cadaveric feet were randomly assigned to open or MIS first MCJ 
     resection with subsequent systematic dissection. For the MIS 
     procedure, a dorsomedial approach was used and for the open procedure 
     a medioplantar approach was used. Cartilage removal was investigated 
     by analyzing standardized scaled photographs of the resected 
     articular surfaces with ImageJ software. Nearby structures at risk 
     were analyzed for iatrogenic violation: tibialis anterior (TA), 
     extensor hallucis longus (EHL) and peroneus longus (PL) tendons, and 
     the Lisfranc ligament complex (LLC). Results: In the MIS group, the 
     median cartilage resection was 85.9% at the cuneiform and 85.6% at 
     the metatarsal bone compared to 100% cartilage resection in open 
     technique (P < .01). Iatrogenic damage of the LLC, EHL, and TA 
     tendons was not found in any group. The PL tendon was thinned out 
     (<25% of tendon thickness) in 4 cases (40%) in the open group and in 
     1 case (10%) in the MIS group. A safe zone of 3.0 mm between the 
     articular surface of the cuneiform bone and the LLC was identified, 
     which can be resected without putting the LLC at risk when performing 
     lateral-based wedge resections. Conclusion: In this cadaver study 
     with the procedures performed by an experienced foot and ankle 
     surgeon, and using 2 different surgical approaches, we found general 
     parity between the Shannon burr MIS technique vs oscillating saw open 
     technique techniques with more risk to the PL with our open technique 
     and approximately 15% less cartilage resection with our MIS 
     technique.]

     AB: Background: The clinically relevant healing process of a ruptured 
     and repaired Achilles tendon (AT) can last more than a year. The 
     purpose of this cross-sectional study was to test if shear wave 
     tensiometry is able to detect AT loading changes between a surgically 
     managed AT rupture versus the unaffected contralateral tendon. Our 
     secondary aims were to evaluate differences in mechanical properties 
     when measured with myotonometry and morphological properties of the 
     tendons measured with ultrasonographic imaging. Methods: Twenty-one 
     patients with surgically treated AT ruptures were investigated 12-37 
     months after surgery. Tendon load was measured using a shear wave 
     tensiometer composed of an array of 4 accelerometers fixed on the 
     tendon. Shear wave speed along the Achilles tendon was evaluated at 
     different levels of ankle torque for both the operated and the 
     unaffected side. Mechanical properties of the tendons were evaluated 
     using MyotonPRO and morphological properties using ultrasonographic 
     imaging. Friedman test was used to assess differences in AT wave 
     speed, stiffness, thickness, and cross-sectional area between the 
     operated and the unaffected tendon. Results: We found a significant 
     shear wave speed difference between sides at every ankle joint torque 
     (P < .05) with a large effect size for the lowest ankle torque and 
     small to medium effect sizes for higher ankle torque. Stiffness, 
     thickness, and cross-sectional area of the operated tendon remained 
     significantly higher compared to the unaffected side. Conclusion: In 
     this cohort, we found that shear wave tensiometry can detect 
     differences between operated and unaffected AT during a standardized 
     loading procedure. The shear wave speed along the operated tendon, as 
     well as the mechanical and morphologic properties, remains higher for 
     1-3 years after a rupture.]

     AB: Background: The increasing number of total ankle arthroplasties 
     (TAAs) has led to growing evidence on the risk factors for 
     complications after surgery. However, the role of obesity in this 
     patient group has been the subject of much debate. Therefore, this 
     systematic review aimed to investigate the evidence for untoward 
     effects of obesity following TAA. Methods: We conducted a 
     comprehensive search on April 28, 2023, in MEDLINE (via PubMed), 
     Embase, and CENTRAL. Eligible observational studies reported on the 
     short- and long-term outcomes of primary TAA, comparing patients with 
     and without obesity (defined as body mass index > 30). Using a random 
     effects model, we calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% 
     confidence intervals (CIs) from 2 by 2 tables (event and nonevent in 
     the obese and nonobese primary TAA groups). Results: Nine studies 
     with 10 388 patients were eligible for inclusion in the 
     meta-analysis. We found significantly higher odds of revision in the 
     obese group compared to the nonobese group (OR = 1.68, CI: 
     1.44-1.95). However, the odds of overall perioperative complications 
     (OR = 1.55, CI: 0.50-4.80) and wound complications (OR = 1.34, CI: 
     0.29-6.20) were nonsignificantly higher in the obese group. 
     Conclusion: Based on our results, obesity may have affected long-term 
     outcomes following TAA and may have negatively affected the 
     prosthesis's survival.]

     AB: Background: First metatarsophalangeal (MTP) arthrodesis is a 
     common surgical intervention for addressing MTP pain and deformity. 
     Despite great interest on the topic of return to sport (RTS) after 
     first MTP arthrodesis in the literature, no systematic review exists 
     on this topic. The purpose of this systematic review is to 
     investigate RTS after first MTP arthrodesis. Methods: This study is a 
     systematic review using PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and MEDLINE 
     from database inception until May 10, 2023. Search algorithm used was 
     (MTPJ OR MTP OR "hallux rigidus" OR cheilectomy OR metatarsal OR 
     metatarsophalangeal) AND (arthrodesis OR fusion) AND sport. Inclusion 
     criteria were surgical intervention of first MTP arthrodesis and 
     outcomes related to sport. Results: Ten articles were included out of 
     249 articles initially retrieved. Patients (n = 450) had a frequency 
     weighted mean (FWM) age of 58.6 ± 5.1 years with a FWM follow-up 
     time of 32.1 ± 18.9 months. A total of 153 patients (reported in 
     34.0% of patients) had a FWM postoperative Foot and Ankle Ability 
     Measure Sport score of 70.4 ± 21.8 at final follow-up. For sporting 
     activities reported by multiple studies (running, yoga, golf, hiking, 
     tennis, elliptical, and biking), about 9.8% to 28.1% of patients (n = 
     69 reports) stated that sporting activity difficulty decreased, 67.2% 
     to 87.5% of patients (n = 340 reports) stated that sporting activity 
     remained the same, and 1.8% to 8.5% of patients (n = 23 reports) 
     stated that sporting activity difficulty increased after first MTP 
     arthrodesis depending on the sporting activity. One article reported 
     RTS time of 11.7 ± 5.1 weeks after first MTP arthrodesis (n = 39). 
     Conclusion: RTS after first MTP arthrodesis is highly variable 
     depending on patient and sport. Numerous different sporting 
     activities have high rates of RTS after first MTP arthrodesis, with a 
     majority of patients reporting similar or increased ability to 
     perform sporting activities after surgery.]

     AB: Objective: This study aims to evaluate the potential impact of 
     addressing goals-of-care (GOC) with selected patients in the 
     emergency department (ED), GOC documentation, hospital utilization, 
     and patient satisfaction. Method: This is a single-center, 
     retrospective, and prospective, observational convenience-sample 
     study. ED registered nurses (ED RNs) received standardized GOC 
     conversation training. Their selection criteria included a selection 
     interview, a minimum of 3 years of ED clinical experience, and 
     current employment in the ED. ED RNs used a standardized GOC 
     questionnaire. Patient inclusion criteria included age ≥18 years 
     and one or more of the following: chronic kidney disease ≥ stage 
     III, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction ≤ 40%, 
     chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with home oxygen use, and/or 
     malignancy with metastasis. GOC conversations were recorded in the 
     electronic medical record (EMR). Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining 
     Treatment (POLST) forms were completed as appropriate. Select 
     individual patient data for the 12 months prior to the conversation 
     were compared with the following 12 months. Results: Over 6 months, 
     94 of 133 patients who were approached consented to the GOC 
     discussion with the RN. All 94 enrolled patients had their GOC 
     recorded into the EMR. One-third already had a completed POLST form 
     prior to ED arrival. 50% without a POLST on ED arrival left with a 
     completed POLST. Eighty-four patients survived the index visit and 46 
     patients survived to study completion. Patient satisfaction with the 
     interaction was high: In the cohort who survived past the index 
     visit, 95% rated their experience at 4/5 or 5/5 (Likert scale, 5: 
     strongly agree, 1: strongly disagree). In the survival-to-study 
     completion cohort, 100% rated their experience as 4/5 or 5/5. 
     Subsequent median ED visits decreased by 15% (1.0-4.0 interquartile 
     range). There were no statistically significant changes in 
     hospitalizations (both decreased by 25%, 0-3.0) or intensive care 
     unit admissions (0%, 0-0). Conclusions: An ED RN-led GOC conversation 
     had high patient satisfaction and 100% GOC documentation in the EMR. 
     There was a significant increase in ED POLST form completion. There 
     were no significant changes noted in subsequent hospitalizations, 
     length of hospitalization, or intensive care unit utilization.]

     AB: Objective: Internal medicine (IM) residents discuss a patient's 
     goals of care (GOC) as part of their initial consultation. Residents 
     have described inexperience, general discomfort, limited formal 
     teaching, and prognostic uncertainty as barriers to effective GOC 
     conversations. The early COVID-19 pandemic resulted in rapid changes 
     to the healthcare system on the individual, patient, and systemic 
     level that might exacerbate and/or introduce new barriers to IM 
     residents' GOC conversations. This qualitative study examines how the 
     early COVID-19 pandemic challenged IM residents' ability to have 
     effective GOC conversations. Methods: Using a constructivist grounded 
     theory approach, participants (n=11) completed a semi-structured 
     interview. Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously using 
     an open coding, constant comparison process. Interviews were 
     completed until no new themes were identified. Results: Residents 
     self-described their GOC conversations in 5 steps: normalization of 
     the conversation, introduction of expected clinical course, 
     discussion of possible care plans, exploration of the patient's 
     values, and occasionally providing a recommendation. Residents 
     described limited structured teaching around GOC conversations and 
     instead relied on observed role-modelling and self-practice to hone 
     their skillset. Residents described an increased sense of urgency to 
     have GOC conversations due to the uncertainty of clinical course and 
     potential for rapid deterioration of patients with COVID-19. 
     Residents identified restrictive visitor policies as a significant 
     barrier that contributed to feelings of dehumanization. Residents 
     felt that these limitations affected their GOC conversations and 
     potentially resulted in discordant care plans which contributed to 
     moral distress. Conclusion: The early COVID-19 pandemic resulted in 
     several barriers that challenged residents' ability to conduct 
     effective GOC conversations. This is on the background of previously 
     reported discomfort and limited formal training in conducting GOC 
     conversations. Based on our findings, we present a conceptual model 
     involving teaching validated GOC frameworks, positive role-modelling, 
     and experiential learning to support GOC conversation education in 
     post-graduate medical education.]

     AB: Objective: To translate and adapt the Serious Illness 
     Conversation Guide for use within the Swedish healthcare setting and 
     examine the validity and acceptability of the Swedish Serious Illness 
     Conversation Guide. Methods: Three rounds of cognitive interviews 
     were conducted (T1-3); patients (T1 n = 11; T2 n = 10; T3 n = 8), 
     family members (T1 n = 5; T2 n = 2; T3 n = 2), and healthcare 
     professionals (T1 n = 6; T2 n = 6; T3 n = 5). The guide was 
     iteratively adapted based on interview feedback, clinical experience, 
     and the literature. The guide was tested on training days with 
     physicians and nurses. Results: The Swedish Serious Illness 
     Conversation Guide was found to be useful in supporting serious 
     illness conversations. Clinicians reported that some questions were 
     emotionally challenging. Explicit questions about prognosis and 
     timing were excluded. Instead, the dual approach of "hoping for the 
     best and preparing for the worst" was used to explore patients' 
     thoughts about the future. Conclusions: Patients, family members, and 
     healthcare professionals found the Swedish Serious Illness 
     Conversation Guide to be appropriate, sensitive, and responsive to 
     their needs. The Swedish Serious Illness Conversation Guide may 
     facilitate a more health-promoting approach to serious illness 
     conversations. Further research is needed to understand the impact of 
     these conversations on person-centered and goal-concordant care.]

     AB: Background: Physiotherapy in Palliative Care (PC) is effective in 
     the management of a series of respiratory, circulatory and motor 
     symptoms, and often has a positive impact on the patient's mood. The 
     Edmonton Functional Assessment Tool (EFAT) is the only existing 
     validated tool specifically designed for functional assessment in PC, 
     and its use has been recommended in clinical practice. To date, no 
     Italian version of the tool has been validated. The aim of this study 
     was to translate, cross-culturally adapt, and evaluate the 
     psychometric properties of the Italian version of the EFAT2. Method: 
     After receiving formal permission from the author, Beaton guidelines 
     for cross-cultural adaptation were followed, namely: (1) forward 
     translation; (2) a multidisciplinary focus group (including 4 
     physiotherapists, 1 physician, 3 nurses, 1 occupational therapist, 1 
     psychologist) to assess semantic, idiomatic, experiential, and 
     conceptual equivalence; (3) backward translation. The Content 
     Validity Index (CVI) was used to assess content validity of the tool. 
     Construct and concurrent validity were also evaluated. To evaluate 
     the reliability of the EFAT2-I, reliability was measured using 
     Cronbach alfa, item-total correlation, and Cohen's Kappa. Results: 
     119 patients admitted to a Palliative Care Unit (Italy) agreed to 
     participate in the study. The EFAT2-I mean score was 11.3, ranging 
     from 0 to 30. Very good CVI scores were achieved, both in terms of 
     single item validity (I-CVI) and of whole scale validity (S-CVI). 
     Positive results were obtained from construct, concurrent validity 
     assessment and measures of reliability. Discussion: The EFAT2-I 
     showed good psychometric properties and can be used as a 
     rehabilitation assessment tool in palliative care settings. The 
     validation of the Italian version will allow comparison of different 
     centres and palliative care facilities on national and international 
     levels.]

     AB: Background: Chinese patients prefer physicians to initiate 
     advance care planning (ACP) conversations, but there is no 
     appropriate tool to evaluate physicians' ACP self-efficacy level in 
     mainland China. This study aimed to translate the ACP self-efficacy 
     scale into Chinese (ACP-SEc) and measure its psychometric properties 
     among clinical physicians. Method: The original scale was translated 
     by literal translation, synthesis, and reverse translation, according 
     to Brislin's translation model. Seven experts were invited to further 
     revise the scale and evaluate the content validity. 348 physicians 
     were conveniently sampled to evaluate the reliability and validity of 
     the scale from May to June 2021 in 7 tertiary hospitals. Results: The 
     ACP-SEc contained 17 items, 1 dimension, with a total score of 17 to 
     85 points. In this study, the critical ratios of the items ranged 
     from 12.533 to 23.306, the item-total correlation coefficients ranged 
     from 0.619 to 0.839. The item-content validity index ranged from 0.86 
     to 1.00, and the average scale-level content validity index was 0.98. 
     In total, 75.507% of the total variance was explained by 1 common 
     factor. The results of confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 
     fitting indices of the modified model were desirable. The ACP-SEc was 
     moderately correlated with General Self-Efficacy Scale (r = 0.675, P 
     < .001), and it differentiated between physician groups based on the 
     knowledge level of ACP, palliative care or ACP-related training 
     experience, attitude toward ACP, willingness to initiate ACP 
     discussions with patients, and experience of discussing ACP with 
     family and friends, willingness to initiate ACP discussions with 
     family and friends (P <.05). The total Cronbach's α and test-retest 
     reliability of the scale were .960 and .976, respectively. 
     Conclusion: The ACP-SEc shows good reliability and validity, and it 
     can be used to assess the ACP self-efficacy level of physicians.]

     AB: Background: Nurses play an important role in palliative care, and 
     high-quality assessment tools can help standardize palliative-related 
     nursing behaviors, but there are no such tools in China. Objective: 
     This study aimed to revise, cross-culturally adapt, and validate the 
     Palliative Nursing Care Quality Scale (PNCQS) to provide an effective 
     tool that can help nurses in mainland China assess the quality: of 
     palliative care. Methods: This study involved a 2-steps process. 
     First, the PNCQS was translated, back-translated, and cross-cultural 
     adapted using Brislin's translation model. Second, a cross-sectional 
     study was used to evaluate the reliability and validity of the 
     revised scale. From January to February 2023, 367 nurses engaged in 
     palliative care-related nursing from 3 tertiary A general hospitals 
     were surveyed with the revised scale. The evaluation methods used in 
     this study included item analysis, test-retest reliability, internal 
     consistency, criterion-related validity, content validity, and 
     construct validity. Results: The PNCQS-Chinese included 20 items. In 
     this study, the item-total correlation coefficients ranged from 0.67 
     to 0.83 (P < .01), and the critical ratio value of the items was 
     12.10 to 23.34 (P < .01). The scale-level content validity index was 
     0.98, and the item-level content validity ranged from 0.86 to 1.00. 
     The total Cronbach's α and test-retest reliability of the scale were 
     0.96 and 0.79, respectively. Factor analysis of 20 items extracted 1 
     factor, and the contribution rate of cumulative variance was 60.03%. 
     Conclusions: PNCQS-Chinese shows acceptable validity and reliability 
     for assessing the quality of palliative care-related nursing in

     AB: Objective: An enormous need for pediatric palliative care (PPC) 
     has been reported, especially in low- and middle-income countries 
     (LMICs). However, the access to PPC is limited. This study identifies 
     the current challenges in the provision of PPC and their severity 
     from the perspective of healthcare professionals. Method: We 
     conducted a web-based descriptive cross-sectional survey among 
     healthcare professionals treating children in need of palliative care 
     in Mexico in 2019. We used convenience sampling and snowball sampling 
     to acquire participants. Results: Seventy healthcare professionals 
     from Mexico participated. Participants were 64.3% female, on average 
     45.8 (SD = 10.9) years old, had an average of 15.84 (SD = 10.4) years 
     of work experience and worked in 15 states. The three most severe 
     barriers reported were: (1) Few teams and/or networks of 
     out-of-hospital/domestic support; (2) Absence of training centres and 
     continuing medical/paramedical education in PPC; and (3) Lack of 
     legal, labor, and economic protection for parents who must stop 
     working to be with their children. The barriers related to a lack of 
     awareness and commitment, a lack of support, legal factors, and 
     working conditions were rated highest. Participants considered 
     increased awareness and better knowledge of PPC for all as the top 
     priority, and particularly emphasized the need for better education 
     and training of health professionals. Conclusion: We have identified 
     several barriers to successful palliative care (PC) provision for 
     children. Primarily, these are lack of awareness and commitment, 
     especially of the health authorities and the medical professions, 
     lack of personal and financial support, legal factors, and working 
     conditions. The need to change and improve care exists at the policy 
     level, the health professional level, and the public societal level.]

     admission and 3 days a week during follow-up. Demographic data, 
     reasons for admission to the palliative care unit, and skin lesions 
     at the time of admission and during follow-up were recorded. Results: 
     The median age of the 259 patients included in the study was 77.0 
     years (min- max, 19-108) and 54.4% were women. Dermatological disease 
     was detected in 246 patients (96.1%) at admission to the palliative 
     care unit and in 185 patients (71.4%) patients during follow-up. The 
     most common dermatological disease at admission was dry skin (n = 
     175, 67.6%), which was also the most common cause of pruritis (n = 
     29, 11.2%). The most common skin infection was dermatophytosis (n = 
     57, 22.0%) and the most common type of dermatitis was contact 
     dermatitis (n = 17, 6.6%). Nearly all tumors were benign (n = 32, 
     12.4%) and most chronic wounds were pressure ulcers (n = 96, 37.1%). 
     During hospital follow-up, the most frequent dermatitis was contact 
     dermatitis (n = 44, 17.0%), the most frequent skin infection was 
     candidiasis (n = 25, 9.7%), the most common chronic wound was 
     pressure ulcers (n = 25, 9.7%), the most common dermatological 
     disease was urticaria (n = 14, 5.4%), and all cases of pruritus were 
     associated with dry skin (n = 8, 3.1%). Conclusions: The frequency of 
     dermatological findings is high among patients receiving palliative 
     care. Therefore, dermatologists should be included in 
     multidisciplinary palliative care teams and evaluate palliative care 
     patients early and regularly.]
