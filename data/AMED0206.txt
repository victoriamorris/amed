Aims. To investigate the level of spiritual health in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from the core dimensions and to explore its associated factors. Design. A cross-sectional study. Methods. Participants were recruited from four hospitals between September 2020 and June 2021, using a convenience sampling. Older patients with COPD (n = 162) completed the demographic and disease-related information questionnaires, Function Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Scale, 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, General Self-efficacy Scale, Social Support Rating Scale, COPD Assessment Test, 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale. Descriptive statistics, Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses, t-tests, one-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression models were used. Results. Older patients with COPD have a moderate level of spiritual health. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that psychological resilience, general self-efficacy, social support, symptom burden and monthly income were associated with the core dimensions of spiritual health. Conclusion. Chinese older patients with COPD have a moderate level of spiritual health. Psychological resilience, general self-efficacy, social support, monthly income and symptom burden were associated with the core dimensions of spiritual health. Impact. This study is the first to investigate the level of spiritual health in older patients with COPD from the core dimensions and to explore its associated factors, providing a basis for developing spiritual intervention programs. Our findings can help us realize that intervention strategies of psychological resilience, general self-efficacy and social support can all be used to enhance spiritual health. Nurses should focus on the spiritual health of older COPD patients with high symptom burden and low monthly income. Patient or Public Contribution. Although we did not directly involve patients and the public because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of the study will be disseminated to patients and the public through WeChat and seminars.</ABS><PAGE>692-706</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

As the lower extremity is a linked-joint system, the contribution of movements at the hip and ankle, in addition to the knee, to gait patterns should be considered for persons with knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the relationships of joint coordination variability to OA symptoms, particularly knee pain, and joint loading is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of joint coordination variability to knee pain severity and joint loading in persons with knee OA. Thirty-four participants with knee OA underwent gait analysis. Vector coding was used to assess coordination variability during the early, mid, and late stance phase. Hip–knee coupling angle variability (CAV) during midstance was associated with Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain (r = −0.50, p = 0.002) and Visual Analog Scale pain (r = 0.36, p = 0.04). Knee–ankle CAV during midstance was associated with KOOS pain (r = −0.34, p = 0.05). Hip–knee CAV during early and midstance were associated with knee flexion moment (KFM) impulses (r = −0.46, p = 0.01). Knee–ankle CAV during early and midstance were associated with peak KFM (r = −0.51, p < 0.01; r = −0.70, p < 0.01). Moreover, knee–ankle CAV during early, mid, and late stance phase were associated with KFM impulses (r = −0.53, p < 0.01; r = −0.70, p < 0.01; r = −0.54, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that joint coordination variability may be a factor that influences pain and knee joint loading in persons with knee OA. Statement of Clinical Significance: Movement coordination of the hip, knee, and ankle should be considered in the clinical management and future research related to knee OA.</ABS><PAGE>2610-2616</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Identifying potential contributing factors for physical inactivity in people with knee osteoarthritis is vital for designing practical activity promoting interventions. Walking is a common activity, but it is unknown how gait characteristics may influence physical activity and if psychological factors, specifically fear of movement (kinesiophobia), contribute to this relationship. The aim of our study was to investigate the contributions of select gait parameters and kinesiophobia to activity levels. Cross-sectional data from 40 participants (F 24|M 16; age 57.6 ± 8.9 years; BMI 34.7 ± 7.0 kg/m2) with uni- or bilateral knee osteoarthritis were included. Physical activity and kinesiophobia were assessed by self-report using the University of California, Los Angeles activity rating scale, and Tampa scale for kinesiophobia, respectively. Gait parameters were collected with three-dimensional gait analysis while participants walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill at a self-selected speed. Higher peak sagittal plane joint moments at the ankle (ρ = 0.418, p = 0.007), and hip (ρ = 0.348, p = 0.028), faster self-selected gait speed (ρ = 0.553, p < 0.001), and less kinesiophobia or fear of movement (ρ = −0.695, p < 0.001) were independently related to higher physical activity level in adults with knee osteoarthritis. In hierarchical regression models, after accounting for covariates, only self-selected gait speed, and kinesiophobia significantly contributed to explaining the variation in physical activity level. Statement of clinical significance: Interventions aimed at improving physical activity participation in those with lower limb osteoarthritis should consider assessing the contribution of pain-related fear of movement.</ABS><PAGE>2629-2637</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The study aimed to define the load on hands using various commonly used types of crutches while walking with a full load on both legs (FL), with 20 kg partial load (PL), or with the left leg wholly unloaded (UL). Twenty-six healthy subjects used crutches with ergonomic handles, with anatomic handles (wider and softer bearing surface), and arthritis crutches (horizontal supporting area for the forearm). Sensor mats between hand and handles continuously measured the load transmitted, while sensor soles in the shoes recorded the ground reaction forces simultaneously. The load on the palm and separately the radial and ulnar halves of the palm were analyzed. With arthritis crutches, significantly lower load was transferred to the hands compared to forearm crutches (FL 3% vs. 25% of body weight, PL 8% vs. 87%, UL 12% vs. 103%). The load on hands increased significantly from FL to PL and UL for both types of crutches. The ipsilateral left hand had to bear significantly more load than the right hand. However, the feet's time-ground reaction curves showed more irregularities, and PL on the left leg was significantly higher with arthritis crutches. Anatomic handles reduced the load on the ulnar half of the palm (FL 3% vs. 5%, PL 13% vs. 18%, UL 17% vs. 23%); the radial half of the palm had a similar load to bear with both types of handles (11/11%, 31/32%, 34/35%). Arthritis crutches allow unburdening hands at the expense of gait stability. Anatomic handles reduce the load on the Guyon's canal. </ABS><PAGE>2638-2647</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

This meta-analysis investigated the effects of exercise on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores following vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in osteoporotic fractures. A literature search of PubMed, EMBASE (Elsevier), CiNAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted from database inception to October 6, 2022. Eligible studies reported osteoporosis patients over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of at least one vertebral fracture via radiography or clinical assessment. This review was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022340791). Ten studies met the eligibility criteria (n = 889). VAS scores at baseline were 7.75 (95% CI: 7.54, 7.97, I2 = 76.11%). Following initiation of exercise, VAS scores at the endpoint of 12 months were 1.91 (95% CI: 1.53, 2.29, I2 = 92.69%). ODI scores at baseline were 68.66 (95% CI: 56.19, 81.13, I2 = 85%). Following initiation of exercise, ODI scores at the endpoint of 12 months were 21.20 (95% CI: 14.52, 27.87, I2 = 99.30). A two-arm analysis demonstrated improved VAS and ODI for the exercise group compared to non-exercise control at 6 months (MD = −0.70, 95% CI: −1.08, −0.32, I2 = 87% and MD = −6.48, 95% CI: −7.52, −5.44, I2 = 46%, respectively) and 12 months (MD = −0.88, 95% CI: −1.27, −0.49, I2 = 85% and MD = −9.62, 95% CI: −13.24, −5.99, I2 = 93%). Refracture was the only adverse event reported and occurred almost twice as frequently in the non-exercise group than in the exercise group. Exercise rehabilitation post vertebral augmentation is associated with improved pain and functionality, particularly after 6 months of exposure, and may reduce refracture rate.</ABS><PAGE>2703-2712</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

In this cross-sectional study, we compared patellofemoral geometry in individuals with a youth-sport-related intra-articular knee injury to uninjured individuals, and the association between patellofemoral geometry and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined osteoarthritis (OA) features. In the Youth Prevention of Early OA (PrE-OA) cohort, we assessed 10 patellofemoral geometry measures in individuals 3–10 years following injury compared with uninjured individuals of similar age, sex, and sport, using mixed effects linear regression. We also dichotomized geometry to identify extreme (>1.96 standard deviations) features and assessed likelihood of having extreme values using Poisson regression. Finally, we evaluated the associations between patellofemoral geometry with MRI-defined OA features using restricted cubic spline regression. Mean patellofemoral geometry did not differ substantially between groups. However, compared with uninjured individuals, injured individuals were more likely to have extremely large sulcus angle (prevalence ratio [PR] 3.9 [95% confidence interval, CI: 2.3, 6.6]), and shallow lateral trochlear inclination (PR 4.3 (1.1, 17.9)) and trochlear depth (PR 5.3 (1.6, 17.4)). In both groups, high bisect offset (PR 1.7 [1.3, 2.1]) and sulcus angle (PR 4.0 [2.3, 7.0]) were associated with cartilage lesion, and most geometry measures were associated with at least one structural feature, especially cartilage lesions and osteophytes. We observed no interaction between geometry and injury. Certain patellofemoral geometry features are correlated with higher prevalence of structural lesions compared with injury alone, 3–10 years following knee injury. Hypotheses generated in this study, once further evaluated, could contribute to identifying higher-risk individuals who may benefit from targeted treatment aimed at preventing posttraumatic OA.</ABS><PAGE>78-89</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The foot is responsible for the bodyweight transfer to the ground, while adapting to different terrains and activities. Despite this fundamental role, the knowledge about the foot bone intrinsic kinematics is still limited. The aim of the study is to provide a quantitative and systematic description of the kinematics of all bones in the foot, considering the full range of dorsi/plantar flexion and pronation/supination of the foot, both in weightbearing and nonweightbearing conditions. Bone kinematics was accurately reconstructed for three specimens from a series of computed tomography scans taken in weightbearing configuration. The ground inclination was imposed through a set of wedges, varying the foot orientation both in the sagittal and coronal planes; the donor body-weight was applied or removed by a cable-rig. A total of 32 scans for each foot were acquired and segmented. Bone kinematics was expressed in terms of anatomical reference systems optimized for the foot kinematic description. Results agree with previous literature where available. However, our analysis reveals that bones such as calcaneus, navicular, intermediate cuneiform, fourth and fifth metatarsal move more during foot pronation than flexion. Weightbearing significantly increase the range of motion of almost all the bone. Cuneiform and metatarsal move more due to weightbearing than in response to ground inclination, showing their role in the load-acceptance phase. The data here reported represent a step toward a deeper understanding of the foot behavior, that may help in the definition of better treatment and medical devices, as well as new biomechanical model of the foot.</ABS><PAGE>148-163</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Squatting is a common daily activity and fundamental exercise in resistance training and closed kinetic chain programs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an experimentally induced weakness of the gluteal muscles on joint kinematics, reactions forces (JRFs), and dynamic balance performance during deep bilateral squats in healthy young adults. Ten healthy adults received sequential blocks of (1) branch of the superior gluteal nerve to the tensor fasciae latae (SGNtfl) muscle, (2) superior gluteal nerve (SGN), and (3) inferior gluteal nerve (IGN) on the dominant right leg. At the control condition and following each block, the participants were instructed to perform deep bilateral squats standing on two force plates. Hip, knee, ankle, and pelvis kinematics did not differ significantly following iatrogenic weakness of gluteal muscles. The most important finding was the significant differences in JRFs following SGN and IGN block, with the affected hip, patellofemoral, and ankle joint demonstrating lower JRFs, whereas the contralateral joints demonstrated significantly higher JRFs, especially the patellofemoral joint which demonstrated an average maximum difference of 1.43 x body weight compared with the control condition. When performing a deep bilateral leg squat under SGN and IGN block, the subjects demonstrated an increased center of pressure (CoP) range and standard deviation (SD) in mediolateral compared with the control condition. These results imply that squat performance changes significantly following weakness of gluteal muscles and should be considered when assessing and training athletes or patients with these injuries.</ABS><PAGE>164-171</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Introduction. Hamstring strain injury (HSI) remains a performance, economic, and player availability burden in sport. High-speed running (HSR) is cited as a common mechanism for HSI. While evidence exists regarding the high physical demands on the hamstring muscles in HSR, meta-analytical synthesis of related activation and kinetic variables is lacking. Methods. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, SportDiscus, and Cochrane library databases was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Studies reporting hamstring activation (electromyographic [EMG]) or hamstring muscle/related joint kinetics were included where healthy adult participants ran at or beyond 60% of maximum speed (activation studies) or 4 m per second (m/s) (kinetic studies). Results. A total of 96 studies met the inclusion criteria. Run intensities were categorized as “slow,” “moderate,” or “fast” in both activation and kinetic based studies with appropriate relative, and raw measures, respectively. Meta-analysis revealed pooled mean lateral hamstring muscle activation levels of 108.1% (95% CI: 84.4%–131.7%) of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) during “fast” running. Meta-analysis found swing phase peak knee flexion internal moment and power at 2.2 Newton meters/kilogram (Nm/kg) (95% CI: 1.9–2.5) and 40.3 Watts/kilogram (W/kg) (95% CI: 31.4–49.2), respectively. Hip extension peak moment and power was estimated as 4.8 Nm/kg (95% CI: 3.9–5.7) and 33.1 W/kg (95% CI: 17.4–48.9), respectively. Conclusions. As run intensity/speed increases, so do the activation and kinetic demands on the hamstrings. The presented data will enable clinicians to incorporate more objective measures into the design of injury prevention and return-to-play decision-making strategies.</ABS><PAGE>2423-2443</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Studies examining the effect of protein (PRO) feeding on post resistance exercise (RE) muscle protein synthesis (MPS) have primarily been performed in men, and little evidence is available regarding the quantity of PRO required to maximally stimulate MPS in trained women following repeated bouts of RE. We therefore quantified acute (4 h and 8 h) and extended (24 h) effects of two bouts of resistance exercise, alongside protein-feeding, in women, and the PRO requirement to maximize MPS. Twenty-four RE trained women (26.6 ± 0.7 years, mean ± SEM) performed two bouts of whole-body RE (3 × 8 repetitions/maneuver at 75% 1-repetition maximum) 4 h apart, with post-exercise ingestion of 15 g, 30 g, or 60 g whey PRO (n = 8/group). Saliva, venous blood, and a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy were taken at 0 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h post-exercise. Plasma leucine and branched chain amino acids were quantified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) after ingestion of D2O. Fifteen grams PRO did not alter plasma leucine concentration or myofibrillar synthetic rate (MyoFSR). Thirty and sixty grams PRO increased plasma leucine concentration above baseline (105.5 ± 5.3 μM; 120.2 ± 7.4 μM, respectively) at 4 h (151.5 ± 8.2 μM, p < 0.01; 224.8 ± 16.0 μM, p < 0.001, respectively) and 8 h (176.0 ± 7.3 μM, p < 0.001; 281.7 ± 21.6 μM, p < 0.001, respectively). Ingestion of 30 g PRO increased MyoFSR above baseline (0.068 ± 0.005%/h) from 0 to 4 h (0.140 ± 0.021%/h, p < 0.05), 0 to 8 h (0.121 ± 0.012%/h, p < 0.001), and 0 to 24 h (0.099 ± 0.011%/h, p < 0.01). Ingestion of 60 g PRO increased MyoFSR above baseline (0.063 ± 0.003%/h) from 0 to 4 h (0.109 ± 0.011%/h, p < 0.01), 0 to 8 h (0.093 ± 0.008%/h, p < 0.01), and 0 to 24 h (0.086 ± 0.006%/h, p < 0.01). Post-exercise ingestion of 30 g or 60 g PRO, but not 15 g, acutely increased MyoFSR following two consecutive bouts of RE and extended the anabolic window over 24 h. There was no difference between the 30 g and 60 g responses.</ABS><PAGE>2470-2481</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objective. Exaggerated exercise blood pressure (BP) is independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. However, it is unknown how individual CVD risk factors may interact with one another to influence exercise BP. The aim of this study was to quantify direct and indirect associations between CVD risk factors and exercise BP, to determine what CVD risk factor/s most-strongly relate to exercise BP. Methods. In a cross-sectional design, 660 participants (44 ± 2.6 years, 54% male) from the population-based Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study had BP measured during low-intensity fixed-workload cycling. CVD risk factors were measured, including body composition, clinic (rest) BP, blood biomarkers, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Associations between CVD risk factors and exercise BP were assessed using linear regression, with direct and indirect pathways of association assessed via structural equation model. Results. Sex, waist-to-hip ratio, fitness, and clinic BP were independently associated with exercise systolic BP (SBP), and along with age, had direct associations with exercise SBP (p < 0.05 all). Most CVD risk factors were indirectly associated with exercise SBP via a relation with clinic BP (p < 0.05 all). Clinic BP, waist-to-hip ratio, and fitness were most-strongly associated (direct and indirect association) with exercise SBP (β[95% CI]: 9.35 [8.04, 10.67], 4.91 [2.56, 7.26], and −2.88 [−4.25, −1.51] mm Hg/SD, respectively). Conclusion. Many CVD risk factors are associated with exercise BP, mostly with indirect effects via clinic BP. Clinic BP, body composition, and fitness were most-strongly associated with exercise BP. These results may elucidate how lifestyle modification could be a primary strategy to decrease exaggerated exercise BP-related CVD risk.</ABS><PAGE>2509-2515</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Fourteen male distance runners who ran at least 40 km per week ran barefoot on a force-instrumented treadmill in four conditions representing preferred running speed (mean (SD) 3.1 (0.3) m/s) and 20% increased running speed (3.8 (0.4) m/s), with and without 20% of body weight carried in a weight vest. Kinematics and kinetics were synchronously collected. Bending moments were estimated about the medial-lateral axis of the tibial centroid located 1/3rd of the length from distal to proximal. Static equilibrium was ensured at each 1% of stance. Peak bending moments were obtained in addition to cumulative-weighted loading, where weighted loading accounted for the relative importance of the magnitude of the bending moment and the quantity of loading using a bone-dependent weighting factor. Results. There were no interaction effects for running speed and weight carriage on peak or cumulative tibial loading. Running at a 20% faster speed increased peak and cumulative loading per kilometer by 8.0% (p < 0.001) and 4.8% (p < 0.001), respectively. Carriage of an additional 20% of body weight increased peak and cumulative loading per kilometer by 6.6% (p < 0.001) and 8.5% (p < 0.001), respectively. Interpretation. Increasing the physical demand of running by increasing speed or weight carriage increased peak tibial loading and cumulative tibial loading per kilometer, and this may increase the risk of tibial stress injury. Running speed and weight carriage independently influenced tibial loading.</ABS><PAGE>2516-2523</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The present study compared the ipsilateral repeated bout effect (IL-RBE) and contralateral repeated bout effect (CL-RBE) of the elbow flexors (EF) and knee flexors (KF) for the same interval between bouts to shed light on their mechanisms. Fifty-two healthy sedentary young (20–28 years) men were randomly assigned to the IL-EF, IL-KF, CL-EF, and CL-KF groups (n = 13/group). Thirty maximal eccentric contractions of the EF were performed in IL-EF and CL-EF, and 60 maximal eccentric contractions of the KF were performed in IL-KF and CL-KF, with a 2-week interval between bouts. Changes in muscle damage markers such as maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity, and proprioception measures before to 5 days post-exercise were compared between groups. Changes in all variables were greater (p < 0.05) after the first than second bout for all groups, and the changes were greater (p < 0.05) for the EF than KF. The changes in all variables after the second bout were greater (p < 0.05) for the CL than IL condition for both EF and KF. The magnitude of the average protective effect was similar between CL-EF (33%) and CL-KF (32%), but slightly greater (p < 0.05) for IL-EF (67%) than IL-KF (61%). These demonstrate that the magnitude of CL-RBE relative to IL-RBE was similar between the EF and KF (approximately 50%), regardless of the greater muscle damage for the EF than KF. It appears that the CL-RBE is more associated with neural adaptations at cerebrum, cerebellum, interhemispheric inhibition, and coricospinal tract, but the IL-RBE is induced by additional adaptations at muscles.</ABS><PAGE>2548-2560</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Rehabilitation clinicians strive to encourage children's sustained effort within challenging practice conditions. Effort influences intervention success, yet it is rarely defined or measured. Effort can be conflated with individual factors, such as motivation and engagement, that might influence it. Contextual factors that likely impact children's effort, such as practice conditions and therapeutic interactions, are generally under-described. Defining, describing, and measuring effort and its influencers is necessary to enhance understanding of differences in rehabilitation intervention outcomes across individuals and contexts and to support the development of personalized precision rehabilitation approaches. This narrative review describes effort conceptualization in rehabilitation, particularly in relation to intensity, engagement, and participation nomenclature. The review outlines individual and contextual factors that may influence children's effort in rehabilitation and describes potential next steps for effort description and measurement. Subsequent work should aim to identify factors that can be targeted in clinical practice to promote and sustain children's effort in the rehabilitation process, thereby individualizing interventions and potentially improving their effectiveness.</ABS><PAGE>23-31</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Aim. To examine whether designed-to-be-rigid ankle–foot orthoses and footwear combinations with individualized alignment and footwear designs (AFO-FC/IAFD) would be more effective than designed-to-be-rigid AFO with non-individualized alignment and footwear designs (AFO-FC/NAFD) in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Method. Nineteen children with bilateral spastic CP were randomized to AFO-FC/NAFD (n = 10) or AFO-FC/IAFD (n = 9) groups. Fifteen were male, average age 6 years 11 months (range 4 years 2 months–9 years 11 months), classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels II (n = 15) and III (n = 4). The Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS), Gait Outcomes Assessment List (GOAL), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), and Orthotic and Prosthetic Users' Survey (OPUS) measures of satisfaction were collected at baseline and after 3 months' wear. Results. Compared with the AFO-FC/NAFD group, those with AFO-FC/IAFD demonstrated greater change in PBS total scores (mean 12.8 [standard deviation 10.5] vs 3.5 [5.8]; p = 0.03) and GOAL total scores (3.5 [5.8] vs −0.44 [5.5]; p = 0.03). There were no significant changes in OPUS or PROMIS scores. Interpretation. After 3 months, individualized orthosis alignment and footwear designs had a greater positive effect on balance and parent-reported mobility than a non-individualized approach. No effect was documented for the PROMIS and OPUS. Results may inform orthotic management for ambulatory children with bilateral spastic CP.</ABS><PAGE>52-60</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Aim. To report the test–retest reliability of the parent version of the Gait Outcomes Assessment List (GOAL) questionnaire for item, domain, total score, and goal importance in children with cerebral palsy (CP) functioning in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I to III. Method. The GOAL questionnaire was completed twice, 3 to 31 days apart, in a prospective cohort study of 112 caregivers of children aged 4 to 17 years with CP (40% unilateral; GMFCS level I = 53; II = 35; III = 24; 76 males). All had an outpatient visit over a 1-year period. The standard error of measurement (SEM), minimum detectable change, and agreement were calculated for all responses, including goal importance. Results. The SEM for the total score was 3.1 points for the cohort (GMFCS level I = 2.3, GMFCS level II = 3.8, GMFCS level III = 3.6). The standardized domain and item scores were less reliable than the total score and varied according to GMFCS level. The gait function and mobility domain exhibited the best reliability for the cohort (SEM = 4.4), whereas the use of braces and mobility aids domain exhibited the lowest (SEM = 11.9). Goal importance was reliable (cohort average agreement 73%). Interpretation. The parent version of GOAL has acceptable levels of test–retest reliability for most domains and items. Caution is advised when interpreting the least reliable scores. Essential information necessary for accurate interpretation is provided.</ABS><PAGE>61-69</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Aim. To evaluate the factor structure of the 49 goal prioritization questions of the Gait Outcome Assessment List (GOAL). Method. This was a retrospective review of 622 consecutive individuals diagnosed with cerebral palsy (median = 11 years 2 months, SD = 6 years 0 months, 370 male), who underwent a routine clinical gait analysis at a specialty center and completed the validated GOAL. To assess dimensionality, we performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on the goal ratings of its 49 gait-related items. For internal consistency, we calculated Cronbach's alpha. We created standardized goal scores for each factor and determined floor and ceiling effects according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Results. Factor analyses suggested that the GOAL's 49 goal prioritization items represented eight factors, one more than the original GOAL validation because pain and fatigue were separated into distinct factors. Cronbach alphas were acceptably high (≥0.80) across factors except for use of braces and mobility aids (α = 0.68). Goal importance varied across domains and GMFCS levels. Interpretation. The GOAL can be expanded as a tool to better understand goal priorities in ambulatory individuals with cerebral palsy. These scores can be used to guide clinical conversations and provide more focus than previously available when faced with 49 individual goals. Scores can also be aggregated across relevant populations for larger-scale studies.</ABS><PAGE>70-81</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Aim. To determine the feasibility and reliability of measuring grip strength and its association with anthropometrics and diseases among adolescents and adults (≥16 years old) with cerebral palsy (CP). Method. In this cross-sectional study, individuals with CP, classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)/Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) levels I to V, were recruited to measure grip strength, anthropometrics, and self-reported current/history of disease during a routine clinical visit. Feasibility was determined as the proportion recruited/consented/completed testing. Test–retest reliability of three maximal effort trials per side was assessed. Linear regression determined associations of grip strength with anthropometrics after adjusting for age, sex, and GMFCS. The predictive ability of GMFCS alone, grip strength alone, GMFCS + grip strength, and GMFCS × grip strength for diseases was compared. Results. Of 114 individuals approached, 112 participated and 111 successfully completed all tasks. There was good to excellent reliability of test–retest grip strength between trials for dominant and non-dominant sides for the entire cohort and when stratified by each GMFCS and MACS level (intraclass correlation coefficient range 0.83–0.97). Sex, GMFCS, MACS, body mass, and waist circumference were associated with grip strength (p < 0.05), but not hip circumference, waist:hip ratio, or triceps skinfold thickness. Modeling grip strength with GMFCS had a higher predictive value for relevant diseases than GMFCS alone. Interpretation. Grip strength is a feasible and reliable measurement for CP, and is associated with some demographics and anthropometric measures. Grip strength, in addition to the GMFCS, enhanced prediction of disease outcomes.</ABS><PAGE>87-94</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

To investigate spoken language comprehension (SLC), single-word comprehension (SWC), functional communication development, and their determinants, in children with cerebral palsy. Method. This was a prospective cohort study in the Netherlands spanning 2 years 6 months. The main outcomes were SLC and SWC, assessed by the Computer-Based instrument for Low motor Language Testing (C-BiLLT) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III-NL (PPVT-III-NL) respectively; and functional communication, measured by a subscale of the Focus on the Outcomes of Communication Under Six-34 (FOCUS-34). Linear mixed models were used to determine developmental trajectories, which were compared with norm and reference data. Potential determinants, for example intellectual functions, speech production, functional communication level (classified with the Communication Function Classification System, CFCS), and functional mobility, were added to assess their effects. Results. Children with cerebral palsy (n = 188; mean age 59 months, range 17–110) were monitored for 2 years 6 months. Developmental trajectories for SLC (C-BiLLT) and SWC (PPVT-III-NL) were nonlinear; those for functional communication (FOCUS-34) were linear. Compared with norm and reference groups, significantly delayed SLC, SWC, and functional communication development were found. Determinants for SLC and SWC were intellectual functions and functional communication level (CFCS); and for functional communication development (FOCUS-34), speech production and arm–hand functioning. Interpretation. Children with cerebral palsy showed delayed SLC, SWC, and functional communication development compared with norm and reference groups. Remarkably, functional mobility was not associated with the development of SLC, SWC, or functional communication.</ABS><PAGE>95-105</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Ball possessions and game rhythm are promising variables to better understand teams' collective behaviour during a basketball game. However, the role of these variables is not well documented in teams with intellectual impairments (II). This study aimed to explore ball possession and game rhythm differences between II and non-II basketball games. Methods. Data were obtained through video observations (53 II games) and the International Basketball Federation records (53 non-II games). Results. Independent t-tests (P ≤ 0.05) revealed that the number of ball possessions was higher and game rhythm was faster in II games. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (P ≤ 0.05) showed that ball possessions and game rhythm developed differently throughout the II games compared with the non-II games. Conclusions. The differences may be due to the decision-making, tactical and self-regulatory limitations of players with II. These limitations adequately explain why players with II respond differently to the environmental cues and monitor insufficiently their actions compared with players without II. Additionally, the higher number of ball possessions and the faster game rhythm in II games could be an indicator of more intuitive, and thus faster, game-related decision-making. In conclusion, the study provides further understanding of the role of cognition in basketball and contributes to better explain the differences between II and non-II games.</ABS><PAGE>23-33</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Skills such as planning and problem solving that are required in self-determination can be cognitively demanding. It has not yet been examined whether executive functions and intelligence are associated with levels of self-determination in individuals with intellectual disability (ID), and how that is related to quality of life (QoL). This study examined the associations among executive functions, intelligence, self-determination, and QoL in adolescents with ID. Methods. Seventy-nine adolescents aged between 17 and 20 years with mild ID participated in the study. Executive functions were assessed by experimental tasks. Non-verbal IQ and survey data regarding QoL and self-determination capacity were collected from the participants. Results. In a regression model with QoL as the dependent variable, only executive planning and self-determination capacity (but not working memory, inhibition and IQ) were significant predictors of QoL. Two mediation models were tested based on the hypotheses, literature and current findings. Model 1 revealed that executive planning had a negative direct effect on QoL when the mediator, self-determination capacity, was held constant. Model 2 indicated that the significant association between self-determination and QoL was not mediated by executive planning. Conclusions. The findings highlighted the crucial significance of self-determination, in comparison with executive functions and intelligence, for improving the QoL in adolescents with ID. Importantly, higher executive planning skill was even associated with lower QoL if self-determination was not concurrently strengthened. These findings carry implications for the design of education and intervention programmes aimed at improving QoL of adolescents with ID.</ABS><PAGE>53-63</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

In adults with an intellectual disability, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is often measured by proxy report. This cross-sectional study investigated whether the mental health of proxy raters impacts the way they rate HRQoL. Methods. In this study, 110 carers of adults with an intellectual disability completed measures of psychological distress (Kessler-6) and HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) about their own HRQoL and that of the care recipient. Differences between HRQoL scores as rated by the carer about themselves and the care recipient were calculated (convergence scores) and multiple regression models were fitted to estimate the association between proxy psychological distress and convergence scores for subjective/objective HRQoL controlling for support needs of the care recipient, carer age and gender of care recipient. Results. There was a significant association between psychological distress and subjective HRQoL convergence scores (r = .92; P = 0.03; 95%; CI: −1.76 to −0.09). There was no association between psychological distress and objective HRQoL convergence scores (r = .01; CI −0.02 to 0.001; P = 0.08). The association between psychological distress and HRQoL scores was no longer present when models did not include convergence scores. Conclusions. Carers experiencing more psychological distress tended to rate their own and the care recipients' subjective HRQoL more similarly. Objective HRQoL measures did not show this convergence in scores with increasing carer psychological distress. Findings differed when the analysis approach was changed, suggesting the results above require replication in future studies.</ABS><PAGE>74-83</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. This study reports the process evaluation of the In-Dialogue conversation aid to facilitate shared decision-making with people with intellectual disabilities in the palliative phase. Methods. Training for In-Dialogue was evaluated by 53 support staff members through questionnaires. The use of In-Dialogue in four residential care facilities for frail people with mild to severe intellectual disabilities was evaluated with semi-structured interviews with five relatives, nine support staff and three people with intellectual disabilities. Results. Most participants considered the training helpful to apply shared decision-making. Sixty-three people with intellectual disabilities participated in In-Dialogue conversations. Almost all interviewees stated that these conversations provided additional insight into people's concerns and preferences. Involvement of people with profound intellectual disabilities and their relatives appeared to be challenging. Conclusion.

This measure includes domains relating to an individual's physical, mental, and social functioning. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric characteristics of the CPADULT. Method. Caregivers (n = 47; 77% female, 23% male) of individuals with severe disabilities who are non-ambulatory completed the questionnaire. Internal consistency, test–retest reliability and construct validity were analysed. Results. Internal consistency was adequate with Cronbach's alpha values from 0.75 to 0.95. Test–retest reliability was good, as intraclass correlation coefficient of the total score was 0.84 (domains: 0.61–0.89). Construct validity was confirmed with significant differences between subgroups of motor or intellectual abilities. Conclusion. The CPADULT has sufficient reliability and validity as a proxy measure of health-related quality of life for adults with severe disabilities who are non-ambulatory.</ABS><PAGE>e13160</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Effects of staff provided positive behaviour support (PBS) for individuals with intellectual disabilities are unclear. Method. Using a multicentre non-randomised cluster controlled design, 26 teams of residential group homes, including 245 staff members of 167 individuals with intellectual disabilities, were allocated to a PBS or control group. Conducting multilevel analyses (n = 123) we examined individuals' changes in irritability, other challenging behaviours and quality of life. Results. Compared to controls, irritability did not significantly decrease more in the intervention group, but lethargic behaviours did. Personal development and self-determination significantly increased. Irritability of individuals in the PBS group with higher levels of irritability or lower levels of intellectual disability significantly reduced more compared to controls. Conclusions. PBS was effective in reducing irritability of individuals with severe levels of irritability or intellectual disabilities. Moreover, PBS decreased lethargic behaviours and improved several domains of quality of life.</ABS><PAGE>e13164</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The aim of this article is to present explicit and implicit attitudes of occupational therapy (OT) staff towards people with intellectual disabilities. The study was conducted on a group of 77 OT employees. To explore the explicit attitude, the Conditional Respect for Persons with Disabilities Questionnaire (Kurtek, Roczniki Psychologiczne, 2018, 4, 327–344) was used, while to estimate the implicit attitude, the Intellectual Disability Attitudes Implicit Association Test was applied (Kurtek, Roczniki Psychologiczne, 2021, 1, 43–64). At the explicit level, OT staff tended to tolerate negative and overrate positive behaviours of people with intellectual disabilities, which indicates a tendency to favour the individuals. However, the opposite devalorizing tendency was observed at the implicit dimension, which indicates aversive ableism. Although the study confirmed the independence of the two dimensions of the personnel's attitude, relationships were observed between the disclosure of negativity towards antagonistic behaviours of the people with intellectual disabilities and a decrease in the level of their implicit devaluation.</ABS><PAGE>e13171</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Investigate differences in SB levels and patterns of adults with DS based on sex, age, and residence-type across weekdays and weekends. Methods. Thirty-four adults with DS (15 men; 37 ± 12 years) underwent accelerometry-based measurements of sedentary time, bouts, and breaks for 7 days. We evaluated differences with 2 × 2 mixed-model (group-by-day) ANOVA. Results. Younger (19–36 years) individuals had less sedentary time (p = .042), and shorter (p = .048) and fewer (p = .012) bouts than older (37–60 years) individuals.

Introduction. Narratives are enriched by taking the perspective of the protagonists, which can be expressed using reported speech. Nevertheless, the use of reported speech is unaddressed internationally among individuals with Down syndrome. Method. Narratives of 28 children and adolescents with Down syndrome were collected using a non-verbal picture book. Occurrence and forms of reported speech were analysed and compared to typically-developing children (TD; n = 33). Results. Participants from both populations use reported speech in their narratives with a comparable proportion. Nevertheless, differences appear concerning forms of direct speech with persons with Down syndrome using more free direct speech than TD-children. Discussion. The results suggest that children and adolescents are able to implement the use of reported speech regardless of their syntactic impairments. Concerning the occurring forms of direct speech, the results might point to cognitive impairments that manifest in limited consideration of the interlocutor's knowledge.</ABS><PAGE>e13163</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Burnout and secondary traumatic stress (STS) are problems for the workforce supporting people with developmental disabilities. This study investigated hope as a potential protective resource for burnout and STS among the developmental disability services workforce. Method. One hundred and fifty-two non-supervisor caseworkers from a state agency, developmental disabilities division were recruited to participate in an anonymous web-based survey. Results. The analyses showed that hope was negatively associated with the three dimensions of STS (intrusion, avoidance, and arousal) and burnout. Controlling for tenure in the workforce and STS, the results of the hierarchical regression analyses showed that hope accounted for a significant incremental variance to burnout. Conclusion. These findings provide support for emerging literature showing hope as a protective resource to workforce burnout.</ABS><PAGE>e13184</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. The Personal Outcomes Scale (POS) is a scale developed to measure quality of life of adults (18+) with intellectual disability. Previous studies have reported good fit for Spanish and Portuguese language versions of POS. Aims. This study aimed to evaluate the factor structure of the English language version of POS when used to measure the quality of life of adults (18+) with intellectual disability in the UK. Materials and Methods. Analysis was conducted on POS data from 310 adults with an intellectual disability. First and second order factor models and multi-level models were used to assess fit. Results. There was poor fit to the data for all tested models. We estimated that 23% of variance in POS scores was accounted for by interviewer cluster. Discussion. This was the first UK-based evaluation of POS and our data did not confirm the factor structure of the POS measure. The identification of systematic variability within the dataset indicates that inter-rater reliability is a potential limitation of the POS tool. Conclusion. Further research is needed to investigate inter-rater reliability of POS interviewers and to explore factor structure.</ABS><PAGE>e13189</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. How psychological resilience influences postoperative outcomes remains poorly characterized. We tested the hypothesis that psychological resilience is associated with lower odds of death or new inability to walk independently and other outcomes at 60 days after hip fracture surgery. Methods. This was a pre-planned secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial comparing spinal versus general anesthesia for hip fracture surgery. We analyzed data on 1360 adults aged 50 years or older who were hospitalized for hip fracture surgery at one of 46 US or Canadian hospitals and provided psychological resilience data preoperatively as measured via the Brief Resilience Scale. Major exclusions were the inability to walk without human assistance before fracture and contraindications to spinal anesthesia. Death or new inability to walk independently at 60 days after surgery was the primary outcome; death or new nursing home residence at 60 days and 60-day mortality were secondary outcomes. Results. Greater psychological resilience was associated with lower odds of death or new inability to walk at day 60 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.77; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.98; p = 0.03). We observed a similar association between psychological resilience and outcomes among patients who did not experience complications after surgery (aOR 0.72; CI 0.55 to 0.94, p = 0.02), but not those who had complications (aOR 1.00; CI 0.59 to 1.69, p = 0.99). Psychological resilience was associated with lower odds of 60-day death or new nursing home residence (aOR 0.73; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.93; p < 0.001) but not with 60-day mortality (aOR 0.92; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.49; p = 0.73). Conclusions. Psychological resilience is associated with better outcomes for older adults after hip fracture surgery, but largely among those who do not have postoperative complications. Future interventions may focus on improving psychological resilience preoperatively or providing support to patients with lower psychological resilience.</ABS><PAGE>3792-3801</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of telehealth, which posed unique challenges for the provision of care to older adults who face numerous barriers to accessing and using technology. To improve older adults' online health-related abilities, the UCSF Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (UCSF-GWEP) partnered with Little Brothers Friends of the Elderly-San Francisco (LBFE-SF) to develop a model telehealth training intervention. Methods. LBFE-SF recruited older adults from their members with wi-fi and paired each one with a new device and volunteer trainer to cover seven lessons and four key tasks (emailing providers, video visits, accessing health information, and using patient portals). Older adults completed surveys to self-assess their skill level after training, and their confidence before, immediately after, and 3 months post training. A subset of trainees were also interviewed about their program goals and experiences. UCSF-GWEP conducted statistical analyses of survey data, and coded interview transcripts to identify aspects of the model supportive to learning and success. Results. Of 43 participants, 31 completed training. Their median age was 75; 48% were non-white; 45% had no more than a high school education; and 63% reported yearly income below U.S. $20,000. Three months after completing the program, more than 50% of trainees reported that they needed little or no help performing all four key tasks, and confidence with video visits, online searches, and patient portals showed significant improvement. Additionally, in interviews participants reported improved health, social benefits, and explained that learning was facilitated by self-pacing, repetition, and longitudinal support from volunteer trainers. Conclusions. Older adults with various barriers to learning technology showed online independence and increased confidence with some telehealth tasks after a novel training intervention. Key characteristics of the model included a tablet device, one-on-one longitudinal support from volunteers, comprehensive learning materials, and community–academic partnership. </ABS><PAGE>3886-3895</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Kinetic asymmetries during sit-to-stand have been consistently observed early after total knee arthroplasty; however, the longer-term outcomes are less clear. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the results of studies examining inter-limb kinetic symmetry during sit-to-stand performance among individuals who were at least one-year post unilateral total knee arthroplasty. Methods. PubMed, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Health Source databases were searched. Studies were included if they were published in a peer-reviewed journal, included subjects who had undergone unilateral total knee arthroplasty at least one-year prior, and examined vertical ground reaction forces and/or knee extension moments for the involved and uninvolved limbs during sit-to-stand performance. Data were transformed into a limb symmetry index, which expressed the ratio of the peak forces/moments for the involved limb, relative to the uninvolved limb (1.0 reflects perfect symmetry). These ratios were meta-analyzed using the ratio of means method. Findings. Seven studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Ground reaction force data was pooled from seven studies and knee extension moment data was pooled from two studies. For the peak vertical ground reaction forces, the pooled limb symmetry index was 0.96 (CI95% = [0.93, 0.99]). For the peak knee extension moments, the pooled limb symmetry index was 0.91 (CI95% = [0.84, 0.98]). In both cases this reflects greater limb/knee loading for the uninvolved limb, relative to the involved limb. Interpretation. Asymmetries in limb/knee loading persist beyond the one-year post-operative period following total knee arthroplasty, potentially contributing to degenerative changes for the uninvolved limb.</ABS><PAGE>106103</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Breast cancer-related lymphedema is a common complication after breast cancer treatment.This study examined isokinetic proprioception, muscular strength, and endurance by comparing extremity with lymphedema and the extremity without lymphedema in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema. Methods. A total of 15 individuals aged between 35 and 70 years participated in this study. Cybex Humac NORM Isokinetic dynamometer (CSMi, Stoughton, MA) were used to assess upper extremity passive proprioception, active proprioception, kinesthesia, muscle strength, and muscle endurance. The upper extremity lymphedema was measured with the water displacement arm volumetry test using a volumeter. Findings. All isokinetic measurements demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the extremity with lymphedema and the extremity without lymphedema, suggesting lower scores in the extremity with lymphedema (p < .05). There was a positive correlation between passive internal rotation in the extremity with lymphedema and the time after mastectomy (r= 0.628, p = .012) and a moderate positive relationship was found between the time after lymphedema and passive internal rotation (r = 0.577; p = .024), and active external rotation position sense (r = 0.540; p = .038) in the extremity with lymphedema. Also, a unidirectional positive moderate (r = 0.594; p = .020) relationship was found between the lymphedema stage and passive external rotation in the extremity with lymphedema. Interpretation. The difference in proprioception, muscle strength, and endurance between the extremity with lymphedema and the extremity without lymphedema in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema will provide valuable information in terms of prioritizing these parameters in treatment. </ABS><PAGE>106100</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. People with knee osteoarthritis walk with excessive muscle co-contraction that can accelerate disease progression. Central pain sensitization is common in people with knee osteoarthritis and may be related to walking patterns. The objective of this study was to examine the relation of central pain sensitization with muscle co-contraction during walking in people with knee osteoarthritis. Methods. This study reports secondary analysis from baseline data of two clinical trials (n = 90 participants with knee osteoarthritis). The presence of central pain sensitization was measured by mechanical temporal summation at the patella and the wrist. Quadriceps and hamstrings activation was assessed using surface electromyography during walking at self-selected and fast paces. Muscle co-contraction indices for vastus medialis-medial hamstrings and vastus lateralis-lateral hamstrings muscle pairs were calculated during stance phases. Co-contraction outcomes were compared between people with and without mechanical temporal summation at each site, adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. Findings. People with mechanical temporal summation at the knee had greater vastus lateralis-lateral hamstrings co-contraction while walking at a fast pace (P = 0.04). None of the other differences was statistically significant, but the overall trends and effect sizes indicated greater co-contraction in people with temporal summation at the knee irrespective of gait phase, walking speed, or muscle pairs. Interpretation. Central pain sensitization, assessed as mechanical temporal summation at the knee, is related to greater knee muscle co-contraction during fast walking in people with knee osteoarthritis. Thus, mitigating central sensitization may be an interventional target to reduce muscle co-contraction for people with knee osteoarthritis.</ABS><PAGE>106105</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Alterations in vibration perception among children and adolescents with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease might explain observed changes in foot posture. Therefore, this cross-sectional study compared the vibration perception of the lower limbs in youths with and without Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and verified the cut-off value of the distal vibration perception for the Charcot-Marie-Tooth group. In addition, associations between dynamic plantar pressure, vibration perception and isometric muscle strength were investigated. Methods. Participants aged 9–18 (Charcot-Marie-Tooth group n = 32; Typical group n = 32) had vibration perception measured by a 128-Hz graduated tuning fork. The static and dynamic foot posture were evaluated by the Foot Posture Index and pressure distribution measuring system, respectively. For the Charcot-Marie-Tooth group, a hand-held dynamometer evaluated the isometric muscle strength of the lower limbs. Findings. Children with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease presented impaired vibration perception at the distal phalanx of the hallux and head of the first metatarsal compared to their typically developing peers, while adolescents with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease showed impairment in all the tested regions compared to their typically developing peers. The cut-off value for vibration perception for participants with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease was 5.7, considering the original grade of the tuning-fork 128 Hz. Among the associations established for the Charcot-Marie-Tooth group, a greater vibration perception at the distal phalanx of the hallux was associated with a longer rearfoot contact time (β = 31.02, p = 0.04). Interpretation. These new findings may guide the clinical evaluation and rehabilitation treatment for children and adolescents with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.</ABS><PAGE>106114</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Restoring the ability to walk with a prosthesis is considered a fundamental rehabilitation goal after transfemoral amputation. An essential prerequisite for achieving this goal is adequate force transmission between the prosthesis and the body. Does bone anchorage of an artificial limb permit a more normal force transmission? Methods. Data of 15 healthy subjects, nine amputees fitted with bone-anchored prostheses, nine amputees using socket prostheses, and 18 patients with a total hip replacement were included in this multicenter, observational study. Ground reaction force was measured using Kistler force plates. Kinematics was recorded with 12 Vicon Bonita cameras. Subjects were instructed to walk at three different speeds: first at their self-selected, then at slow, and finally at fast speed. Findings. Self-selected walking speeds of subject groups were significantly different, osseointegrated amputees walked the slowest. The lowest ground reaction force was measured for osseointegrated amputees on the prosthetic side, who also showed the highest force on their contralateral side. Patients with hip replacements showed values similar as healthy subjects. The vertical center of gravity movement was specific for each subject group. Interpretation. The force transmission capacity of the bone-anchored prosthetic leg is limited during walking and is lower than both in socket prostheses users without symptoms and patients with total hip replacement. Therefore, active amputees well fitted with a socket prosthesis who consider a transition to bone-anchorage should be advised that their walking speed may decrease with high probability, and that their self-selected walking speed may even be slower than 3 km/h.</ABS><PAGE>106099</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Comparing the groups, there was significant difference in Berg Balance Scale (p:0.036); Health Assessment Questionnaire/Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (p:0.001); Static balance-center (p:0.001), front (p:0.001), back (p:0.001), left (p:0.001), right (p:0.021); proprioception-front (p:0.025);Reaction Time-front (p:0.031) and left (p:0.010);Travel Time-front (p:0.041) and left (p:0.014) in favor of healthy group.In Systemic Sclerosis, disease severity had moderate correlation with static balance-back (r:-0.504,p:0.020).Skin thickness had low correlation with Reaction Time-front (r:-0.449,p:0.041).Age had low correlation with Travel time-front (r:0.458,p:0.037) and proprioception-left (r:0.450,p:0.041); moderate with Travel time-back (r:0.515;p:0.017) and proprioception-front (r:0.539,p:0.012). Interpretation. Compared to healthy, Systemic Sclerosis had worse health status, functional balance, static/dynamic balance and proprioception.This situation is related to disease severity, skin thickness and age. Evaluations made with objective methods may have the potential to determine the extent of the problem.Clinicians can guide the treatment of patients with SSc by evaluating their static/dynamic balance and proprioception.With early treatment, additional problems that may occur due to worsening of balance and proprioception can be prevented.Proprioception and dynamic balance evaluation can be performed for older patients, static balance when disease activity is high, and dynamic balance when skin thickness score is high.</ABS><PAGE>106122</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Spinal orthosis applications are preferred for conservative treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and holistic biomechanical approaches are recommended. Methods. This was single-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled study. It included 42 patients (29 females/13 males) aged 10–18 years with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, Cobb angle of 20°–45°, who were deemed suitable for spinal orthosis use. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: control, spinal orthosis group (n = 21), and insoles and spinal orthosis group (n = 21). All participants used spinal orthoses for 3 months. This study evaluated the functional capacities, quality of life, balance, and plantar pressures of the participants. The evaluations were repeated after 1 week, and 3 months following spinal orthosis application. Findings. Statistically significant difference and positive effect were observed in Cobb angle (p = 0.008; p = 0.878, respectively), right total (p = 0.037; p = 0.193, respectively), left total (p = 0.037; p = 0.193, respectively), left rearfoot (p = 0.002; p = 0.708, respectively), and right forefoot plantar pressure (p = 0.001; p = 0.739, respectively) in participants in insoles and spinal orthosis group compared with those in the control group. Statistically significant differences and positive effects were observed in swing length (p = 0.001; p = 0.053, respectively) and functional capacity (p = 0.005; p = 0.220, respectively), which are parameters related to postural balance. No change was found in quality of life of either group (p > 0.05). Interpretation. Insoles may have positive impact on functional capacity, balance, and plantar pressure during long-term follow-up in individuals with scoliosis. Therefore, the evaluation of foot plantar pressure in individuals with scoliosis is recommended, and personalized insoles may be a beneficial option.</ABS><PAGE>106121</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Patients suffering from a diabetic foot ulcer often receive a non-weight bearing prescription of the affected limb to promote healing. Total unilalteral offloading of the affected foot necessitates walking aids that require loading at the hands during ambulation. Excessive loading at the hands can increase of the risk of crutch palsy. In addition, certain walking aids can also be more strenuous and less comfortable to use than others, resulting in lower prescription compliance. This study aimed to investigate hand loading, rates of perceived exertion, and usability of typically prescribed walking aids in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. Methods. Twenty patients (12 F | 8 M, 61.0 ± 10.36 yrs., 90.54 ± 13.34 kg, 1.71 ± 0.08 m) walked as much as 200 m without assistance and with crutches, walkers, and a wheeled knee walker instrumented with flexible force-sensing pads on walking aid handles. Patients rated exertion using a Modified Borg Scale and completed a System Usability Scale questionnaire after each walking condition with or without walking aids. Findings. Results show that using a wheeled knee walker required 94% less hand loading than crutches and walkers. Patients reported 45% lower exertion with the WKW compared to crutches and walkers, and scored the usability of the wheeled knee walker 106% higher than crutches and walkers. Interpretation. The wheeled knee walker could be the preferred walking aid for total unilateral offloading because of the reduced loading demand at the hands, lower exertion during use, and greater usability compared to crutches and walkers.</ABS><PAGE>106124</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. This study assessed the use of dual-energy computed tomography (CT) to evaluate sub-calcaneal plantar fat pad changes in people with diabetic neuropathy. Methods. Dual-energy CT scans of people with diabetic neuropathy and non-diabetic controls were retrospectively included. Average CT values (in Hounsfield Units) and thickness (in centimeters) of the sub-calcaneal plantar fat pad were measured in mono-energetic images at two energy levels (40 keV and 70 keV). The CT values measured in patients with diabetic neuropathy were correlated to barefoot plantar pressure measurements performed during walking in a clinical setting. Findings. Forty-five dual-energy CT scans of people with diabetic neuropathy and eleven DECT scans of non-diabetic controls were included. Mean sub-calcaneal plantar fat pad thickness did not significantly differ between groups (diabetes group 1.20 ± 0.34 cm vs. control group 1.21 ± 0.28 cm, P = 0.585). CT values at both 40 keV (−34.7 ± 48.7 HU vs. −76.0 ± 42.8 HU, P = 0.013) and 70 keV (−11.2 ± 30.8 HU vs. -36.3 ± 27.2 HU, P = 0.017) were significantly higher in the diabetes group compared to controls, thus contained less fatty tissue. This elevation was most apparent in patients with Type 1 diabetes. CT values positively correlated with the mean peak plantar pressure. Interpretation. Dual-energy CT was able to detect changes in the plantar fat pad of people with diabetic neuropathy.</ABS><PAGE>106126</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Lateral intra-articular varus osteotomy is an L-shaped osteotomy of the lateral tibial condyle to correct mild knee valgus and lateral plateau malunion of the proximal tibia. In order to minimize injury, it was modified to preserve the posterolateral cortex and the upper tibiofibular joint. The aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of modified lateral intra-articular varus osteotomy by comparing the biomechanical strength with lateral intra-articular varus osteotomy. Methods. Twenty-four synthetic tibia models were divided into 2 groups based on osteotomy type. Each model was then fixed with 2 commonly used plate systems. Biomechanical tests were conducted to measure parameters including construct stiffness, wedge displacement, and the number of failed specimens, and the results were compared among different groups. Findings. No significant difference was found in construct stiffness among all groups (P > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in wedge displacement among all groups (P > 0.05). When an axial load of 1500 N was applied, the number of failed specimens showed no significant difference among all groups (P > 0.05). The main failure pattern was additional fracture lines on the lateral tibial plateau. Interpretation. The findings indicate that there was no significant difference in stability between the 2 groups under the tested loading conditions. Furthermore, it appears that preserving the posterolateral cortex may have no impact on biomechanical stability.</ABS><PAGE>106128</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. High tibial osteotomy surgery is a widely successful joint-preserving procedure which alters the hip-knee-ankle axis which can delay the progression of osteoarthritis; however, conventional osteotomy surgical procedures do not adequately control the posterior tibial slope. This study aimed to determine the key variables influencing posterior tibial slope during high tibial osteotomy and provide a simple means of implementing the findings during pre-operative planning. Methods. A virtual cohort of twenty-eight proximal tibia geometries of knee osteoarthritis patients was used in the study. Firstly, absolute posterior tibial slope values were contrasted using anatomical and posterior mechanical axis measurement approaches. Secondly, the influence of variables affecting posterior tibial slope change during osteotomy surgery was investigated using 3D preoperative planning surgical simulation and analytical modelling. Findings. There was a poor correlation (R2 = 0.38) between the different clinical measurements of posterior tibial slope; with an average of 7.0 ± 1.3° and 14.8 ± 2.2° respectively. An analytical solution for the change in posterior tibial slope was derived based on the hinge axis angle and the osteotomy opening angle. For three different opening angles (6°, 9° and 12°) and seven different hinge axis orientations (−30° to +30°), the results obtained were identical for the analytical model and the 3D preoperative planning. Interpretation. This study determined that the key variables affecting posterior tibial slope during high tibial osteotomy are the osteotomy opening angle and the hinge axis orientation. The derived formula provides a simple means of determining the change in posterior tibial slope resulting from a particular surgical approach.</ABS><PAGE>106125</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Proximal junctional kyphosis is a common long-term complication in adult spinal deformity surgery that involves long-segment posterior spinal fusion. However, the underlying biomechanical mechanisms of the impact of osteoporosis on proximal junctional kyphosis remain unclear. The present study was to evaluate adjacent segment degeneration and spine mechanical instability in osteoporotic patients who underwent long-segment posterior thoracolumbar fusion. Methods. Finite element models of the thoracolumbar spine T1-L5 with posterior long-segment T8-L5 fusion under different degrees of osteoporosis were constructed to analyze intervertebral disc stress characterization, vertebrae mechanical transfer, and pedicle screw system loads during various motions. Findings. Compared with normal bone mass, the maximum von Mises stresses of T7 and T8 were increased by 20.32%, 22.38%, 44.69%, 4.49% and 29.48%, 17.84%, 40.95%, 3.20% during flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation in the mild osteoporosis model, and by 21.21%, 18.32%, 88.28%, 2.94% and 37.76%, 15.09%, 61.47%, −0.04% in severe osteoporosis model. The peak stresses among T6/T7, T7/T8, and T8/T9 discs were 14.77 MPa, 11.55 MPa, and 2.39 MPa under lateral bending conditions for the severe osteoporosis model, respectively. As the severity of osteoporosis increased, stress levels on SCR8 and SCR9 intensified during various movements. Interpretation. Osteoporosis had an adverse effect on proximal junctional kyphosis. The stress levels in cortical bone, intervertebral discs and screws were increased with bone mass loss, which can easily lead to intervertebral disc degeneration, bone destruction as well as screw pullout. These factors have significantly affected or accelerated the occurrence of proximal junctional kyphosis.</ABS><PAGE>106132</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Maintaining normal patellar alignment is important for knee health. Altered activation of individual quadriceps muscles have been found related to patellar alignment. However, the relationships between strength and passive stiffness of the quadriceps and patellar alignment remains unexplored. Methods. Participants aged between 60 and 80 years with activity-induced knee pain were recruited. Knee pain was quantified using an 11-point numeric rating scale. Quadriceps strength was assessed using a Cybex dynamometer and passive stiffness of rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis were measured by shear-wave ultrasound elastography. Patellar alignments were assessed using MR imaging. Linear regression was used to examine relationships between quadriceps properties and patellar alignments with and without controlling for potential covariates. Findings Ninety-two eligible participants were assessed (71.7% females, age: 65.6 ± 3.8 years; pain scale: 4.6 ± 2.0), most of whom had knee pain during stair climbing (85.9%). We found that 17% of patellar lateral tilt angle could be explained by lower quadriceps strength (adjusted R2 = 0.117; P < 0.001), especially in females (R2 = 0.281; P < 0.001; adjusted R2 = 0.211; P < 0.001). In addition, a higher stiffness ratio of vastus lateralis/medialis accounted for 12% of patellar lateral displacement (adjusted R2 = 0.112; P = 0.008). Interpretation. Quadriceps strength and relative stiffness of lateral to medial heads are associated with patellar alignment in older adults with knee pain. It suggests that quadriceps weakness and relatively stiffer lateral quadriceps may be risk factors related to patellar malalignments in the elderly.</ABS><PAGE>106131</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is thought to be an influential etiology of myelopathy, as thickened ligamentum flavum causes the stenosis of the vertebral canal, which could subsequently compress the spinal cord. Unfortunately, there was little information available on the effects of cervical OLF on spinal cord compression, such as the relationship between the progression of cervical OLF and nervous system symptoms during dynamic cervical spine activities. In this research, a finite element model of C1-C7 including the spinal cord featured by dynamic fluid-structure interaction was reconstructed and utilized to analyze how different types of cervical OLF affect principal strain and stress distribution in spinal cord during spinal activities towards six directions. For patients with cervical OLF, cervical extension induces higher stress within the spinal cord among all directions. From the perspective of biomechanics, extension leads to stress concentration in the lateral corticospinal tracts or the posterior of gray matter. Low energy damage to the spinal cord would be caused by the high and fluctuating stresses during cervical movements to the affected side for patients with unilateral OLF at lower grades.</ABS><PAGE>104062</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The goal of the current investigation is to determine the breast tumor size-dependent MNP (Magnetic nano-particle) dose (mg/cm3) that can induce the required therapeutic effects during magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia (MNH). The investigation is done through the MNH simulations on the tumor models generated from DCE_MRI DICOM images of breast cancer from TCIA (‘The Cancer Imaging Archive’). Five tumor models are created from MRI data using 3D slicer software having size range of 3 cm3 to 15 cm3. The FEM-based solver (COMSOL multi-physics) is used to simulate bioheat transfer physics in all five extracted models. Single and multi-point injection strategies have been adopted to induce MNP in tumor tissues. The required MNP dose that may induce necessary therapeutic effects is evaluated by comparing the therapeutic effects produced by constant dose (CD) (5 mg/cm3) and variable reduced dose (RD) (5.5–2.8 mg/cm3) methodologies. Results show that for the requisite therapeutic effects, injected MNP doses (mg/cm3) should not remain constant as the size of the tumor increases. In fact, MNP dose  (mg/cm3) should be reduced as the size of the tumor increases. Results also show that RD works better with a multi-injection strategy than a single injection of MNP. It has been found that the effective MNP dose  (mg/cm3) is reduced by 50 % for the biggest tumor size (15 cm3) using multi-injection MNP delivery with respect to the smallest tumor (3 cm3) selected in this study.</ABS><PAGE>104068</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objective. The abnormal plantar pressure of flatfoot patients is a common condition. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of custom-molded insole on the plantar pain of flatfoot Methods. 105 patients (representing 174 feet) participated in evaluating a custom-made orthotic insole from June 2018 to March 2019. The height of the navicular tubercle (HNT) and the deflection angle of calcaneus (DAC) in flatfoot patients after using orthotic insoles for 6 months were recorded by X-ray imaging and scanning measurements. Plantar pressure on metatarsals 1–5 was measured by using an RSscan system. Results. Without the use of an orthotic insole, mean HNT was 0.99±0.34 cm and mean DAC was 20.0 ± 3.78 ° during the bearing weight. After using the insole, mean HNT and DAC values reduced to 0.87±0.30 cm and 14.3 ± 3.45 °, respectively (P < 0.05). Hindfoot plantar pressure did not change significantly (P > 0.05). Furthermore, pressure at metatarsals 1–3 decreased by 48.5 %, 45.6 %, and 14.3 %, respectively; that at metatarsals 4–5 increased by 33.3 % and 137.5 %, separately, when using the custom-made insole. Conclusions. Visual analog scale score for plantar pain was significantly reduced. These findings indicate that metatarsal pain of flatfoot patients might be the cause of load imbalance in plantar foot.</ABS><PAGE>104070</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Computer-controlled treadmills are common in many gait labs and offer great potential for conducting perturbation-based postural studies. However, the time-course of these disturbances can be too brief to be controlled manually through product software. Here we present a system that combines a Bertec® split-belt treadmill with custom hardware and software to deliver postural disturbances during standing and record data from multiple sources simultaneously. We used this system to administer to 15 healthy participants an 8-session perturbation-based training protocol in which they learned to respond without stepping to progressively larger perturbations. Kinematic, electromyographic, and force data were collected throughout. Motion capture was used to characterize the accuracy and repeatability of the treadmill-delivered perturbations with respect to duration, displacement, and peak velocity. These (observed) data were compared to that expected based on software commands and the known constraints of the treadmill (i.e., 10 Hz operating speed). We found perturbation durations to be as expected. Peak velocities and displacements were slightly higher than expected (average increases were 0.59 cm/s and 1.76 cm, respectively). Because this increase in magnitude was consistent, it did not impede training or affect data analysis. Treadmill behavior was repeatable across 95 % of trials.</ABS><PAGE>104071</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

This study compared two previously published generic MSK models and a modified model to estimate tibiofemoral reaction forces (TFRF) during gait, sit-to-stand, and stand-to-sit. The estimated tibiofemoral reaction forces were compared with an in vivo dataset from six patients using an instrumented knee prosthesis. A correlation and root mean square error (RMSE) in the time-series analysis and relative peak error (RPE) were evaluated. The results showed that the three MSK models were similar in estimating the vertical forces, with a large correlation, and RPE was found around 20 % during gait. The RMSE and the RPE indicated that the modified model had lower total and lateral compartment forces errors for sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit, showing the best performance. The shear forces for all tasks and models showed significant errors. Future MSK studies should consider these findings when researching functional tasks. The modified model was found to be more effective in estimating the vertical tibiofemoral joint reaction forces in tasks that impose greater demands on muscle forces and require high knee and hip flexion.</ABS><PAGE>104074</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

This review and meta-analysis examine the effects of aerobic exercise training on central arterial stiffness in obese individuals. News. Original articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Coachrane from January 2005 to December 2021. Fixed-effects modeling was used to compare changes between pre- and post-interventions and control group. Comparisons between pre- and post-interventions (n = 13 studies) reveals a significant decrease in central PWV [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.263; confidence interval (CI) 95%: 0.101 to 0.426, p = 0.001]. However, comparisons between control and exercised individuals (n = 4 studies) show no significant differences in central PWV [SMD: 0.241 (CI 95%, −0.116 to 0.599), p = 0.186]. Conclusion. In conclusion, aerobic exercise training reduces central arterial stiffness in obese adults. These results are of clinical relevance since it might be associated with reduced cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality.</ABS><PAGE>769-779</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The present research has a double fold objective. Firstly, it aims at determining whether incorporating blow darts as part of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for people with spinal cord injuries (SCI) is feasible and safe. One secondary objective is to provide information regarding its effects on their respiratory function. Equipment and methods. Fifteen people (ASIA Impairment Scale A–D) were assigned either to a blow darts group (intervention group [IG], n = 8, 44.3 ± 8.0 years), or to a non-blow darts group (control group [CG], n = 7, 48.4 ± 7.2 years). The IG completed a blow darts program based on the performance of 3 to 4 one-hour weekly sessions for 17 weeks, as part of their rehabilitation. The CG continued to receive the usual care. Feasibility of the program was recorded. Participants also performed spirometry to determine volumes and pulmonary flows and respiratory muscle strength tests to assess their maximum static mouth pressures. Results. Recruitment and completion rate for the IG were both 100%, whereas adherence to the program stood at 62.5%. After completing the program, neither group experienced significant changes in the variables assessed. However, the IG showed evidence for a possibly beneficial effect in peak expiratory flow (PEF) and maximal inspiratory pressures (MIP), with a large effect size (ηp2 = 0.377 and 0.199, respectively). Conclusions. A 17-week blow darts program was a feasible rehabilitation approach in a group of SCI individuals. Further studies with greater statistical power are recommended to determine its impact on respiratory parameters.</ABS><PAGE>790-798</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

While resistance exercise increases plasma free fatty acids and mobilizes kinases activity, the direct effect of resistance exercise on skeletal muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors delta (PPARδ) remained unclear. The present study investigated the acute and training effects of resistance exercise on PPARδ protein content and its association with serum lipid profile. Equipment and methods. Seventeen young males (n = 8) and females (n = 9) performed a 10-week progressive resistance exercise-training regimen. Body composition was measured before, at the midpoint, and after the training. Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained 24 hours before and after the first exercise and 24 hours after the last exercise to assess PPARδ content. Blood samples were collected immediately before and after, and 24 hours after the first and the last exercises. Results. PPARδ content acutely increased 49.1 ± 28.7% after exercise when adjusted for body fat percentage, and the increase was inversely proportional to body fat percentage (R = −0.877). The acute change in PPARδ was associated with the initial lean mass (R = 0.789) before training. After training, PPARδ content increased 114.7 ± 31.9% and was inversely associated with resting serum total cholesterol (TC) (R = −0.731) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) (R = −0.746). Ten-week Lean mass gain was associated with greater changes in resting serum TC (R = 0.592), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (R = 0.616), and LDL (R = 0.587). Conclusion. The associations among altered serum lipid profile, lean mass gain, and the increased PPARδ protein content induced by resistance exercise suggest that resistance exercise may alter lipid metabolism and play a role in lean mass gain through PPARδ.</ABS><PAGE>818-826</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Introduction. Body weight reduction is often used for addressing lifestyle-related diseases, and for slimming down or improving the competitiveness of athletes. It is known that high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels can be increased by habitual exercise, while low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels may not always be decreased by dietary restriction or exercise. We hypothesized that the levels of not only HDL-C, but also LDL-C improve more with body weight reduction by a combined diet-and-exercise regimen than that by a diet-only regimen. Summary of facts and results. Six healthy young adult male volunteers participated in two 10-day crossover experiments (20 days total). The first 5 days comprised an adjustment period (energy intake, 2521 ± 304 kcal/day (mean ± standard deviation)). During the second 5-day period, participants either reduced their energy intake to 1261 ± 152 kcal/day, or reduced their energy intake to 1891 ± 228 kcal/day and exercised on a bicycle ergometer to consume 630 ± 76 kcal/day. Decreases in the serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and apolipoprotein (apo) B levels were significantly larger, and decreases in the HDL-C and apo A1 levels were significantly smaller with the diet-and-exercise regimen than with the diet-only regimen. Consequently, the atherosclerosis index (AI: (TC–HDL-C)/HDL-C ratio) was significantly lower, and the degree of its reduction was significantly larger, after the diet-and-exercise regimen than after the diet-only regimen. Conclusion. These results suggest that reducing the body weight by a combination of diet and exercise has more beneficial effects on cholesterol metabolism, including changes in apo levels, than diet alone in healthy young adults.</ABS><PAGE>850-854</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. This systematic review aimed to analyze the effects of different exercise protocols on physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and body composition), quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, and sleep quality in patients with different types of cancer undergoing neoadjuvant treatment. Design. Systematic review. Method. A comprehensive search of existing literature was carried out using four electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library (published until October 19, 2022). All databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental investigations, and pre-post investigations assessing the effects of exercise in cancer patients during neoadjuvant treatment. Excluded articles included multicomponent interventions, such as exercise plus diet or behavioral therapy, and investigations performed during adjuvant treatment or survivorship. The methodological quality of each study was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Results. Twenty-seven trials involving 999 cancer patients were included in this review. The interventions were conducted in cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment for rectal (n = 11), breast (n = 5), pancreatic (n = 4), esophageal (n = 3), gastro-esophageal (n = 2), and prostate (n = 1) cancers, and leukemia (n = 1). Among the investigations included, 14 utilized combined exercise protocols, 11 utilized aerobic exercise, and two utilized both aerobic and resistance training separately. Exercise interventions appeared to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, body composition, and quality of life, although many investigations lacked a between-group analysis. Conclusion. Despite limited evidence, exercise interventions applied during neoadjuvant treatment demonstrate promising potential in enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, body composition, and overall quality of life. However, a scarcity of evidence remains on the effects of exercise on cancer-related fatigue and sleep quality. Further research with high-quality randomized controlled trials is warranted.</ABS><PAGE>586-592</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. Tendons play a crucial role allowing the storage and release of mechanical energy during the running cycle. Running kinematics, including duty factor, constitute a basic element of the runner's biomechanics, and can determine their performance. This study aimed to analyze the link between Achilles tendon and plantar fascia morphology and running parameters, considering the influence of wearing shoes versus running barefoot. Design. Cross-sectional study. Methods. 44 participants (30 men and 14 women) engaged in two running sessions, one with shoes and one without, both lasting 3 min at a consistent speed of 12 km/h. We captured running kinematic data using a photoelectric cell system throughout the sessions. Before the trials, we measured the thickness and cross-sectional area of both the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia using ultrasound. Results. The Pearson test revealed a significant correlation (p < 0,05) between Achilles tendon and plantar fascia morphology and contact time (r > − 0.325), flight time (r > − 0.325) and duty factor (ratio of ground contact to stride time) (r > − 0.328) during barefoot running. During the shod condition, no significant correlation was found between connective tissue morphology and kinematic variables. Conclusions. In barefoot running, greater size of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia results in a reduced duty factor, attributed to longer flight times and shorter contact times.</ABS><PAGE>593-598</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

A systematic review</TEXT><ABS>Abstract. Objectives. To determine the influence of severity and direction (craniocaudal length vs cross-sectional area) of intramuscular tendon tears in the lower limb on return-to-play times, compared to muscle injuries without intramuscular tendon involvement. Design. Systematic review with meta-analysis. Methods. AMED, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, ScienceDirect, PubMed (MEDLINE) and Web-of-Science were searched from inception to 31st July 2023, retrieving 666 records, of which nine were deemed eligible. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed on time to return-to-play for British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification ‘b’ vs ‘c’. Results. On the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool, one study had low risk of bias and eight had high risk. Using a best-evidence synthesis, no strong evidence emerged for a difference in time to return-to-play between injuries with or without intramuscular tendon involvement. Moderate evidence was found for an association between increased return-to-play time and the presence of “waviness” on magnetic resonance imaging and loss of tendon tension, but no association with longitudinal extent of tendon involvement. Pooled analysis revealed a medium effect-size difference between British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification ‘b’ and ‘c’ injuries, favouring classification ‘b’ (Hedges g = 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.20 to 1.15; P = 0.002). Conclusions. It remains difficult to provide an accurate prognosis for muscle injuries involving the intramuscular tendon due to high risk of bias and moderate heterogeneity across studies. Moderate evidence favoured the prognosis for injuries at the musculotendinous junction (British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification ‘b’) over intratendinous injuries (British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification ‘c’).</ABS><PAGE>599-609</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Professional perspectives on the key considerations for aerobic exercise in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy</TEXT><ABS>Abstract. Objectives. This study aimed to understand the key factors experienced accredited exercise physiologists (AEPs) and medical professionals consider when prescribing/recommending aerobic exercise to patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Design. Modified Delphi Survey. Methods. A four-round, two-phase survey was conducted. Following a Delphi approach, four cancer-specific AEPs, four oncologists, and one breast cancer surgeon (median 13-yr breast-cancer-specific experience) completed phase one. Eighty-four AEPs (median 5-yr experience) completed phase two. Phase one participants answered open- and close-ended questions regarding key considerations for aerobic exercise in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy, and what information should be collected to guide exercise prescription. All questions and considerations agreed upon in phase one (> 70 % rating 7–9 on a 0–9 Likert Scale) were rated by AEPs in phase two. Results. Key considerations for exercise assessment and prescription aligned closely with exercise guidelines for cancer survivors. Common strategies for exercise individualisation were identified by AEPs, including separating aerobic exercise into 5‐to‐–9-minute bouts when required and avoiding exercising to complete exhaustion. Exercise intensity and duration should be adjusted throughout chemotherapy to improve tolerance and adherence. Novel considerations for subjective questioning and objective assessments to tailor exercise prescription were outlined. Conclusions. This study identifies how professionals approach exercise assessment and prescription in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Findings can guide AEPs in practice when prescribing tailored exercise to breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and inform future guidelines.</ABS><PAGE>650-658</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

A systematic review and meta-analysis</TEXT><ABS>Abstract. Objectives. To provide an updated critical evaluation on the effectiveness of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on health outcomes amongst cancer survivors. Design. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods. A systematic search was conducted using databases CINAHL and Medline (via EBSCOhost platform), Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Randomised, controlled, exercise trials involving cancer survivors were eligible. Data on the effects of HIIT amongst individuals diagnosed with cancer at any stage were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated to compare differences between exercise and usual care. Meta-analyses (including subgroup analyses) were undertaken on the primary outcome of interest, which was aerobic fitness. Secondary outcomes were fatigue, quality of life, physical function, muscle strength, pain, anxiety, depression, upper-body strength, lower-body strength, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Results. Thirty-five trials from forty-seven publications were included, with intervention durations ranging between 4 and 18 weeks. Breast cancer participants were represented in the highest number of trials (n = 13, 37 %). Significant effects in favour of HIIT exercise for improving aerobic fitness, quality of life, pain and diastolic blood pressure were observed (SMD range: 0.25–0.58, all p < 0.01). Conclusions. Participation in HIIT exercise was associated with higher retention and improvements in aerobic fitness, quality of life, pain and diastolic blood pressure. The present results provide updated contemporary evidence for clinicians (e.g., exercise physiologists and physiotherapists) to prescribe HIIT exercise for cancer survivors to improve health before, during and following treatment.</ABS><PAGE>667-675</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. Compare physiological (heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood pressure), performance (change-of-direction task completion time and errors), and clinical (symptoms and rating of perceived exertion) outcomes during dynamic exertion between athletes at return to sport after concussion to healthy athlete controls. Design. Case control. Methods. A sample of 23 (Female = 10; 43.5 %) athletes at medical clearance to play/activity from concussion (CONCUSS) and 23 sex-, age-, and sport-matched healthy athletes (CONTROLS) completed a 5-min seated rest before and after the dynamic exertion test. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare CONCUSS and CONTROLS for completion time, heart rate, and blood pressure; and Mann–Whitney U tests for symptoms, perceived exertion, and errors. A series of ANOVAs were conducted to compare heart rate variability between groups across pre- and post-exercise rest periods. Results. There were no differences in heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, perceived exertion, and errors. CONCUSS were faster on Zig Zag (p = .048) and Pro Agility (p = .018) tasks, reported lower symptom severity (p = .019), and had lower post-EXiT HRV (p < .049) than CONTROLS. Conclusions. Performance, symptoms, perceived exertion, and blood pressure outcomes from dynamic exertion were equivocal between athletes at medical clearance from concussion and healthy controls, which provide empirical support for dynamic exercise to inform medical clearance clinical decision making for sport-related concussion. However, differences in autonomic nervous system functioning indicate that additional research is needed to examine temporal changes in heart rate variability and other physiological outcomes following dynamic exertion.</ABS><PAGE>682-687</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Purpose. Previous work shows that linguistic features (e.g., word length, word frequency) impact the predictability of stuttering events. Most of this work has been conducted using reading tasks. Our study examined how linguistic features impact the predictability of stuttering events during spontaneous speech. Methods. The data were sourced from the FluencyBank database and consisted of interviews with 35 adult stutterers (27,009 words). Three logistic regression mixed models were fit as the primary analyses: one model with four features (i.e., initial phoneme, grammatical function, word length, and word position within a sentence), a second model with six features (i.e., the features from the previous model plus word frequency and neighborhood density), and a third model with nine features (i.e., the features from the previous model plus bigram frequency, word concreteness, and typical age of word acquisition). We compared our models using the Area Under the Curve statistic. Results. The four-feature model revealed that initial phoneme, grammatical function, and word length were predictive of stuttering events. The six-feature model revealed that initial phoneme, word length, word frequency, and neighborhood density were predictive of stuttering events. The nine-feature model was not more predictive than the six-feature model. Conclusion. Linguistic features that were previously found to be predictive of stuttering during reading were predictive of stuttering during spontaneous speech. The results indicate the influence of linguistic processes on the predictability of stuttering events such that words associated with increased planning demands (e.g., longer words, low frequency words) were more likely to be stuttered.</ABS><PAGE>106016</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

This study aimed to adapt the Self-Stigma of Stuttering Scale (4S) into Turkish and evaluate its factor structure, reliability, and validity in Turkish culture. Methods. The original 4S scale was translated into Turkish (4S-TR) using a forward-backward translation technique and was administered to 350 adults who stutter (AWS). To discover latent variables evaluated on the scale, two-factor analyses were performed. Internal consistency and temporal stability were calculated to ensure reliability. Test-retest reliability correlation scores were calculated with multiple applications of the scale within about two weeks. To verify construct validity, participants also completed the Turkish versions of the Self-Esteem Rating Scale-Short Form (BSDÖ-KF) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale(YDÖ). Results. The explanatory factor analysis showed three factors explaining 74.76 % of the total variance. The findings were also validated by confirmatory factor analysis. High levels of internal consistency (r = .89) and test-retest reliability (r = .96) were obtained. In terms of construct validity, our findings revealed that self-stigma has a significant negative correlation with self-esteem (r = −.41) and life satisfaction (r = −.38) as was predicted. Conclusions. The findings demonstrate preliminary evidence that the 4S-TR is a viable and valid instrument for self-stigma evaluation in three domains (stigma awareness, stereotype agreement, and self-concurrence). The 4S-TR can be applied for research and clinical purposes in Turkish.</ABS><PAGE>106020</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

This study aims to examine how stuttering is defined and understood on Instagram, and how users engage with related content. Methods. We analyzed highly engaged Instagram posts with the hashtag "#Stuttering" published within a year and their corresponding comments using thematic analysis. Results. The results revealed four main themes and nine sub-themes that highlighted different understandings of stuttering on Instagram, including the need for intervention, emotional impact on people who stutter, positive meanings, and mental health implications. User engagement varied based on the nature of the post, with users showing appreciation, objections, seeking advice, celebrating success stories, mocking, or advocating for people who stutter. Conclusion. Although Instagram can serve as a means of normalizing stuttering and highlighting success stories, it raises concerns about the promotion of non-evidence-based treatments and the use of stuttering for political or entertainment purposes. This study emphasizes the need to critically evaluate health-related information presented on social media platforms. To provide reliable information to PWS and their families who seek information on social media, it is recommended to promote evidence-based information on stuttering through trustworthy organizations such as the National Stuttering Association or the Stuttering Foundation, particularly on special occasions like International Stuttering Awareness Day.</ABS><PAGE>106021</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Treatment of school-age children (6–12 years of age) who stutter is a public health priority. Their clinical needs include a psychosocial focus and stuttering reduction. For the latter clinical need, there is a critical window of opportunity for these children warranting research attention. Purpose. The purpose of the review is to guide future clinical research by establishing (a) what interventions are associated with stuttering reduction for school-age children (b) the reported immediate and longer-term effects of those interventions, and (c) the level of evidence for these interventions in terms of study design. Methods. Fourteen databases and three conference proceedings were searched for interventions used to reduce stuttering in school-age children. Primary outcomes were mean stuttering reductions pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and any follow-up assessments. Results. Of the 4305 studies identified from the databases, 67 studies met inclusion criteria. Five different treatment approaches were reported in the literature that might reduce stuttering for a school-age child, but with varying effect sizes. These include (a) operant methods, (b) speech restructuring, (c) combined operant methods and speech restructuring, (d) machine-driven treatments, and (e) treatments with a cognitive behaviour therapy component. Conclusions. Operant methods warrant investigation in future clinical trial research, as do variants of speech restructuring. Hybrid approaches showed encouraging results, including speech restructuring variants combined with operant methods or with cognitive behaviour therapy. However, evidence is preliminary only at Phase I and II trials. Several treatments with reported clinical promise have been overlooked for decades and require further investigation.</ABS><PAGE>106015</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Natural recovery from early stuttering</TEXT><ABS>Abstract. Purpose. The Fifth Croatia Stuttering Symposium of 2022 continued the Fourth Croatia Stuttering Symposium 2019 theme of the connection between research and clinical practice. At the 2022 Symposium, there were 145 delegates from 21 countries. This paper documents the contents of the second of three Symposium modules. Methods. The module topic was that some children with early stuttering will recover naturally. A clinical situation was considered where a parent of a 3-year-old child asked if a clinician can predict whether their child will recover from stuttering without treatment. Results. A distinguished scholar presented a 5-minute video interpretation of research about this topic. Three master clinicians then each presented a 2-minute video demonstration of how that research might be applied in a clinical situation. Following that, the convenors moderated a discussion between the distinguished scholar, master clinicians, and delegates regarding the research and how it applies to clinical practice.</ABS><PAGE>106018</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Purpose. To discuss issues about neurodiversity and ableism, and how they pertain to clinical management of stuttering, with particular reference to early childhood stuttering. Methods. During a webinar this year, the issue emerged of how concepts of neurodiversity and ableism apply to early childhood stuttering during the pre-school years. It became apparent that this topic elicited disparate views and would be of particular interest to students of speech-language pathology. Consequently, the leaders of that webinar continued the conversation by written dialogue for the purpose of placing it on record. Results. The discussants reached agreement on many points, but there was some diversity of viewpoint about how neurodiversity and ableism should apply to clinical practice with children who have recently begun to stutter.</ABS><PAGE>106014</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Introduction. The purpose of the study was to compare school-age children who stutter (CWS) and age-matched children who do not stutter (CWNS) in syntactic abilities and syntactic performance. Methods. Computerized Language Sample Analysis (LSA) was conducted on the conversation samples obtained from 46 school-age CWS and CWNS between 7 and 16 years (CWS, n = 23). Syntactic abilities were assessed using the Index of Productive Syntax (the IPsyn) and Developmental Sentence Scores (DSS) and mixed effects logistic regression analyses with participants as random effects were conducted to determine if the scores were predictive of group membership. Additionally, the groups were compared in the IPsyn subcategories to assess the use of syntactic structures. Syntactic performance was assessed by: (a) Categorizing the sentences from each conversation sample into high vs. low syntactic complexity categories based on DSS scores and comparing the sentence categories in % stuttered sentences (% SS); and (b) Comparing the groups in the proportion of phrase-level disfluencies (phrase repetitions vs. revisions) that are associated with syntactic planning. Results. In terms of syntactic abilities, the IPsyn scores interacted with the number of utterances (sample size) used to compute the scores in predicting group membership. In comparison to the CWNS, the CWS obtained higher scores in the IPsyn and the sentence structure subcategory of the IPsyn that were independent of sample size. In terms of syntactic performance: (a) Significantly more sentences were stuttered in the high compared to the low syntactic sentence category; (b) Compared to the CWNS who demonstrated significantly more phrase revisions, the CWS showed comparable and fewer phrase revisions and repetitions. Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed that the CWS used significantly elaborated noun phrases and a similar trend was evident for verb phrase elaborations. A significant association between verb phrase elaborations and%SS was also obtained. Conclusions. Findings from the IPsyn and the use of elaborate noun phrases, and to some extent verb phrases, suggested that the CWS used more complex syntax even in shorter conversational samples. More stuttered sentences in the high DSS sentence category, the use of fewer phrase revisions, and the association between stuttering and elaborated verb phrases in the CWS are interpreted to suggest the effects of syntactic planning and reformulation demands on fluency during ongoing articulation.</ABS><PAGE>106369</PAGE><LANG>O</LANG></HEAD>

Purpose. There is an emerging view that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is marked by problems with language difficulties, an idea reinforced by the fact that ADHD is highly comorbid with developmental language disorder (DLD). This scoping review provides an overview of literature on language abilities in children with DLD and ADHD while highlighting similarities and differences. Method. A comprehensive search was performed to examine the literature on language abilities in the two disorders, yielding a total of 18 articles that met the inclusion criteria for the present review. Qualitative summaries are provided based on the language domain assessed. Results. The current literature suggests children and adolescents with ADHD have better morphosyntax/grammar, general/core language abilities, receptive, and expressive abilities than those with DLD. Further, that performance is comparable on assessments of semantic and figurative language but varies by sample on assessments of phonological processing, syntax, narrative language, and vocabulary. Conclusion. Evidence presented points to children and adolescents with DLD as having greater language difficulties compared to those with ADHD, but with some important caveats. Despite limitations related to the paucity of studies and inconsistencies in how the two types of disorders are identified, our review provides a necessary and vital step in better understanding the language profiles of these two highly prevalent childhood disorders. These findings are useful in optimizing language outcomes and treatment efficacy for children and adolescents with ADHD and DLD.</ABS><PAGE>106381</PAGE><LANG>O</LANG></HEAD>

Introduction. The purpose of the study was to pilot a working memory (WM) – and modified Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) approach to treat word finding deficits in a group of people with aphasia (PwA). Two research questions were posed: 1. Will the group of PwA be able to complete the WM tasks used in the approach? 2. Will the approach improve naming performance in PwA? Method. Three individuals with mild – moderate aphasia participated in this singlesubject multiple baseline treatment design. Pre-treatment assessments of language, and pre- to post-treatment assessments of WM abilities were carried out. The treatment protocol incorporated WM and linguistic tasks in order to improve naming accuracy across two treatment lists. Probes were carried out prior to treatment on each list, and at one-month following completion of treatment. Two outcome measures were obtained: Percent accuracy in completing the WM steps, and treatment effect sizes (Beeson & Robey, 2006). Additionally, modified t-tests (Crawford & Garthwaite, 2012; Crawford & Howell, 1998), were calculated in which post-treatment WM measures were compared against neurotypical control groups to detect any improvements in WM functions. Results. All three participants completed the WM steps with a high degree of accuracy. A range of small to large ESs were obtained for all three participants across the two treated lists, while no meaningful ESs were obtained for the control (untreated) list. All three participants demonstrated improved scores across most of the WM measures with significant improvements noted on certain WM assessments. Conclusions. The findings revealed that the WM – SFA approach can be used successfully in individuals with mild – moderate aphasia. The proposed approach holds promise as feasible intervention designed to remediate anomia in PwA.</ABS><PAGE>106384</PAGE><LANG>O</LANG></HEAD>

Introduction. Autoimmune neurological diseases (ANDs) are a specific type of autoimmune disease that affect cells within the central and peripheral nervous system. ANDs trigger various physical/neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, language impairments in people with ANDs are not well characterized. Here we aimed to determine the kinds of language impairment that most commonly emerge in 10 ANDs, the characteristics of the patients (demographic, neurological damage), and the assessment methods used. Methods. We followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). PubMed and Google Scholar were searched. We used a list of search terms containing 10 types of ANDs (e.g., multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) in combination with the terms aphasia, dysphasia, fluency, language, listening, morphology, phonology, pragmatics, reading, semantics, speaking, syntax, writing. The reference lists and citations of the relevant papers were also investigated. The type of AND, patient characteristics, neurological damage and examination technique, language tests administered, and main findings were noted for each study meeting the inclusion criteria. Results. We found 171 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. These comprised group studies and case studies. Language impairments differed largely among types of ANDs. Neurological findings were mentioned in most of the papers, but specific language tests were rarely used. Conclusions. Language symptoms in people with ANDs are commonly reported. These are often not full descriptions or only focus on specific time points in the course of the disease. Future research needs to assess specific language functions in people with ANDs and relate their language impairments to brain damage at different stages of disease evolution.</ABS><PAGE>106368</PAGE><LANG>O</LANG></HEAD>

Clinical trials provide Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients access to medication. Nevertheless, such involvement can impose certain burdens, as the protocol may entail strict adherence and additional demands. This study assessed the psychosocial functioning and quality of life in boys with DMD and their parents who participate in clinical trials. DMD families participating in clinical trials (n = 25) and families with DMD patients not involved in clinical trials (N = 18) were included. Questionnaires assessing psychosocial well-being and quality of life were completed by the participants and their parents. MANOVAs were employed to compare outcomes between groups. The results showed that mothers in the clinical trial group experienced significantly higher scores of somatic complaints. Fathers in the clinical trial group reported significantly fewer psychological issues compared to fathers from the other group. DMD patients participating in clinical trials reported a better overall and emotional quality of life compared to them not involved in clinical trials. This study suggests that clinical trial participation may have positive effects on quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. It highlights the importance of providing support and counseling throughout the clinical trial decision making process to minimize potential burden for both eligible and ineligible patients.</ABS><PAGE>877-881</PAGE><LANG>O</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. Psychological interventions for advanced cancer patients are effective in decreasing distress but are not well integrated into cancer care. Oncology nurses are well positioned to deliver such interventions, and their participation may enhance professional satisfaction and wellbeing. Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM) is an evidence-based psychotherapy supporting advanced cancer patients. A CALM-Nurses (CALM-N) training program was developed to teach oncology nurses the basics of CALM for use in daily practice. Feasibility and acceptability of CALM-N and its impact on professional wellbeing were assessed in this pilot study. Data Sources. Fifty-five nurses attended CALM-N in three groups. Thirty-five nurses completed the first e-learning, 29 nurses (83%) attended the first group session, and 22 (63%) attended all sessions. At baseline, 35 questionnaires were collected. Response rate at follow-up was 63% for Jefferson Scale of Empathy (n=22), 66% for self-efficacy scale (n=23), and for subscales of Professional Quality of Life Scale burnout; 51% (n=18), secondary traumatic stress; 49% (n=17), compassion satisfaction; 57% (n=20). A statistically significant increase in self-efficacy was found, but there were no significant changes in PROQOL and empathy. Focus groups suggested CALM-N helped nurses’ understanding of patients and nurse–patient communication and increased reflection and perspective taking. Conclusion. CALM-N is a feasible and acceptable intervention for oncology nurses, with the potential to improve nurse-patient communication and the nurses’ reflective capacities. Implications for Nursing Practice. CALM-N has the potential to improve the capacity of oncology nurses to provide psychosocial care for advanced cancer patients and its application to nursing practice merits further investigation.</ABS><PAGE>151507</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Purpose. Patients with advanced cancer in palliative care often experience physical and psychological symptoms that negatively impact their quality of life (QoL) and spiritual well-being. Music therapy can be used for symptom management in these patients. However, the effectiveness is uncertain. To determine the effectiveness of music therapy on spiritual well-being, QoL, pain, and psychological distress using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data Source. A systematic search was conducted in EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrial.gov registry up to September 2022.Conclusion. The meta-analysis included seven RCTs with a total of 747 advanced cancer patients. Music therapy was found to significantly improve spiritual well-being with a mean difference of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.25 to 0.61, P < .001) in the intervention group compared to the control group. However, no significant group differences were found between the intervention and control groups for QoL (SMD: 0.53, 95% CI: –0.12 to 1.13, P = .11), pain (MD: –0.81, 95% CI: –2.06 to 0.44, P = .20), and psychological distress (SMD: –0.05, 95% CI: –0.41 to 0.32, P = .81). Music therapy can effectively improve the spiritual well-being of palliative care patients. However, its beneficial effects on QoL, pain, and psychological distress were minimal. Implications for Nursing Practice. Music therapy interventions can be introduced to help patients deal with spiritual/existential needs. Future studies should identify optimal characteristics of music therapy interventions to aid in enhancing the quality of palliative care for patients with advanced cancer.</ABS><PAGE>151481</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives.There is a need for better information exchange between primary and secondary care healthcare professionals in cancer patients with limited life expectancy, most of whom prefer to be at home but are admitted frequently at the end of life (EoL). We conducted a file search to assess this among our patients and developed a discharge pathway to decrease readmission rate and dying in hospital. Data Sources. We performed an in-depth file search among 150 patients who died within 1 month after hospital admission (July 2013 to January 2014); 60 were admitted once, and 90 were admitted twice or more. Mean time spent in hospital at EoL was 12 days; 37% died in hospital, and 49% died at home. We included 31 admitted cancer patients at the EoL in whom home-discharge was planned for the intervention (February 2017 to December 2018). Median survival was 24 days, time spent in hospital decreased from 15.5 to 2.5 days, and number of readmissions fell from 2.8 to 0.57. One patient (3.1%) died in hospital, and 77% died at home. And 78% of general practitioners found the provided information useful. Conclusion. A proactive discharge pathway may reduce hospital readmission rates, time spent in hospital, and in-hospital death. Implications for Nursing Practice. Ever more patients with complex care needs at the EoL are being discharged early. Being informed about patients’ wishes, preferences, and treatment options for symptom management at home is essential for doctors and nurses in primary care. A systematic discharge pathway can be useful for information transfer when admitted patients are discharged home.</ABS><PAGE>151506</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. People who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) face inequalities in healthcare and are receiving less palliative and end-of-life care than others with a comparable need. Since the global resolution to improve palliative care made by the World Health Assembly, the World Health Organization, and member states, some progress has been made. However, LGBT+ people are discriminated and marginalized, which leads to suboptimal palliative care. Research on the needs of LGBT+ people and their access to palliative care is limited. Therefore, the aim of this discussion article is to scope unique problems around palliative and end-of-life care for LGBT+ people and identify possible solutions to address these problems with direct links to nursing practice. Data sources. Journal articles and author experience were used for this discussion article. Conclusion. Oncology nurses need to be educated in communication skills, specific assessment tools, and awareness of the history of LGBT+ people. Increasing knowledge for cancer nurses is pivotal because this affects their views, needs, and perceptions in providing palliative and end-of-life care. Implications for Nursing Practice. Oncology nurses have a pivotal role in caring for all cancer patients at the end of their life. LGBT+ patients and their caregivers need competent nurses to support them, especially during transitions. Implementing LGBT+-inclusive education, training, and practice will improve outcomes for LGBT cancer patients and their caregivers, and potentially all patients. More research is needed to implement such training in nursing education. (“LGBT+” has been used throughout the article. There are many arguments in favor of using different variations of the acronym, but for purposes of understanding and ease, LGBT+ is the acronym of choice here.)</ABS><PAGE>151500</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. Albeit treatable, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains incurable. To achieve remaining life years lived well, extended survival should be balanced with optimal health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and timely initiated supportive, palliative, and end-of-life care. The Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC) Global Alliance identified 10 urgent and actionable goals for the decade between 2015 and 2025 to achieve substantial improvement in the lives of patients living with ABC, including MBC. Enhancements are needed for HRQoL, research, quality of care, and survival. We explore the potential of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in addressing these gaps and aim to describe opportunities and current initiatives for improving the MBC care continuum through PROMs. Data sources.

We believe PROMs can make valuable contributions to seven of the 10 goals described: 1) enhancing the understanding of MBC through high-quality data collection, 2) improving HRQoL and raising consideration of survival versus HRQoL, 2) prolonging survival, 4) increasing referral to nonclinical support services, 5) supporting patient–healthcare provider communication, 6) encouraging improvements in healthcare access, and 7) supporting meeting patients’ informational needs. Implications for Nursing Practice. Maximizing the benefits of PROMs requires effective implementation. Because nurses and nurse practitioners are at the forefront of care, they can offer a comprehensive understanding of patients’ needs and play a crucial role in facilitating the integration of PROMs into routine care for MBC patients and ultimately optimizing patients’ outcomes and life years and months left.</ABS><PAGE>151510</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. End-of-life care for cancer patients is one of the most challenging experiences encountered by nurses. Cancer nurses providing end-of-life care may experience compassion fatigue due to prolonged exposure to the suffering and intense emotional reactions of patients, death and the dying, and grieving families. However, the development of resilience and effective coping skills can decrease nurse turnover rates and increase the quality of palliative cancer care. This article discusses the concept of compassion fatigue, how it develops, compassion fatigue experienced by nurses providing palliative cancer care, and the Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Program (CFRP) coping method. Data Sources. Author experience and journal articles were used. . Conclusion Compassion fatigue can occur from secondary traumatic stress and burnout after nurses’ prolonged and intense exposure to helping suffering patients, resulting in decreased ability to care, expend energy, or exhibit empathy and compassion. The CFRP is a structured, comprehensive training program designed to educate nurses about compassion fatigue and enable them to develop a support network, strengthen their coping skills, and improve resilience. Implications for Nursing Practice. It is recommended that the CFRP be included in in-service training in institutions and be applied to oncology nurses at regular intervals in a block program format (1–2 days). Newly recruited oncology nurses in particular should be supported with such training in orientation programs. Institutional managers play an important role in organizing such programs and screening for the risk of compassion fatigue in nurses who provide end-of-life care.</ABS><PAGE>151501</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objective. Evaluate the efficacy of exercise rehabilitation at improving physical function during active treatment for adults diagnosed with a hematological malignancy. Data Source. Systematic review with a multilevel meta-analysis of randomized trails was conducted. Four electronic databases, MEDLINE (EBSCOhost), CINAHL, Scopus, and CENTRAL, were searched using key words and medical subject headings. Articles were screened and assessed against the predetermined eligibility criteria. Data extracted were appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials and the GRADE guidelines. A meta-analysis examined four key clinical objectives. Conclusion. Twelve studies representing a total of 812 participants were included. Analysis of 36 dependent effect sizes from nine studies revealed structured and prescribed exercise interventions improved physical function (SMD = 0.39; 95% CI 0.21–0.57) compared to usual care or an active control. Exercise interventions with a multimodal design consisting of both aerobic and resistance exercise had a statistically significant effect on physical function (P < .001). Exercise intensity also had a statistically significant effect on physical function when prescribed at a moderate (P = .003) and vigorous (P < .001) intensity during active treatment in patients with leukemia or lymphoma. Implications for Nursing Practice. This review suggests individuals diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma can optimize physical function during and immediately post-treatment by attending exercise rehabilitation 3–5 times per weeks performing moderate-vigorous aerobic and resistance exercise. While further research is needed to identify optimal prescription guidelines throughout the treatment continuum, this review underscores the importance for hematology nurses to support patient referrals to exercise oncology professionals to gain positive improvements in physical function.</ABS><PAGE>151504</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. Approvals of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) represent advancements in treatment options for a hard-to-treat population. Nursing care during CAR-T therapy is crucial for patients, their caregivers, and the broader CAR-T therapy care team. This manuscript provides an overview of the CAR-T therapy administration process and describes practical considerations for nursing professionals working with patients who receive CAR-T therapy. Data Sources. Current literature describing CAR-T therapies for RRMM and published guidelines on nursing care during CAR-T therapy administration were identified from a PubMed database search. Literature was synthesized with practical considerations from nurses and nurse practitioners with expertise in the administration of CAR-T therapy for MM. A practical overview of the role of nursing professionals throughout all stages of CAR-T therapy administration for RRMM is provided. Conclusion. Planning, administration, and posttreatment monitoring for CAR-T therapy requires collaboration between nursing professionals and other healthcare providers as patients migrate between community oncology providers and specialized treatment centers. Nurses help with assessment of patient eligibility and patient and caregiver education before CAR-T therapy. They act in diverse roles across various settings involved in CAR-T therapy administration. Finally, nurses contribute to long-term identification and management of CAR-T–associated toxicities. Implications for Nursing Practice. Nurses are crucial to the CAR-T therapy process and make significant contributions to optimizing patient care and subsequent outcomes.</ABS><PAGE>151505</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. To describe the experiences of people diagnosed with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data Sources. Qualitative data were collected through semistructured interviews conducted with people affected by cancer in the Australian context. Following institutional ethical approval, interviews were conducted over Microsoft Teams and Zoom platforms and complied with confidentiality requirements. Data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed, and emergent themes were developed using thematic analysis to understand patient experiences of cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic was disruptive to the daily experiences of supportive care. Four overarching themes were identified related to: 1) the impact on accessing healthcare services, 2) encounters with healthcare professionals, 3) the impact on daily living, and 4) the impact of COVID on psychological well-being. Implications for Nursing Practice. As the COVID-19 pandemic held global consequences on cancer practices, it is recommended that nursing and other multidisciplinary healthcare professionals reflect upon these findings, in the context of planning for future pandemics. We encourage further exploration into the sustainability of telehealth services universally, given the issues highlighted in this study.</ABS><PAGE>151508</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. Mobile devices facilitate the healthcare management of breast cancer. Meanwhile, specialist nurses play an important role in disease management. We established a smartphone-based app that enables patients to raise questions to specialist nurses. We aimed to evaluate whether the information support provided by specialist nurses via smartphone app could improve the treatment adherence of breast cancer patients. Data Source. Breast cancer patients who received surgery and registered for the app between March 2013 and April 2020 were included. Data related to the use of the app, the number of raised questions, and the specific content of each question were retrieved. Overall, 2675 patients were included, with 560 patients raising questions to specialist nurses via the app. Patients with higher educational levels, postmenopause status, and more advanced diseases were more likely to seek informational support via a smartphone app. The treatment adherence was 86.4%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that raising questions was associated with better compliance. Regarding the distribution of questions, 78.8% of patients had questions about the treatment schedule and procedure, 65.9% of patients had questions during the adjuvant treatment, and only 19.6% of patients raised questions about follow-up and rehabilitation. After a median follow-up of 44 months, there was no survival difference between patients who raised questions and those who did not. Conclusion. Seeking information support from specialist nurses was associated with better treatment adherence. The smartphone-based healthcare app enables specialist nurses to provide more conducive service for patients, and validation of this finding in further studies is warranted. Implications for Nursing Practice. Breast cancer patients were more interested in problems with treatment procedures and schedules. Those who asked questions had better treatment adherence. The smartphone-based app could not only provide patients with a platform to seek information support but also help specialist nurses understand the needs of patients.</ABS><PAGE>151511</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an upper limb rehabilitation program on the quality of life in patients who had been first diagnosed breast cancer and subsequently underwent mastectomy. Data Sources. This randomized controlled trial enrolled 48 breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy at a medical center in Taiwan. The patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 24) or control group (n = 24). The patients in the intervention group participated in a 12-week upper limb rehabilitation program involving face-to-face upper limb rehabilitation education and once-a month monitoring of their upper extremity activity. The control group received standard nursing care. Quality of life was assessed through EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR 23 questionnaires at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 after enrollment. Results. Both the intervention and control groups had significantly improved their levels of functioning, symptoms, and quality of life from baseline to week 12 after enrollment. The intervention group showed greater improvements in functioning and symptom levels after the intervention compared to the control group; however, no statistically significant differences were found. Additionally, the levels of global health status/quality of life in both groups gradually increased from baseline to week 12 Conclusion. An upper limb rehabilitation program is effective in improving the functioning and symptoms of breast cancer patients who have undergone mastectomy. Implications for Nursing Practice.  Patients are encouraged to undergo upper limb rehabilitation in order to improve their functioning, symptoms and quality of life.</ABS><PAGE>151512</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. We sought to identify subgroups of patients with distinct joint cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) AND anxiety profiles and evaluate for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as levels of global stress, cancer-specific stress, cumulative life stress, and resilience. Data Sources. Patients (n = 1332) completed the Attentional Function Index and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory six times over two cycles of chemotherapy. Global, cancer-specific, and cumulative life stress and resilience were evaluated using Perceived Stress Scale, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Life Stressor Checklist-Revised, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, respectively. Latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups of patients with distinct joint CRCI AND anxiety profiles. Differences were evaluated using parametric and nonparametric tests. Results. Three classes were identified (ie, No CRCI and Low Anxiety [57.3%], Moderate CRCI and Moderate Anxiety [34.5%], and High CRCI and High Anxiety [8.2%]). All of the stress measures showed a dose-response effect (ie, as the CRCI AND anxiety profile worsened, scores for all three types of stress increased). The two highest symptom classes reported higher occurrence rates for six specific stressors (eg, emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual harassment). Conclusions. Findings suggest that higher levels of co-occurring CRCI AND anxiety are associated with some common risk factors, as well as higher levels of stress and lower levels of resilience. Increased knowledge of modifiable risk factors and sources of stress associated with the co-occurrence of these two symptoms will assist clinicians to identify high-risk patients and implement individualized interventions.</ABS><PAGE>151513</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objective. To critically synthesize and describe the use and methods of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in cancer research. Data Sources. A systematic review was conducted and has been reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Guideline. Electronic databases (APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched using a variety of keywords and subject headings by an expert systematic review librarian. All publications were double screened by two reviewers using predetermined exclusion and inclusion criteria throughout the full review process. The review used Covidence Systematic Review Software. Methodological quality assessment and data extraction were performed. A narrative synthesis was conducted to examine the aim for EMA, the characteristics of the study samples, the EMA sampling procedures, EMA completion rates, outcome measures, and any implications of findings for survivorship care. Conclusion. A total of 42 EMA studies in cancer were included. Most studies used an electronic mobile device to capture EMA data apart from several that used paper diaries. Existing studies were found to have significant heterogeneity in methods and widely varying approaches to design and self-report measurements. While EMA in cancer research holds significant promise to advance cancer care research into the future by increasing ecological validity and reducing retrospective bias and can capture the unique idiographic within-person change over time, in real-time, further research is needed to develop standardized EMA self-report questionnaires. Implications for Nursing Practice. This is the first comprehensive systematic review to describe the use and methods of EMA in cancer research. There is significant heterogeneity in methods and widely varying approaches to design and self-report measurements in EMA cancer research. People affected by cancer found taking part in EMA studies reported benefit from the experience. However, researchers must engage with cancer survivors in the development and co-design of future EMA questionnaires to ensure relevant and acceptability of EMA data collection protocols.</ABS><PAGE>151514</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. Adherence by oncology nurses to chemotherapy safe handling guidelines is essential to prevent hazards of chemotherapy exposure. A review of the literature revealed the need for an instrument with evidence of reliability and validity to measure factors influencing adherence to safe chemotherapy-handling guidelines among oncology nurses. The purpose of this study was to psychometrically test the Oncology Nurses’ Health Behaviors Determinants Scale (HBDS-ON) that measures the mentioned factors. Data Sources. Methodological research of a quantitative cross-sectional survey design was used. The study surveys were administered by email to a sample of 108 oncology nurses. Cronbach alpha, item analysis, exploratory factor analysis using principal axis factoring, and convergence validity testing were used to test reliability and validity. Conclusion. Factor analysis yielded six subscales, each having acceptable internal consistency reliability (Cronbach alpha between 0.70 and 0.88). The subscales included four oncology nurse health beliefs (perceived threat, benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy), cues to action, and personal protective equipment availability and accessibility. Convergence validity testing results support the Oncology Nurses Health Behaviors Determinant Scale (HBDS-ON) construct validity. Oncology nurses’ self-efficacy to adherence to chemotherapy-handling guidelines, the perceived barriers to adhere to chemotherapy-handling guidelines, and cues to action are associated with adherence to chemotherapy-handling guidelines. Implications for Nursing Practice. Oncology nurses’ health beliefs, the cues to action, and personal protection equipment availability and accessibility are important determinants of nurses’ adherence to chemotherapy-handling guidelines. The HBDS-ON is an instrument that has evidence of reliability and validity and could be used in practice to measure these determinants.</ABS><PAGE>151515</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. Physical and cognitive function are two of the most important patient-reported outcomes. In oncology patients receiving chemotherapy (N = 1331), purposes were to identify subgroups of patients with distinct joint physical and cognitive function profiles and evaluate for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, severity of common symptoms, and quality of life outcomes. Data Sources. Measures of physical and cognitive functions were obtained six times over two cycles of chemotherapy. All of the other measures were done prior to the second or third cycle of chemotherapy. Latent profile analysis was done to identify the distinct joint physical and cognitive function profiles. Differences among the profiles were evaluated using parametric and nonparametric tests. Conclusion. Five distinct profiles were identified (ie, Very Low Physical and Low Cognitive Function [18.4%; Both Low], Low Physical and High Cognitive Function [19.8%], Moderate Physical and Low Cognitive Function [26.7%], Changing Physical and Cognitive Function [5.4%], and Normal Physical and Cognitive Function [29.7%]). Patients in the Both Low class had the highest symptom burden and the poorest quality of life. Over 70% of the sample had moderate to severe decrements in one or both of these extremely important patient outcomes. Implications for Nursing Practice.

Objectives. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are commonly used in clinical practice, and an important aspect is how healthcare professionals use these measures to make clinical decisions. This study aimed 1) to understand how remote electronic symptom monitoring using PRO measures can support oncology nurses' clinical decision-making in patients with metastatic lung cancer and 2) to explore factors that potentially can influence how remote symptom monitoring supports clinical decision-making. Data Sources. A qualitative approach using semistructured interviews was conducted with 18 registered nurses working with remote symptom monitoring at oncology departments at eight Danish hospitals. Conclusion. Nurses reported that remote symptom monitoring supports clinical decision-making because it assisted in identifying relevant problems, monitoring relevant changes over time, and prompting relevant clinical actions. Factors that affected how remote symptom monitoring could support clinical decision-making were access to supplemental information, the trustworthiness of PRO data, nursing competencies and responsibilities, working conditions, and care at a distance. Implication for Nursing Practice. The use of PRO data in the clinical decision-making process is highly dependent on the nurses' professional competencies, the organizational structure, and the trustworthiness of PRO data. Thus, we recommend considering these factors before implementing PRO data in routine care. For example, train clinical staff in using PRO data in their clinical decision-making, develop guidance for how to use PRO data with other forms of data to make sound clinical actions, and ensure that organizational resources are sufficient.</ABS><PAGE>151517</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of arm- and back-support exoskeletons on reactive balance after slip-like and trip-like perturbations on a treadmill. Twenty-eight participants used two arm-support exoskeletons and two back-support exoskeletons with support (i.e., assistive joint torque) activated or deactivated. In each exoskeleton condition, as well in as a control without any exoskeleton, participants were exposed to 12 treadmill perturbations during upright standing. The exoskeletons did not significantly increase the probability of a failed recovery after the perturbations compared to wearing no exoskeleton, but did elicit effects on kinematic variables that suggested balance recovery was more challenging. Moreover, reactive balance differed when wearing back-support and arm-support exoskeletons, and when wearing an activated exoskeleton compared to a deactivated exoskeleton. Together, our results suggest these exoskeletons may increase the risk of slip- and trip-induced falls. The potential mechanisms of this increased risk are discussed and include the added mass and/or motion restrictions associated with wearing these exoskeletons. Our results do not support the assistive hip/back extension moment provided by back-support exoskeletons adversely affecting fall risk.</ABS><PAGE>104178</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The identification of personalized preventive strategies plays a major role in contrasting the occurrence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This requires the identification of distinct movement patterns within large samples and the attribution of a proper risk level to each identified movement phenotype. We assessed the feasibility of this approach by exploiting wearable inertial measurement units to estimate the whole-body kinematics of 43 healthy participants performing 18 reach-to-manipulate movements, which differed based on the object's position in the space and the type of manipulation required. Through unsupervised clustering, we identified multiple movement phenotypes graded by ergonomic performance. Furthermore, we determined which joints mostly contributed to instantiating the ergonomic differences across clusters, emphasizing the importance of monitoring this aspect during occupational gestures. Overall, our analysis suggests that movement phenotypes can be identified within occupational motor repertoires. Assigning individual performance to specific phenotypes has the potential to inform the development of more effective and tailored interventions.</ABS><PAGE>104182</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

This study investigated the effects of back muscle fatigue on the estimation of low-back loads and active low-back moments during lifting, using an EMG and kinematics based model calibrated with data from an unfatigued state. Fourteen participants performed lifting tasks in unfatigued and fatigued states. Fatigue was induced through semi-static forward bending. EMG, kinematics, and ground reaction forces were measured, and low-back loads were estimated using inverse dynamics and EMG-driven muscle model. A regression model was developed using data from a set of calibration lifts, and its accuracy was evaluated for unfatigued and fatigued lifts. During the fatigue-inducing task, the EMG amplitude increased by 2.8 %MVC, representing a 38% increase relative to the initial value. However, during the fatigued lifts, the peak EMG amplitude was found to be 1.6 %MVC higher than that observed during the unfatigued lifts, representing a mere 4% increase relative to the baseline unfatigued peak EMG amplitude. Kinematics and low-back load estimates remained unaffected. Regression model estimation errors remained unaffected for 5 kg lifts, but increased by no more than 5% of the peak active low-back moment for 15 kg lifts. We conclude that the regression-based estimation quality of active low-back moments can be maintained during periods of muscle fatigue, although errors may slightly increase for heavier loads.</ABS><PAGE>102815</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Trunk extensor muscle fatigue typically manifests as a decline in spectral content of surface electromyography. However, previous research on the relationship of this decline with trunk extensor muscle endurance have shown inconsistent results. The decline of spectral content mainly reflects the decrease in average motor unit action potential conduction velocity (CV). We evaluated whether the rate of change in CV, as well as two approaches employing the change in spectral content, are related to trunk extensor muscle endurance. Fourteen healthy male participants without a low-back pain history performed a non-strictly controlled static forward trunk bending trial until exhaustion while standing. For 13 participants, physiologically plausible CV estimates were obtained from high-density surface electromyography bilaterally from T6 to L5. Laterally between L1 and L2, the linear rate of CV change was strongly correlated to endurance time (R2 = 0.79), whereas analyses involving the linear rate of change in spectral measures showed a lower (R2 = 0.38) or no correlation. For medial electrode locations, estimating CV and its relationship with endurance time was less successful, while the linear rate of change in spectral measures correlated moderately to endurance time (R2 = 0.44; R2 = 0.56). This study provides guidance on monitoring trunk extensor muscle fatigue development using electromyography.</ABS><PAGE>102830</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Purpose. Muscle elasticity can be quantified with shear wave elastography (SWE) and has been used as an estimate of muscle force but reliability has not been established for lower leg muscles. The purpose of this study was to examine the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of elasticity measures in non-weight-bearing (NWB) and weight-bearing (WB) for the tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneal longus (PL), and peroneal brevis (PB) muscles using SWE. Methods. A total of 109 recreationally active healthy adults participated. The study employed a single-cohort, same-day repeated-measures test–retest design. Elasticity, measured in kilopascals as the Young’s modulus, was converted to the shear modulus. All four muscles were measured in NWB and at 90% WB. Results. Intra-rater reliability estimates were good to excellent for NWB (ICC = 0.930–0.988) and WB (ICC = 0.877–0.978) measures. Inter-rater reliability estimates were moderate to good (ICC = 0.500–0.795) for NWB measures and poor to good (ICC = 0.346–0.910) for WB measures. Conclusion. Despite the studies poor to good inter-rater variability, the intra-rater reproducibility represents the potential benefit of SWE in NWB and WB. Establishing the reliability of SWE with clinical and biomechanical approaches may aid in improved understanding of the mechanical properties of muscle.</ABS><PAGE>102813</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The smallest voluntarily controlled structure of the human body is the motor unit (MU), comprised of a motoneuron and its innervated fibres. MUs have been investigated in neurophysiology research and clinical applications, primarily using electromyographic (EMG) techniques. Nonetheless, EMG (both surface and intramuscular) has a limited detection volume. A recent alternative approach to detect MUs is ultrafast ultrasound (UUS) imaging. The possibility of identifying MU activity from UUS has been shown by blind source separation (BSS) of UUS images, using optimal separation spatial filters. However, this approach has yet to be fully compared with EMG techniques for a large population of unique MU spike trains. Here we identify individual MU activity in UUS images using the BSS method for 401 MU spike trains from eleven participants based on concurrent recordings of either surface or intramuscular EMG from forces up to 30% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force. We assessed the BSS method’s ability to identify MU spike trains from direct comparison with the EMG-derived spike trains as well as twitch areas and temporal profiles from comparison with the spike-triggered-averaged UUS images when using the EMG-derived spikes as triggers. We found a moderate rate of correctly identified spikes (53.0 ± 16.0%) with respect to the EMG-identified firings. However, the MU twitch areas and temporal profiles could still be identified accurately, including at 30% MVC force. These results suggest that the current BSS methods for UUS can accurately identify the location and average twitch of a large pool of MUs in UUS images, providing potential avenues for studying neuromechanics from a large cross-section of the muscle. On the other hand, more advanced methods are needed to address the convolutive and partly non-linear summation of velocities for recovering the full spike trains.</ABS><PAGE>102825</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Tracking scapular motion can be challenging. More research is needed to determine the best practices for scapular measurement in multi-planar tasks. The purpose of this study was to compare the repeatability of scapular kinematics during a functional task protocol calculated from different calibration procedures. It was hypothesized that select poses would improve repeatability in specific tasks. The torso, humerus, and scapula were tracked with optical motion capture in two sessions for ten pain-free participants. Scapular calibrations were completed in five poses: neutral, maximum elevation, 90° abduction, hand to contralateral shoulder, and hand to back. Each participant completed eight functional tasks (Comb Hair, Wash Axilla, Tie Apron, Overhead Reach, Side Reach, Forward Transfer, Floor Lift, Overhead Lift). Scapular angles were calculated with five different calibration procedures and extracted at 30° increments of humeral elevation in each task. Mean difference, limits of agreement, intraclass correlations, and minimal detectable change (MDC) were calculated for each task and elevation level. The inclusion of different calibration poses did not markedly improve outcomes over the maximum elevation double calibration for most tasks. Using this calibration procedure, median MDCs were 10.0° for upward rotation, 13.7° for internal rotation, and 9.8° for tilt.</ABS><PAGE>102829</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals are muscle activation signals, which has applications in muscle diagnosis, rehabilitation, prosthetics, and speech etc. However, they are known to be affected by noises such as Power Line Interference (PLI), motion artifacts etc. Currently, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and its modifications such as Ensemble EMD (EEMD), and Complementary EEMD (CEEMD) are used to decompose EMG into a series of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). The denoised EMG can be obtained from the selected IMFs. Statistical methods are used to select the signal dominant IMFs to reconstruct the denoised signal. In this work, a novel procedure is proposed to automatically separate noisy IMFs from the original sEMG signal. For this purpose, Permutation Entropy (PE) is employed in EEMD sifting process called Partly EEMD (PEEMD), to separate the noisy IMFs from the original sEMG signal according to the preset PE threshold. PEEMD decomposes the original signal into various modes according to a preset PE threshold and the denoised signal is reconstructed from resultant IMFs. The PEEMD denoising procedure is applied on the experimental sEMG data collected from eight subjects, that include six various upper limb movement classes. The proposed denoising procedure achieved an improved denoising performance in comparison with EMD, EEMD, and CEEMD. An alternate measure called Sample Entropy (SE) is also used in place of PE, for the automated sifting process as a comparison. Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Reconstruction Error (RE) parameters are used to evaluate the denoising performance. The results, averaged across eight subjects, demonstrate that the proposed denoising procedure outperforms the state-of-the-art EMD techniques in terms of these performance measures on the experimentally collected sEMG data samples.</ABS><PAGE>102834</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Purpose. This study aimed i) to investigate the mechanical, morphological, and compositional characteristics of the supraspinatus muscle after rotator cuff repair by using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) and B-mode imaging, and ii) to determine whether the morphological or compositional characteristics are associated with the mechanical characteristic of the supraspinatus during contraction. Methods. Using SWE and B-mode imaging, active and passive shear moduli, muscle thickness, and echo intensity of the supraspinatus were measured from the repaired and contralateral control shoulders of 22 patients with rotator cuff repair. The shear modulus, muscle thickness, and echo intensity were compared between the repaired and control shoulders. The association between the active shear modulus and the other variables was determined. Results. While the active and passive shear moduli were lower in the repaired shoulder compared to the control, the muscle thickness and echo intensity did not vary between them. Interestingly, the passive shear modulus was positively correlated with the active shear modulus only in the control shoulder. Conclusion. The mechanical characteristic of supraspinatus remains impaired, even without degenerative changes in the morphological and compositional characteristics after rotator cuff repair. Furthermore, the association between contractile and elastic characteristics in the supraspinatus was deteriorated in control shoulder.</ABS><PAGE>102831</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The purpose of our study was to compare the influence of two types of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on the performance of older adults on the 6-min test of walking endurance and on the ability to maintain balance during upright standing. Twenty-six healthy older adults (72 ± 5.4 yrs) performed tests of motor function while TENS was applied to the tibialis anterior and rectus femoris muscles of each leg. Linear mixed models were used to compare the influence of TENS on walking distance in a 6-min test of walking endurance and on sway-area rate in tests of standing balance. There was a significant decrease in the distances walked in each minute of the 6-min walk test for both the Continuous and Burst TENS modes compared with Baseline (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). The influence of TENS on walking distance was associated with several significant effects on the mean and coefficient of variation for stride length and stride frequency between the first and last minute of the test and between the two TENS modes and the Baseline values. In contrast, there was no significant effect of TENS on sway-area rate in any balance test, which indicates that the supplementary sensory feedback compromised walking performance of older adults but not the ability to maintain balance during upright standing.</ABS><PAGE>102827</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The aim of the study was to assess the potential influence of footedness and dominance on maximal force, force fluctuations and neural drive during dorsiflexion. Fifteen left-footed (LF) and fifteen right-footed (RF) young adults performed 2 maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) and 3 steady submaximal isometric contractions at five target forces (5, 10, 20, 40 and 60% MVC) with the dorsiflexors of both legs. High-density electromyography (EMG) was used to record the discharge characteristics of motor units (MUs) of Tibialis Anterior. MVC force and EMG amplitude (root mean square) were similar between the two legs and groups (p > 0.05). Force fluctuations (Coefficient of Variation, CoV for force), mean discharge rate of MUs, discharge variability (CoV of interspike interval), and variability in neural drive (standard deviation of filtered cumulative spike train) were greater (p < 0.05) and the input–output gain of the MUs (ΔDR/ΔF) was lower (p < 0.05) for the LF relative to the RF group. The differences in force fluctuations during steady contractions with the dorsiflexors were associated with footedness but not with dominance. They reflect greater variability in motor neuron output, as suggested by coefficient of variation for interspike interval (independent input) and the standard deviation of the smoothed discharge times (common input).</ABS><PAGE>102828</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Knee abduction and hip adduction during functional tasks may indicate increased joint injury risk and discriminate between pathological and healthy people. Muscles’ neuromuscular variables such as amplitude (EMGAMP) and onset (EMGONSET) have been used to explain kinematics. The study aimed to evaluate the correlation between two EMG variables of seven trunk and lower limb muscles and 3D kinematics during two tasks. Eighteen physically-active women participated in the study. The following variables were obtained during single-leg squat and anterior step-down: (i) EMGAMP and EMGONSET of fibularis longus (FL), tibialis anterior (TA), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), gluteus medius (GMED), ipsilateral (OB_IL) and contralateral (OB_CL) external obliques and (ii) knee abduction and hip adduction angular displacement (initial angle – angle at 60° of knee flexion). Spearman’s correlation coefficient was calculated between kinematic and EMG variables. Greater knee abduction was correlated with delayed TAONSET, GMEDONSET and OB_ILONSET during step-down. Greater hip adduction was correlated with lower VMAMP, BFAMP and delayed VMONSET during step-down. Although task-specific, these results suggest that EMGONSET may influence knee abduction, while both EMGONSET and EMGAMP may affect hip adduction. The identification of muscle activation patterns in relation to kinematics may help the development of injury prevention and rehabilitation programs.</ABS><PAGE>102833</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

This study aims to identify how spatial distribution of lumbar muscle activity is modulated by different fatigue tasks. Twenty healthy adults performed two different isometric trunk extension endurance tasks (the modified Sorensen test and the inverted modified Sorensen test) until exhaustion. During these tasks, bilateral superficial lumbar muscle activity was recorded using high-density electromyography. The spatial distribution of activation within these muscles was obtained using the centroid coordinates in the medio-lateral and cranio-caudal directions. The effects of task and endurance time (left and right sides) were investigated using repeated measures ANOVA. Results revealed a significant lateral shift of the centroid throughout the fatigue tasks on both sides and no difference between tasks. Significant task × time interaction effects were found for the cranio-caudal direction on both sides showing a significantly more caudal location of the centroid in the modified Sorensen test compared to the inverted test at the beginning of the tasks. Our findings suggest that spatial distribution of lumbar muscle activity is task-dependent in a pre-fatigue stage while an alternative but similar muscle recruitment strategy is used in both tasks to maintain performance in the later stages of muscle fatigue.</ABS><PAGE>102837</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Our aim was to compare three electrical stimulation protocols (P20, P30 and P40), with the same number of stimuli, but different stimulation frequencies (20, 30 and 40 Hz, respectively) and duty cycles [1.2:1.2 s (continuous), 0.8:1.2 s (intermittent) and 0.6:1.2 s (intermittent), respectively). Twitch force and the peak-to-peak M-wave amplitude of the thenar muscles were measured before, during and after each protocol at 1–40 Hz in random order. Twelve healthy adults (23–41 years old) were examined for each protocol in random order and in separate sessions. P20 elicited the highest mean force, and P40 the lowest decrease in percent force at the end of the protocol. Force evoked at 1 and 10 Hz decreased less after P40, compared with P20 and P30. The M-wave amplitude was significantly reduced throughout all protocols, with the largest decrease observed during P30. Although an increase in frequency typically induced earlier and greater decrement in force, this was compensated or even reversed by increasing the interval between each stimulation train, while keeping the number of pulses per stimulation cycle constant. The lesser decrease in M-wave amplitude during P40 compared with P20 indicates that longer between-train intervals may help maintaining the integrity of neuromuscular propagation.</ABS><PAGE>102838</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Understanding the consequences and ecological relevance of muscle fatigue is important to guide the development of strategies to preserve independence. However, few studies have examined walking-related fatigue and the effects on walking instability. Our purpose was to investigate the effects of prolonged walking on leg muscle activity and vulnerability to balance perturbations. Eighteen healthy young adults completed a 30-min walking trial at their preferred walking speed while leg muscle activities were recorded. Before and after the 30-min walk, participants responded to five 5% body weight lateral force perturbations. Time-frequency analysis with wavelet transformation and principal component analyses assessed neuromuscular adaptations of muscles to prolonged walking. Following prolonged walking, we observed a time-dependent increase in EMG intensities at slower frequencies for the soleus and tibialis anterior and a decrease in mean amplitudes for the soleus, lateral gastrocnemius, and semitendinosus. Mean mediolateral CoM displacement following perturbations averaged 21% larger after the 30-min walk. Our results suggest that walking for 30 min at a comfortable speed elicits complex neuromuscular adaptations indicative of local muscle fatigue and an increased vulnerability to walking balance perturbations. These findings could inform fatigue monitoring systems or walking assistive devices aimed at reducing walking-related fatigue and maintaining independent mobility.</ABS><PAGE>102836</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The study investigated the effects of periarticular knee pressure stimuli on quadriceps strength and neuromuscular activity in subjects with knee osteoarthritis. Twenty-five subjects with knee osteoarthritis and 25 age-matched healthy controls performed maximal voluntary knee extension tasks on an isometric dynamometer. Three different pressure stimuli (no-pressure, 60-mmHg, 120-mmHg) were applied using a sphygmomanometer via the cuff covering the knee joint. Peak torque and root-mean-square peak of rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM), and vastus lateralis (VL) were collected and normalized for the no-pressure condition (nTorque-peak and nRMS-peak). Normalized Torque-peak increased from no-pressure to 60-mmHg and 120-mmHg in patients, which revealed higher nTorque-peak during 60-mmHg (MD: 10.9%, IC95: 1.8%, 20.1%, p = 0.020) and 120-mmHg (MD: 16.0%, IC95: 4.4%, 27.6%, p = 0.008) conditions than healthy subjects. Moreover, nRMS-peak increased from no-pressure to 60-mmHg for RF, from no-pressure to 120-mmHg for RF, VM and VL, and from 60-mmHg to 120 mm-Hg for VL in patients. Patients revealed higher nRMS-peak of RF and VM during 60-mmHg and 120-mmHg conditions than healthy subjects. Periarticular knee pressure stimuli enhanced quadriceps strength and neuromuscular activity in subjects with knee osteoarthritis.

The habitual use of resistance exercises involving concentric and eccentric contractions can increase muscle strength, speed and endurance. However, current knowledge has limited potential to fully understand the application of such resistance training and the muscle changes that occur to differentiate these two types of training. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of concentric contraction (CON) and eccentric contraction (ECC) during an acute bout of resistance training on the hamstring contractile properties. A group of 20 female recreational athletes were divided into two equal groups, CON training and ECC training. The contractile properties of the muscles on both sides of the body were assessed using tensiomyography (TMG): biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST). The muscles were assessed twice, before and after 10 maximal repetitions of either concentric or eccentric isotonic contractions. The results indicate a greater change in TMG parameters with ECC training, with p < 0.001 (Td and Tc). An acute bout of resistance training induces changes in the muscle hamstrings contractile properties in both CON and ECC training. Eccentric training causes greater changes than concentric training, shortening contraction time (Td, Tc), increase radial displacement velocity (Vrd) and affecting changes in muscle belly displacement (Dm), so may be more effective in training.</ABS><PAGE>102824</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The use of shear wave elastography during voluntary contraction has enabled the non-invasive assessment of load sharing strategies between agonist muscles. However, the change in joint angle and voluntary contraction intensity can modify contribution between muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of knee joint angle on the local mechanical properties of the vastus medialis (VM) and the vastus lateralis (VL) during isometric submaximal voluntary contractions from shear wave elastography mapping. The VM and VL Young’s modulus at rest and during constant isometric submaximal voluntary contractions (i.e., 25%, 50% and 75% of maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]) were assessed for two knee angles (50° and 100° | knee fully extended = 0°) in twelve participants. No significant difference was found in the VM Young’s modulus among all torque levels and knee angles (p > 0.05). VL Young’s modulus was significantly higher at 25% MVC for a knee angle of 100° than at 75% MVC for the same knee angle and was greater at 25% MVC for a knee angle of 100° than for 50° (p < 0.05). In contrast to the VM, the contribution of the VL to the knee joint torque production during isometric voluntary contraction appears to depend on the muscle length and the relative knee extension torque level.</ABS><PAGE>102826</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Changes in spinal kinematic variability have been observed in people with chronic non-specific LBP (CNSLBP) during the performance of various repetitive functional tasks. However, the direction of these changes (i.e., less or more kinematic variability) is not consistent. This study aimed to assess differences in kinematic variability of the 3D angular displacement of thoracic and lumbar spinal segments in people with CNSLBP compared to asymptomatic individuals during a repetitive lifting task. Eleven people with CNSLBP and 11 asymptomatic volunteers performed 10 cycles of multi-planar lifting movements while spinal kinematics were recorded. For the three planes of motion, point-by-point standard deviations (SDs) were computed across all cycles of lifting and the average was calculated as a measure of kinematic variability for both segments. People with CNSLBP displayed higher thoracic (F = 8.00, p = 0.010, ηp2 = 0.286) and lumbar kinematic variability (F = 5.48, p = 0.030, ηp2 = 0.215) in the sagittal plane. Moreover, group differences were observed in the transversal plane for thoracic (F = 7.62, p = 0.012, ηp2 = 0.276) and lumbar kinematic variability (F = 5.402, p = 0.031, ηp2 = 0.213), as well as in the frontal plane for thoracic (F = 7.27, p = 0.014, ηp2 = 0.267) and lumbar kinematic variability (F = 6.11, p = 0.022, ηp2 = 0.234), all showing higher variability in those with CNSLBP. A significant main effect of group was not detected (p > 0.05) for spinal range of motion (ROM). Thus, people with CNSLBP completed the lifting task with the same ROM in all three planes of motion as observed for asymptomatic individuals, yet they performed the lifting task with higher spinal kinematic cycle-to-cycle variation. </ABS><PAGE>102832</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

This study aimed to investigate whether 4 weeks of unilateral resistance training (RT) could attenuate the decline in muscle function in the contralateral limb of older women recreationally engaged in RT compared to control group (CTL). Twenty-four participants completed a 10-week RT before the cross-education (CR-Edu) phase and subsequent detraining. Afterward, participants were randomized into two groups: CTL (n = 8 women, n = 16 legs) who underwent 4 weeks of detraining without any training, and CR-Edu (n = 16 women, n = 16 legs) who performed 4 weeks of unilateral RT. Muscle force, power, and surface electromyography were measured unilaterally before and after the 4-week period, using five repetitions conducted at 40% and 60% of the 1RM. The results showed a reduction in muscle force at both 40% and 60% of 1RM, as well as a decrease in power at 60% of 1RM (P-time < 0.05) without significant differences between the two groups (P interaction > 0.05). There was a decline in power at 60% of 1RM (P-time < 0.05) but no significant change at 40% of 1RM (P-time > 0.05), and again, no significant differences were observed between the groups (P-interaction > 0.05). The surface electromyography of vastus lateralis decreased only in the CTL group (P-interaction < 0.05). Older women recreationally engaged in RT who perform in unilateral leg extension compared to a brief period of detraining seem not to retain muscle force and power, and sEMG amplitude of their homologous and contralateral limb.</ABS><PAGE>102835</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability in the workplace, often caused by manually lifting of heavy loads. Instrumental-based assessment tools are used to quantitatively assess the biomechanical risk of lifting activities. This study aims to verify that, during the execution of fatiguing frequency-dependent lifting, high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) allows the discrimination of healthy controls (HC) versus people with LBP and biomechanical risk levels. Fifteen HC and eight people with LBP performed three lifting tasks with a progressively increasing lifting index, each lasting 15 min. Erector spinae (ES) activity was recorded using HDsEMG and amplitude parameters were calculated to characterize the spatial distribution of muscle activity. LBP group showed a less ES activity than HC (lower root mean square across the grid and of the activation region) and an involvement of the same muscular area across the task (lower coefficient of variation of the center of gravity of muscle activity). The results indicate the usefulness of HDsEMG parameters to classify risk levels for both HC and LBP groups and to determine differences between them. The findings suggest that the use of HDsEMG could expand the capabilities of existing instrumental-based tools for biomechanical risk classification during lifting activities.</ABS><PAGE>102839</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objective. Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) can have a negative impact on functional capacity, symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study aimed to i) investigate the recovery of muscle strength, functional capacity, symptoms, and HRQOL in patients after a severe AECOPD; ii) compare with matched patients with stable COPD (SCOPD); and iii) assess whether these assessments at hospital discharge could discriminate patients’ risk for future events. Methods. This observational study assessed patients with AECOPD during hospital discharge (T1) and one month after discharge (T2). Patients with SCOPD were assessed once. Quadriceps force, handgrip strength, short physical performance battery (SPPB), 6-min walk distance (6 MWD), COPD assessment test (CAT), London chest activity of daily living (LCADL), modified medical research council, checklist individual strength-fatigue, patient health questionnaire, and physical activity (Actigraph) were measured. Exacerbation-related readmission and mortality within six months and 1-year were collected. Results. Forty-four patients with AECOPD were matched with 44 patients with SCOPD. At T2, a significant improvement was found for the SPPB total score, 6 MWD, CAT score, and LCADL score. Compared to patients with SCOPD, a worse LCADL score was found at T2 in patients with AECOPD. Patients with AECOPD that were readmitted or died had a worse SPPB classification and five-repetition sit-to-stand test at T1. Conclusion. Patients after severe AECOPD improved in functional capacity and HRQOL one month after hospital discharge, but ADL performance was still worse compared to SCOPD. Patients who were readmitted or died had significantly worse scores on functional tests at hospital discharge.</ABS><PAGE>107437</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. A Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) phenotype is a single or group of disease characteristics that describe differences between individuals based on clinically important factors such as symptoms, exacerbations, morbidity, and treatment responses. Many studies estimated the prevalence of various phenotypes, but very few studies looked into their quality of life. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of different COPD phenotypes and their disease-specific Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). Materials and methods. The prospective study, with a sample size of 136, was conducted between May 2021 and December 2022 in a tertiary teaching institute. Based on their clinical features, COPD patients were classified into 4 different clinical phenotypes, and their disease-specific quality of life was assessed using St. George Respiratory Questionnaire-COPD(SGRQ-c) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) questionnaires. Results. Among 136 COPD patients, the frequency of Non-Exacerbator (NE), Exacerbator Emphysema (EEM), Exacerbator Chronic Bronchitis (ECB), and Asthma COPD overlap (ACO) phenotypes was 79(58.1 %), 16(11.8 %), 31(22.8 %), and 10(7.4 %) respectively. Based on the SGRQ-c score, the ECB and EEM phenotypes had a significantly poorer Quality of life (QoL) when compared with NE(P<0.0001), ACO(P=0.011), phenotypes. Similarly, ECB and EEM phenotypes had significantly poorer QoL when compared to NE(P<0.0001), and ACO(P=0.015), based on the CAT score. ECB and EEM patients also had the worst scores in all individual CAT items and SGRQ-c components. Conclusion. NE was the most common followed by ECB phenotype. ECB and EEM phenotypes recorded the poorest quality of life without any significant differences among them. Further research is needed in the future to determine whether phenotype-specific therapies can produce better clinical outcomes.</ABS><PAGE>107452</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objectives. To evaluate trends in the prevalence of physical activity (PA) from 2014 to 2020; to identify sex differences and sociodemographic and health-related factors associated with PA in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); and to compare PA between individuals with and without COPD. Methods. Cross-sectional and case-control study. Source: European Health Interview Surveys for Spain (EHISS) conducted in 2014 and 2020. We included sociodemographic and health-related covariates. We compared individuals with and without COPD after matching for age and sex. Results. The number of adults with COPD was 1086 and 910 in EHISS2014 and EHISS2020, respectively. In this population, self-reported “Medium or high frequency of PA” remained stable (42.9% in 2014 and 43.5% in 2020; p = 0.779). However, the percentage who walked on two or more days per week rose significantly over time (63.4%–69.9%; p = 0.004). Men with COPD reported more PA than women with COPD in both surveys. After matching, significantly lower levels of PA were recorded in COPD patients than in adults without COPD. Multivariable logistic regression confirmed this trend in COPD patients and showed that male sex, younger age, higher educational level, very good/good self-perceived health, and absence of comorbidities, obesity, and smoking were associated with more frequent PA. Conclusions. The temporal trend in PA among Spanish adults with COPD is favorable, although there is much room for improvement. Insufficient PA is more prevalent in these patients than in the general population. Sex differences were found, with significantly more frequent PA among males with COPD.</ABS><PAGE>107458</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Rationale. The association between self-report falling risk in persons with COPD and hospitalization has not been previously explored. Objective. To examine whether self-reported risk is associated with hospitalizations in patients with COPD. Methods. A secondary analysis from a prospective observational cohort study of veterans with COPD. Participants completed questions from the Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths and Injuries (STEADI) tool kit at either baseline or at the end of the 12-month study. A prospective or cross-sectional analysis examined the association between responses to the STEADI questions and risk of all-cause or COPD hospitalizations. Results. Participants (N = 388) had a mean age of 69.6 ± 7.5 years, predominately male (96 %), and 144 (37.1 %) reported having fallen in the last year. More than half reported feeling unsteady with walking (52.6 %) or needing to use their arms to stand up from a chair (61.1 %). A third were concerned about falling (33.3 %). Three questions were associated with all-cause (not COPD) hospitalization in both unadjusted and adjusted cross-sectional analysis (N = 213): “fallen in the past year” (IRR 1.77, 95 % CI 1.10 to 2.86); “unsteady when walking” (IRR 1.88, 95 % CI 1.14 to 3.10); “advised to use a cane or walker” (IRR 1.89, 95 % CI 1.16 to 3.08). Conclusions. The prevalence of self-reported falling risk was high in this sample of veterans with COPD. The association between falling risk and all-cause hospitalization suggests that non-COPD hospitalizations can negatively impact intrinsic risk factors for falling. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of all-cause hospitalization on falling risk in persons with COPD.</ABS><PAGE>107466</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Melatonin (MLT), the main product of the pineal gland, is involved in muscle tissue repair and regeneration, besides several other important physiologic functions. In COPD, MLT administration can improve lung oxidative stress and sleep quality, but its potential effects on the outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) have not been previously investigated. A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to test the hypothesis that a combined approach of rehabilitative exercise training and MLT supplementation could maximize functional performance, health status and quality of life in patients with COPD. Thirty-nine individuals with COPD referred to a supervised PR program at the Federal University of Ceara, Brazil, were randomized to receive MLT (3 mg/day; n = 18) or placebo (n = 21). Exercise capacity (6-min walk test – 6MWT), health status (COPD assessment test), and quality of life (airways questionnaire 20) were investigated as primary outcomes. No differences were observed at baseline in demographic, anthropometric and clinical characteristics between MLT and placebo groups. At the end of PR, superiority of the MLT group was demonstrated in improvement in the distance covered in the 6MWT (71 ± 26 vs. 25 ± 36 m; p < 0.01), health status (−11 ± 6 vs. −3 ± 5; p < 0.01), and quality of life (−6.9 ± 3.0 vs. −1.9 ± 2.4; p < 0.01), compared to the placebo group. In conclusion, MLT supplementation during the course of 12 weeks of PR can improve functional capacity, health status and quality of life in patients with COPD. These findings may have significant implications for the management of this condition.</ABS><PAGE>107441</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Wearing facemasks in public is effective in preventing viral transmission. However, no study has evaluated the impact of wearing facemasks during exercise on dyspnea in patients with chronic pulmonary infections from multifaceted aspects, including sensory qualities and emotional responses. The aim of this study was to evaluate facemask-related dyspnea during exercise in this patient population. Methods. We conducted a randomized crossover study involving adult patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) or bronchiectasis who participated in exercise sessions, both with (mask-on) and without (mask-off) surgical facemasks. The sensory and emotional dimensions of dyspnea during each exercise session were assessed using the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile. Statistical analyses were performed to identify factors associated with worsening scores for each dimension. Results. Thirty-four patients (mean age [standard deviation]: 71.6 [8.6] years) were included in the analysis. The median [interquartile range] total scores for the sensory and emotional dimensions of dyspnea were 3.5 [1, 9.5] (mask-off) vs. 10 [5.5, 23.8] (mask-on) (P < 0.001) and 0 [0, 5] (mask-off) vs. 3 [0.8, 10.3] (mask-on) (P = 0.115), respectively. “Air hunger” was the primary sensory descriptor of mask-related dyspnea. Vital capacity (VC) < 80% of the predicted value was a significant risk factor for worsening sensory dimension scores when wearing masks (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 5.5 [1.16–26.1], P = 0.038). Conclusions. The findings of this study indicate that patients with NTM-PD or bronchiectasis, particularly those with VC <80% of the predicted value, are likely to experience the sensory dimension of dyspnea during exercise while wearing surgical facemasks.</ABS><PAGE>107453</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objective. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the impact of resistance training on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and depression among older adults aged 60 years or older. Method. Four electronic databases were systematically searched. Results. A total of 11 randomized controlled trials, with a pooled sample of 868 participants, met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis demonstrated that resistance training significantly improved circulating BDNF levels (mean difference; MD: 0.73 ng/ml; 95% CI [0.04, 1.42]; p = 0.04). Additionally, resistance training was associated with significant improvements in depression (standardized mean difference; SMD: -0.38; 95% CI [− 0.62, -0.14]; p = 0.002). Discussion. These findings suggest that resistance training may be an effective intervention for improving BDNF levels and reducing depression symptoms in older adults.

Objective. To translate and cross-culturally adapt the Self-efficacy Scale for Daily Life Activities among Older Adults (SSDLAOA) into Chinese, as well as to examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the SSDLAOA (C-SSDLAOA) in a Chinese community-based older adult population. Methods. This study used a cross-sectional survey. The psychometric properties of the C-SSDLAOA were evaluated among 355 older adults recruited from three communities in Huzhou, including internal reliability, test-retest reliability, face validity, content validity, construct validity, and concurrent validity. Results. The C-SSDLAOA was consistent with the original version, which consisted of five dimensions and 23 items. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit for each indicator (χ2 /df=1.387, RMSEA = 0.043, CFI = 0.967, TLI = 0.962, and SRMR = 0.042). The Cronbach's alpha was 0.909, and the test-retest reliability was 0.966, with good internal consistency and stability. The content validity index of the items ranged from 0.83 to 1.00, while the content validity index of the scale was 0.96. The correlation between the C-SSDLAOA and GSES was 0.886, with good concurrent validity. Conclusions. The C-SSDLAOA is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing self-efficacy for daily life activities in Chinese community-dwelling older adults.</ABS><PAGE>46-53</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of 12 weeks of resistance training (RT) with progressive intensity on factors associated with sarcopenia in older individuals. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 74 participants (64.27 ± 7.06-y-old) who were divided into a control group (n = 37) and an intervention group (n = 37). The intervention group underwent 12 weeks of RT three times a week, with an initial training of 60% and final training of 85% of one-repetition maximum (1RM). Both groups were evaluated before and after the 12-week training period to assess improvements in strength and physical performance. Results. The intervention group showed an increase in physical performance, as evidenced by a reduction in the time to perform the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test (p < 0.01) and the Five Times Sit to Stand Test (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the RT proved to be efficient for increasing hand grip and overall muscular strength, as confirmed through the 1RM test. However, the muscle mass index (MMI) and walking speed did not show any significant alterations in both groups. Conclusions. In conclusion, 12 weeks of RT with progressive intensity has a positive effect on the diagnostic parameters of sarcopenia, leading to improvements in physical performance and muscular strength while maintaining the MMI.</ABS><PAGE>60-65</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

The present study aimed to assess caregiver satisfaction with a telerehabilitation program and remote monitoring for older adults with dementia and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify the factors influencing caregiver satisfaction. This study adopted a mixed-methods approach and was part of a randomized clinical trial, with blinded assessors, comprising two groups: the Intervention Group (IG) receiving a telerehabilitation program involving standardized physical exercises for older adults with dementia, along with caregiver guidelines for the caregiver; and the Control Group (CG) receiving remote monitoring. At baseline, factors related to older adults with dementia and their caregivers were measured. After 12 weeks, caregiver satisfaction with the interventions was assessed. The final sample consisted of 64 pairs of family caregivers and older people with dementia. Caregivers in the IG showed higher satisfaction levels with the intervention, Internet-based treatment, and healthcare received compared to caregivers in the CG. Both groups expressed positive views towards the treatment, with excellent ratings for audio and video quality, and a preference for Internet-based treatment over face-to-face. In the IG, only the amount of time dedicated to caregiving influenced satisfaction with the intervention, whereas in the CG, cognitive and functional performance of the older people influenced satisfaction with remote monitoring. Our findings suggest the potential of the program in providing effective care for older people with dementia and their caregivers.</ABS><PAGE>66-75</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an online multicomponent physical exercise intervention (MPE) on the physical performance (PP) of older adults. A randomized controlled trial was conducted, with 110 participants assigned to either the MPE group or the control group. The MPE group engaged in endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility exercises for at least three days per week, while the control group received educational sessions. PP was evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at baseline and after three months. The intervention group showed a mean increase over control group of 0.81 points on the SPPB scale (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-1.40; p=0.000) and in the tandem balance test with 1.26 more seconds (95% CI 0.21-2.31; p=0.019). These findings suggest that the online MPE intervention is effective in enhancing the PP of community-dwelling older adults, which may contribute to a reduction in functional dependence among this population.</ABS><PAGE>83-93</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. The need for dyadic intervention is enhanced with increasing numbers of older adults with dementia. Studies have shown that sensory art therapies are essential for dementia patients and their caregivers. The effects of dyadic sensory art therapies for people with dementia and their caregivers require further exploration. Objectives. This review aimed to assess the efficacy of dyadic sensory art therapies on neuropsychiatric symptoms and mental function for dementia patients, caregiver burden and psychological state for caregivers, dyad relationship quality for dyads, and evaluate the potential effects of dyadic sensory art therapies on quality of life for both dementia patients and caregivers. Methods. An electronic literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and three Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang and CBM) was conducted up to November 2022. Two reviewers (SZ and QG) worked independently to identify relevant studies. Risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane's and Joanna Briggs Institute's tool. Meta-analyses were conducted using RevMan software 5.4. Results. This systematic review included 15 studies (7 RCTs and 8 quasi-experimental studies). The meta-analysis showed that dyadic sensory art therapies significantly ameliorated neuropsychiatric symptoms (SMD = −0.90, 95% CI −1.61 to −0.20, P = .01), caregiver burden (SMD = −0.75; 95% CI −1.03 to −0.47; P < .001). No significant improvements were found in caregiver depression and quality of life for both patients and caregivers. Conclusions. Dyadic sensory art therapies are generally effective at ameliorating neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver burden. Future studies are encouraged to design large-scale randomized controlled trials with high-quality study to examine and confirm the effectiveness of dyadic sensory art therapies for these dyads composed of dementia patients and their caregivers.</ABS><PAGE>118-128</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Low back pain (LBP) disproportionately affects older black adults, often leading to inadequate treatment due to clinician biases. Objective pain measures are imperative, and Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) shows promise for pain detection. Aim. To determine the impact of listening to home-based preferred web app-based music on underlying pain processing mechanisms at the central nervous level in older black adults aged ≥65 with LBP. Methods. Twenty older black adults with LBP listened to preferred music twice daily for four days using the MUSIC CARE® app. Neuroimaging data were collected using fNIRS. Data were transformed to changes in oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations and analyzed. Results. Significant cortical activation pattern differences were observed between pre-and post-intervention scans, particularly in somatosensory regions. Post-intervention scans showed significantly reduced hemodynamic activities. Conclusion. Preferred music listening has the potential to alleviate pain, and fNIRS emerges as a promising tool for exploring cortical-level pain-related neural circuits.</ABS><PAGE>135-143</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Previous research has suggested that community-based service is beneficial in promoting older adults’ life satisfaction. However, there is limited knowledge of the mediating mechanisms that foster this relationship. Thus, the current study aims to explore the mediating role of psychological resilience in the association between community-based service and life satisfaction among older adults. Using data collected over four rounds of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), this study analyzes the responses of 1439 older adults in China. The results reveal that community-based service is positively related to life satisfaction among older adults. Furthermore, psychological resilience partially mediates this association, highlighting its potential role in promoting life satisfaction. These findings contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between community-based service and older adults’ life satisfaction while offering practical implications for enhancing the life satisfaction of older adults in China.</ABS><PAGE>148-154</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Prognostic avoidance can delay discussions about older hospital patients’ life expectancy. This pilot study examined the effects of a prognostic training program on hospital clinicians’ knowledge and confidence in identifying older patients at risk of dying. Methods. Fifty-seven clinicians from aged care assessment teams at two Australian hospitals were introduced to the Palliative Prognostic Index, a 5-item checklist indicating prognoses between 3 and 6 weeks. Mixed-methods training evaluation included pre-post-training surveys and semi-structured interviews, conducted three months post-training. Results. Clinicians used a combination of experience, knowledge, and intuition as strategies to generate prognoses. Allied health staff relied on intuition more often than medical and nursing staff. Prognostic tools were rarely used. Pre-post-training comparisons showed significant improvements in clinicians’ knowledge and confidence in identifying signs of dying, particularly amongst allied health.

Patients ≥ 65 years at high fall risk were recruited. Feasibility of recruitment was assessed by reaching the goal sample size (200), and recruitment rate (50%). Surveys assessed participants’ readiness to participate in fall prevention activities (confidence to manage fall risks [0–10 scale; 10 most confident] and adherence to fall prevention recommendations). We recruited 200 patients (46.3% of eligible patients), and 185 completed surveys. Participants reported high confidence (range 7.48 to 8.23) in addressing their risks. Their adherence to clinician recommendations was mixed (36.4% to 90.5%). We nearly met our recruitment goals, and found that older adults are confident to address their fall risks, but do not consistently engage in fall prevention recommendations.</ABS><PAGE>246-251</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Introduction. Literature to date describes people with Profound and Multiple Learning Disabilities (PMLD) as pre-linguistic. In contrast, this study explores the existence and use of meaningful sub vocal (SV) language by twenty PMLD participants. Method. The SV utterances of 20 PMLD participants were recorded and amplified. Recordings were investigated for evidence of language content and structure, listener intelligibility, and acoustic and phonetic features relative to normal speech and whisper. Results. Language content and structure was identified. Listener intelligibility was demonstrated. Acoustic and phonetic features relative to normal speech and whisper were evident. Conclusion. Twenty PMLD participants produced meaningful SV language intelligible to listeners. This study requires further robust research to fully confirm its findings but highlights implications for clinical practice and for understanding of PMLD communication competencies. This paper is accompanied by audio samples and transcriptions of recorded utterances to demonstrate the SV language produced by the participants. The quality of the samples varies due to the difficulties in recording SV utterances and the difficulties for participants in articulating clearly. This is not normal speech, but it is normal language. The listener may need to replay samples where the quality of the recording is poor.</ABS><PAGE>104633</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Local political discord together with isolation and fear marked the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Aims. To determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms and analyze adult quality of life (QoL) during the pandemic in four groups: “childless”, “children without mental problems”, “children with autism” and “children with other mental problems.” Methods and procedures. A sample of 867 individuals recruited using social media in northeastern Brazil completed the following instruments: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, Brazilian version), the WHOQOL-Bref, and a sociodemographic form Outcomes and results. The mean score for depression was significantly higher in the “children with autism” group compared to the other groups. The mean anxiety score was significantly higher in the “children with autism” and “childless” groups. Mean QoL scores were lower in the “children with autism” group compared to the other groups for all the domains, with this difference being statistically significant compared with the “children without mental problems” group for all the domains.

Background. Developmental language disorder (DLD) affects the ability to acquire and make use of native language. Possible underlying cognitive mechanisms are related to memory functions. Aims. The aim was examination of the relationship between visual short-term memory of objects as well as audiovisual short-term memory, and particular nonverbal and language abilities. Methods and procedures. The study included 7–9-year-old children with DLD and matched control group. Participants completed the Language Development Test, the Stanford-Binet IQ scale (SB5), and two short-term memory tasks: immediate recall of the visually presented pictograms and immediate recall of audiovisually presented sequences of syllables. Outcomes and results. The results revealed diminished levels of short-term visual memory for objects as well as audiovisual memory in children with DLD. However, there were no group differences in the control task of WM. Conclusions and implications. Results supported the idea of diminished abilities in children with DLD to perform mental operations on verbalizable visual objects. Importantly non-verbal working memory ability, which cannot easily be supported by verbal representations, is at typical levels. This suggests that verbalization ability should be taken into account in the assessment of seemingly non-verbal cognitive functions among children with DLD.</ABS><PAGE>104637</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Few studies have focused on the implications of developmental coordination disorder (DCD) in the teen years. Understanding the unique needs of adolescents with DCD and the challenges they face are imperative to inform clinical care. Aim. To understand how DCD affects daily life from adolescents living with the disorder. Methods. Participants were recruited from a database of adolescents who were formally diagnosed with DCD in childhood. Nineteen semi-structured interviews of adolescents with DCD (13–18 years) were conducted and analyzed using an interpretive description approach. Results. Data analysis revealed four overarching themes: (1) Through the years; (2) Standing out, left out, opting out; (3) Rising into Resilience; and (4) Help me to be me. Adolescents with DCD face challenges in physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and mental health domains, but their success can be optimized through provision of support, fostering social connections, the use of strategies, and increasing public understanding. Few services currently exist for adolescents with DCD, as treatment is not standard of care. Conclusions and implications. Insights gained from this study provide client-centred evidence to advocate for intervention for adolescents with DCD, and guide recommendations for clinical care and community support to meet the needs of this under-served population. What this paper adds? This paper qualitatively explores the lived experience of adolescents with DCD, adding to the limited research within this population. Expanding beyond the typical focus of motor challenges, this paper highlights the widespread influence of DCD on daily life, including in cognitive, mental health, and social-emotional domains. Common environmental contexts that exacerbate challenges during adolescent years are explored, including high school PE class and electives, learning to drive, beginning employment, and preparing for post-secondary education. Through an interpretive description methodology, this paper delves into clinical and practical solutions to support adolescents with DCD, from an individualized and client-centered perspective.</ABS><PAGE>104640</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Aims. The aims of this study were to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adult Bahraini patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and to explore factors associated with poor HRQoL. Methods. Cross-sectional HRQoL data were obtained from a sample of patients in active treatment for DFU at a large public hospital in Bahrain. Patient-reported HRQOL was measured using the following instruments: DFS-SF, CWIS and EQ-5D. Results. The patient sample included 94 patients, with a mean age of 61.8 (SD: 9.9) years, 54 (57.5%) were males, and 68 (72.3%) were native Bahrainis. Poorer HRQoL was found among patients who were unemployed, divorced/widowed, and those with a shorter duration of formal education. Additionally, patients with severe DFUs, persisting ulcers, and a longer duration of diabetes reported statistically significantly poorer HRQoL. Conclusions. Findings from this study demonstrate a low level of HRQoL among Bahraini patients with DFUs. A longer duration of diabetes, in addition to ulcer severity and status statistically significantly influence HRQoL.</ABS><PAGE>465-471</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Objective, To investigate knowledge, attitude and practice of screening pre-ulcerative lesions among endocrinology healthcare workers. Methods, A new questionnaire was developed and distributed online and 1004 valid questionnaires were returned. T-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression were used for statistical analysis. Results. A total of 1100 questionnaires were returned, and 96 were excluded. The scores of endocrinology healthcare workers’ knowledge, attitude, and practice for screening for pre-ulcerative lesions were 45.46 ± 16.26, 92.11 ± 10.50, and 72.27 ± 17.63 respectively. 60.2% participants had been trained to screen for pre-ulcerative lesions, but 39.8% had not been trained. 31.8% of healthcare professionals claimed that their hospital did not have a screening project for pre-ulcer diabetic foot lesions. Positive relationships were found between knowledge and practice and between attitude and practice. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that: level II hospital and tertiary hospital were the main factors influencing the knowledge scores; Undergraduate and participating in relevant training were the main factors influencing the attitude scores; participating in relevant training, hospital conducts relevant projects, and patient cooperation, and working hours were the main factors influencing the practice score. Conclusions. Endocrinology healthcare workers need more knowledge regarding pre-ulcerative lesions, and their screening practices need to be strengthened. Increased education and training for pre-ulcerative lesion screening should be implemented among healthcare workers in endocrinology departments.</ABS><PAGE>472-479</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Aims. Previous research suggested that diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) location could affect transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) values following the angiosome concept. Up to our knowledge no studies have yet analyzed if the location of a diabetic foot ulcer can be a confounding factor that modifies TcPO2 values. The primary aim of this study was to compare the potential healing prognosis of TcPO2 differentiated for diabetic foot ulcers in different angiosome locations. Methods. A 2-years observational cohort prospective study was performed in 81 patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurements were performed at baseline by placing the electrode on two different angiosomes: dorsal zone of the foot (dorsalis pedis angiosome) and between the navicular bone and the tibial malleolus (posterior tibial angiosome). The main outcome was establishing the effectiveness of TcPO2 measurements (dorsalis pedis angiosome and posterior tibial angiosome) for predicting DFU healing. Results. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure probe placed in the dorsum of the foot (dorsalis pedis angiosome) yielded a sensitivity (S) of 95 % and specificity (SP) of 73 %, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.902 (p < 0.001 [0.84–0.96]) for ulcers located in the forefoot and toes; while TcPO2 placed in the posterior tibial angiosome yielded an S of 100 % and SP of 85 % and an AUC of 0.894 (p < 0.001 [0-822-0.966]) for DFU located in the midfoot and heel. Conclusion. This study suggests that angiosome-guided TcPO2 contributes to a prognosis of successful foot ulcer healing.</ABS><PAGE>480-486</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Aims. To investigate the cross-sectional association between deep and superficial diabetic neuropathy, postural impairment assessed by wearable inertial sensors, and the risk of fall among patients with diabetic foot. Methods. Diabetic patients attending a University Podiatric Clinic were evaluated for the presence of deep and superficial peripheral neuropathy in sensory tests. Postural impairment was assessed using a wearable inertial sensor, and the evaluation of balance/gait and risk of fall was determined by the Tinetti Scale and Downton Index, respectively. Glycemic control was measured by glycated haemoglobin concentration and fasting glycaemia. The postural parameters measured were the anteroposterior and medio-lateral sway of the center of mass (CoM) and the sway area (area traveled by the CoM per second). The results were analyzed through a logistic regression model to assess those posture variables mostly significantly associated with neuropathy and risk of fall scales. Results. A total of 85 patients were evaluated. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients showed a strong and significant relationship (p < 0.05) between deep diabetic neuropathy assessed by Semmes-Weinstein monofilament, diapason and biothensiometer and postural alterations, whereas no significant correlations between superficial (painful sensitivity) neuropathy and the postural parameters. The sway path of the displacement along the anterior-posterior axis recorded during tests performed with eyes open and feet close together were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with a poor glycemic (glycated haemoglobin concentration) control and each other with all diabetic neuropathy tests, fall risk scales, muscular weakness, ankle joint limitation and history of ulcers. Conclusions. The results support the existence of a strong association between alterations of the deep somato-sensitive pathway (although depending on the tool used to measure peripheral neuropathy), glycemic control and balance impairments assessed using a wearable sensors. Wearable-based postural analysis might be part of the clinical assessment that enables the detection of balance impairments and the risk of fall in diabetic patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.</ABS><PAGE>516-526</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Background. Deciding whether to transition to wound palliation is challenging for health care professionals because there is no agreed definition or understanding of palliative wound care, including the goals, core elements and differences from general wound management. Objectives. To conduct a scoping review with qualitative synthesis to define palliative wound care in terms of its conceptual framework, goals, principles, components, and differences from general wound management, and provide a new definition of palliative wound care based on this scoping review. Eligibility criteria. Published literature that refers to the definitions, concept, goals and core elements of palliative wound care using any methodological approach, without any time limits, published in English. Sources of evidence. The searches were conducted in CINAHL Complete via Ebsco, Medline via Ovid, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Charting methods. A data extraction form was developed by the review team and used independently for data charting purposes. Braun and Clarke's six phases of thematic analysis guided the qualitative synthesis. Results. A total of 133 publications met the inclusion criteria. Three main themes were developed to define palliative wound care and understand its differences from general wound management: 1- Healing potential of wounds and patient vulnerability, 2- Understanding the impact on individuals and family to address needs, 3- Towards new goals and perspectives in approach to care. Conclusions. Palliative wound care focuses on symptom management, comfort, and dignity, but does not always target the healing of the wound, which is the goal of general wound care. The needs of the individual and their family must be addressed by clinicians through the provision of care and support that takes into account the true meaning of living and dying with a palliative wound.</ABS><PAGE>627-634</PAGE><LANG>E</LANG></HEAD>

Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) lead to fatigue and decreased productivity in workers, resulting in the need for many affected individuals to seek medical treatment annually. Beekeepers, like other agricultural workers, are susceptible to WRMSDs due to the continuous demands of their work and the repetitive movements involved. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of WRMSDs and assess the level of risk associated with different postures among beekeepers to improve their musculoskeletal health. To achieve this, a cross-sectional study was conducted involving 33 beekeepers, consisting of two stages. Firstly, the Nordic Questionnaire was utilized to assess the prevalence of WRMSDs. Subsequently, the Ovako Working Posture Analysis System (OWAS) was employed to analyze and categorize the riskiest postures into four levels of corrective measures. The findings indicate that the most commonly affected areas were the back (51.5%) and waist (45.4%). The occurrence of WRMSDs in various body regions was significantly associated with the beekeepers’ years of experience and weekly working hours. Additionally, the prevalence of neck and back pain was significantly related to their body mass index (BMI). The OWAS postural analysis revealed that the back (36.75%) and arm (21.08%) regions required corrective measures as soon as possible (level III), while the back (26.47%) and legs (14.70%) fell under the category of corrective measures needed in the near future (level II). Combining the postural analysis results, 28.43% were classified as Action Levels (AL) II, 37.73% as level III, and 0.98% as level IV. This study demonstrates that WRMSDs are relatively common among beekeepers, primarily due to their extensive work experience and the adoption of awkward postures during their tasks. As a result, recommendations regarding ergonomics and physiotherapy are provided to alleviate pain and reduce the strain on critical postures.</ABS><PAGE>103504</PAGE><LANG>O</LANG></HEAD>

To investigate the influence of wrist position and torque level on lower arm flexor muscle fatigue. Background. Work-related musculoskeletal health risks at the wrist joint may depend on joint position and torque level, as proposed by ergonomic workplace assessment tools. As empirical data are scarce, muscle fatigue, as proxy of work-related musculoskeletal health risks, can be used to explore this assumption. Method. 18 healthy participants performed fatiguing isometric wrist flexion contractions in three wrist positions (40° flexion, 0° neutral position, and 40° extension) and torque levels (10, 20, 40% of the maximum voluntary contraction). Electromyographic signs of fatigue were analyzed in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. Results. Muscle fatigue was dependent on torque level and wrist position and differed between muscles. Signs of fatigue were more evident at higher torque levels for both muscles. While fatigue signs in FCR were not clearly associated with wrist position, the FDS fatigued more during wrist flexion. An interaction effect between torque level and wrist position was not observed. Conclusion. Higher torque levels induce greater signs of local muscle fatigue in wrist flexor muscles, and a 40° wrist flexion triggers fatigue, while 40° wrist extension does not. Our data do not support the assumption of increased risk in greater wrist angles in any direction by prevailing ergonomic risk assessments. Relevance to industry. People with work-related wrist flexor effort may be at increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders when higher torques are applied and flexed wrist positions are required.</ABS><PAGE>103507</PAGE><LANG>O</LANG></HEAD>
